AB Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) such as IOTA Tangle has been proposed to address the inefficiencies of traditional blockchains, including the issues with scalability, high resource consumptions, and the increasing transaction fees. Despite the promising features introduced by IOTA, the properties of DAG-based distributed ledgers are not yet comprehensively studied. In this work, we propose CIDDS, a configurable and interactive DAG-based DLT simulation framework. CIDDS enables the user to perform large-scale simulations with thousands of nodes and to investigate different characteristics of the network under controlled conditions.

AB The trend in the energy market has led in the last few years the increase in demand (eg the spread of electric vehicles) and an increase in volatile renewable energy sources (PV, Wind, etc.), a reduction in the use of fossil fuels, that destabilize the grid leading to black outs.
   The electricity grid is developing in a distributed network, so the connected energy markets are moving towards a new decentralized structure, where renewable sources and storage facilities (EVs), will have a significant penetration and adoption by energy customers, with the intent to provide sustainable solutions.[1]
   Balancing the demand and supply of electricity, in a system dominated by random elements, such as solar and wind production that depend on weather conditions, combined with the highly variable demand from domestic users, must lead to a new model of consumers and producers at the same time that is the so-called Prosumer and will be a challenge of great importance.
   With this paper we want to verify how the smart communities, made up of Prosumers, within smart cities, are the key to the new electricity distribution, based on ICT, IoT and smart metering. A significant contribution will be provided by the Blockchain to make the energy networks and related economic transactions secure and reliable.

AB The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm (PBFT) has been highly applied in consortium blockchain systems, however, this kind of consensus algorithm can hardly identify and remove faulty nodes in time, and also vulnerable to many attacks against the primary node of PBFT. The equality of consortium members' discourse rights is inapplicable to some real scenarios where dominating members are likely to have a larger discourse rights in the voting process.
   To address these problems, this paper presents Reputation based Byzantine Fault Tolerance (RBFT) algorithm that incorporates a reputation model to evaluate the operations of each node in the consensus process. The faulty nodes will get lower discourse rights in the voting process if any malicious behavior is detected, with their reputation decreased. Furthermore, this paper presents an innovative reputation-based primary change scheme. The node with higher reputation obtains greater opportunities to be a primary to generate new valid blocks, which reduces the security risk of the primary.
   The experimental results demonstrate that RBFT gains better performance and ensures system security and reliability. Compared with PBFT, it increases the average throughput by 15% and reduces delay by 10%, and the faulty node rate of the system can continue to decrease over time.

TI Art in the Age of Financial Crisis INTRODUCTION
SO VISUAL RESOURCES
AB This issue addresses the long financial crisis of 2008 and the nature and diversity of artistic responses to it. This financial crisis is understood as a globalized result of late capitalism that nonetheless is experienced differently at local, regional, and national levels. It is multi-faceted in nature, a phenomenon that has historical roots and precedents that inform contemporary responses. Artists are not restricted to engage with the economy through one specific vehicle of inquiry or one type of medium and message. Therefore, the central question that this issue poses is: what is the artist's role in finance, crisis, and the economy? Should artists: fix the economy; explain it; attempt to alter it; reject it; participate in it; or none of the above? The articles, artists' projects and interviews presented here attend to these questions through a wide-ranging lens including: studies of historical precedents such as the Great Depression of 1929 and currency crises in Latin America in the 1970s; artistic direct interventions within financial systems that reveal and challenge their opaque processes and value systems; alternative currencies highlighting the neo-colonialism of global financial markets; and blockchain-based rethinking of art market ownership models. These multi-faceted projects spanning different time periods and geographies offer crucial and distinct theoretical positions. This issue, which saw its origins in a panel for the 2017 College Art Association Conference in New York City, adds to scholarship on these pressing topics and seeks to foster a continued discourse on the intersections of art and financial crisis.

AB The existing credit systems are not well recognized because of separate brokerage systems, non pertinence, centralized and static evaluation models, and insufficient supporting information. An autonomous credit system is proposed to reform and address the issues of the current systems based on self-regulating blockchain data and programmable smart contracts. The autonomous credit system is trading-oriented to satisfy all the involved trading participants. A blockchain creditworthiness ecosystem is developed to implement the credit system as it provides an open, equal and creditworthy infrastructure. And it is through a collection of smart contracts that all the blockchain operations are processes. A creditworthiness model is developed to implement the credit system to be integrated, traceable, dynamic and personalized. Several pilot projects have been developed to test the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed autonomous credit system. Four creditworthiness clouds have been developed as public blockchain clients and creditworthiness lookup services.

AB With the increasing development and adoption of wearable devices, people care more about their health conditions than ever before. Both patients and doctors as well as insurance agencies benefit from this advanced technology. However, the emerging wearable devices creates a major concern over health data privacy as data collected from those devices can reflect patients' heath conditions and habits, and could increase the data disclosure risks among the healthcare providers and application vendors. In this paper, we propose using the trusted execution platform enabled by Intel SGX to provide accountability for data access and propose a decentralized approach with blockchain technology to address the privacy concern. By developing a web application for personal health data management (PHDM) systems, the individuals are capable of synchronizing sensor data from wearable devices with online account and controlling data access from any third parties. The protected personal health data and data access records are hashed and anchored to a permanent but secure ledger with platform dependency, ensuring data integrity and accountability. Analysis shows that our approach provides user privacy and accountability with acceptable overhead.

TI Blockchain Consensus Based User Access Strategies in D2D Networks for
   Data-Intensive Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A device-to-device (D2D) underlying cellular network is pervasive to support various wireless applications. However, due to the dramatic increase of data transmission in the network with limited amount of wireless resource, a few users may be required to temporarily disconnect from the network to avoid the interruption of data transmission in the whole network. A critical issue of determining the user access in D2D underlying networks is the authenticity of channel state information (CSI), and usually, a user with a higher CSI can be allocated a larger amount of wireless resource or have a higher probability of staying in the network. In this paper, we propose a blockchain consensus-based scheme to verify the authenticity of CSI and add the users who intentionally advocate a higher value of CSI into a fraud chain. Also, we consider both the cross-tier interference caused by a mobile user and the presence of a user in the fraud chain to determine the access of a user. The analysis results show that our proposed user access scheme can enhance the network performance by efficiently controlling the use access in mobile applications.

TI Phishing Detection with Image Retrieval Based on Improved Texton
   Correlation Descriptor
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Anti-detection is becoming as an emerging challenge for anti-phishing. This paper solves the threats of anti-detection from the threshold setting condition. Enough webpages are considered to complicate threshold setting condition when the threshold is settled. According to the common visual behavior which is easily attracted by the salient region of webpages, image retrieval methods based on texton correlation descriptor (TCD) are improved to obtain enough webpages which have similarity in the salient region for the images of webpages. There are two steps for improving TCD which has advantage of recognizing the salient region of images: (1) This paper proposed Weighted Euclidean Distance based on neighborhood location (NLW-Euclidean distance) and double cross windows, and combine them to solve the problems in TCD; (2) Space structure is introduced to map the image set to Euclid space so that similarity relation among images can be used to complicate threshold setting conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of anti-phishing and make the system more stable, and significantly reduce the possibilities of being hacked to be used as mining systems for blockchain.

AB The Ethereum ecosystem has created a prosperity of smart contract applications in public blockchains, with transparent, traceable and programmable transactions. However, the flexibility that everybody can write and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum causes a large collection of similar contracts, i.e., clones. In practice, smart contract clones may amplify severe threats like security attacks, resource waste etc..
   In this paper, we have developed ECLONE, a semantic clone detector for Ethereum. The key insight of our clone detection is Symbolic Transaction Sketch, i.e., a set of critical semantic properties generated from symbolic transaction. Sketches of two smart contracts will be normalized into numeric vectors with a same length. Then, the clone detection problem is modeled as a similarity computation process where sketches and other syntactic information are combined. We have applied ECLONE in identifying semantic clones of deployed Ethereum smart contracts and achieved an accuracy of 93.27%.

AB Blockchain is the underlying technology of Bitcoin. It is considered a prospect by industries such as finance, education and healthcare, due to its decentralization and non-tampering features. In the current Education-Industry cooperation, substantive information asymmetry exists between universities and employing companies. Student credit systems and the historical information data chain need urgent establishment and maintenance. The paper makes use of the transparency and non-tampering features of the blockchain system to implement an Education-Industry cooperative system based on the blockchain Hyperledger framework. Using the Certificate Authority service and transactions in the Hyperledger framework, the system simulates the roles of universities and companies in the system, and enables universities and enterprises to share information transparently, which achieves information symmetry among student skill and knowledge information, demands of enterprise recruitment, and current market trends. This offers a significant attempt on the application of blockchain technology to Education-Industry cooperation as a pilot development for technology deployment.

To alleviate the impact of current documentation exchange mechanisms on supply chain efficiency in the maritime industry, this study aims at presenting guidelines for leveraging blockchain technology as a solution for exchanging documentation in the shipping industry. We conduct semi-structured interviews with representatives from business, IT, and public institutions. This qualitative data is analyzed through a theoretical framework comprising transaction cost economics, diffusion of innovation and design theory. Based on the theoretical model and stakeholder analysis, a set of eight design principles are proposed for the successful implementation of blockchain. These are (1) Immutability, (2) Decentralization, (3) Security, (4) Privacy, (5) Compatibility, (6) Scalability, (7) Inclusiveness and (8) Territoriality. Furthermore, the study investigates four potential approaches for the implementation phase affecting the likelihood of adoption by industry stakeholders. The exploratory approach and generic framework provides the groundwork and inspiration for further research in supply chain management and the emerging field of blockchain technology.

AB Named Data Networking is built with security which requires each named Data object to be digitally signed by its producer. Thus, the NDN project has proposed a key management model on NDN testbed for verification of the Data packet to be immune to distributing poisoned content. However, in practice, this model poses two challenges for verifying fake content: (1) the centralized architecture easily leads to a single point of failure, especially when the root key fails, its difficult to verify the keys across sites due to the lack of trust between them, and (2) excessive overhead of certificate chain traversal when verifying signature. This paper first proposes a blockchain-based key management scheme in NDN to address the problem of lack of mutual trust between sites without trust anchors. Specifically, all site nodes form a permissioned blockchain for storing public key hashes to ensure the authenticity, and the proxy gateway participates in verifying to reduce excessively frequent communication between the router and the blockchain. In addition, the NDN public key content object and the scheme of their storage, verification, and revocation are redesigned. The result of our analysis and evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is capable of supporting less verification numbers and higher verification efficiency.

AB As a key technology that realises decentralised and highly trusted database management, Blockchain has recently attracted extensive attention. However, the high latency and low throughput in highly concurrent environments is the main performance bottleneck of Blockchain technology, and thus delays its deployment. Although multiple studies have been dedicated to solving the problem of low throughput in Blockchain, they only paid attention to the scenarios with large transactions volume while neglecting the issue of conflicting transactions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the conflict transactions will not only decrease the computing efficiency of Endorser but also slow down the performance of Hyperledger Fabric. Besides, we propose a Cache enhanced Endorser solution to tackle conflict transactions in Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. The experimental results show that our approach can reduce the workload of a node by up to 80%, shorten the turnaround time of transactions by 55%, and improve the computational performance of Endorser up to 1.9 times.

AB The public key infrastructure (PKI) based authentication protocol provides the basic security services for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). However, trust and privacy are still open issues due to the unique characteristics of vehicles. It is crucial for VANETs to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting forged messages while simultaneously protecting the privacy of each vehicle against tracking attacks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reputation system (BARS) to break the linkability between real identities and public keys to preserve privacy. The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently using two blockchains. We design a trust model to improve the trustworthiness of messages relying on the reputation of the sender based on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about the sender. Experiments are conducted to evaluate BARS in terms of security and performance and the results show that BARS is able to establish distributed trust management, while protecting the privacy of vehicles.

AB Blockchain can be the base for an evolution in several digital services. Fair Certified Notification is one of these and requires a fair exchange of values: a message and a non-repudiation of origin proof in exchange for a non-repudiation of reception evidence. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a blockchain-based Multiparty Fair Certified Notification system allowing the simultaneous fair notification to a set of receivers. We present and evaluate a smart contract for an optimistic multiparty protocol that achieves the properties of confidentiality, fairness and timeliness with a stateless TTP.

AB Blockchain-based distributed computing platforms enable the trusted execution of computation-defined in the form of smart contracts-without trusted agents. Smart contracts are envisioned to have a variety of applications, ranging from financial to IoT asset tracking. Unfortunately, the development of smart contracts has proven to be extremely error prone. In practice, contracts are riddled with security vulnerabilities comprising a critical issue since bugs are by design nonfixable and contracts may handle financial assets of significant value. To facilitate the development of secure smart contracts, we have created the FSolidM framework, which allows developers to define contracts as finite state machines (FSMs) with rigorous and clear semantics. FSolidM provides an easy-to-use graphical editor for specifying FSMs, a code generator for creating Ethereum smart contracts, and a set of plugins that developers may add to their FSMs to enhance security and functionality.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices present different security challenges that have not been addressed yet and there is no clear commitment from stakeholders to do so. Such problems have become evident and IoT devices are targets of malicious actors that employ them as instruments to fulfill their nefarious purposes. Recent attacks to major Internet services have shown the real damage vulnerable devices can make when compromised. Many of the endangered devices sit in home-based environments with users that are not familiar with security or network best practices, which make them easy targets for bad actors. Therefore, there exists the need to find practical solutions using existing technologies that have been, so far, proven to be efficient, such as the blockchain. This paper implements a proof of concept to secure consumer/home-based IoT devices and the networks around them using blockchain technology powered by Ethereum. The results obtained support the idea of a whitelisting application based on the Ethereum protocol.

TI Illicit payments for illicit goods: noncontact drug distribution on
   Russian online drug marketplaces
SO GLOBAL CRIME
AB The distribution or consumption of traditional drugs has become the subject of stringent penalties throughout most of the world and synthetic designer drugs have become the alternative. Novel psychoactive substances, also called 'legal highs', are highly varied in terms of chemical composition. These substances are advertised and distributed as an alternative to traditional drugs on the Internet, making identification of new substances and enforcement difficult. For this article, we downloaded and analysed 28 Russian-language online drug marketplaces which distribute traditional and novel psychoactive substances. All marketplaces used a noncontact drug dealing method where the seller and the buyer communicate through the Internet to arrange for payment and delivery of drugs without meeting face-to-face. Geographic information, price, amount, substance type and payment method data were extracted. Findings indicate such marketplaces are able to operate due to the ability of their clients to pay anonymously with the virtual currencies - Qiwi and Bitcoin.

AB Securities exchange being digitalised and online, security of information and data has become a major concern. Blockchain (BC) technology, being distributed and immutable in nature, has proved to the "Trust Machine" eliminating the need for third-parties. Authors of this paper investigate how Blockchain can be used to secure stock exchange transactions, with an especial focus to the technological as well as legal aspects of such applications. Considering the intricate operational structure of the securities exchange, the research proposes to design, develop and implement a hybrid BC, customised according to the need of the respective stock exchange. The study suggests that the use of such BC can bring many benefits which the other technologies currently being used cannot offer. However, during the design process of any such application using BC, the relevant laws and regulations of the corresponding country need to be considered.

AB Blockchain and smart contract technology provide a means of decentralised computational agreements that are trusted and automated. By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) devices with blockchain systems and smart contracts, agreements can not only be confined to in-blockchain manipulation of state, however can enable agreements to interact on the physical world. This integration is non-trivial due to the limited resources on IoT devices and the heterogeneity of such an architecture. Such blockchain connected IoT devices typically require programming of smart contracts, edge blockchain nodes and the IoT devices.
   IoT embedded systems require expertise in low level development. Similarly, smart contract programming requires expertise with an extensive attention to detail, as even minor bugs can have catastrophic consequences. In this paper, we propose a macroprogramming approach for developing the different system components required for blockchain connected IoT devices including smart contracts, edge nodes and IoT devices from a monolithic description. In this manner, one can use a higher level of abstraction to develop an application, while still being able to generate code automatically which can be deployed on different nodes.

AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger system based on P2P network and originally used for a crypto currency system. The P2P network of Blockchain is maintained by full nodes which are in charge of verifying all the transactions in the network. However, most Blockchain user nodes do not act as full nodes, because workload of full nodes is quite high for personal mobile devices. Blockchain search queries, such as confirming balance, transaction contents, and transaction histories, from many users go to the full nodes. As a result, search throughput of full nodes would be a new bottleneck of Blockchain system, because the number of full nodes is less than the number of users of Blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose an acceleration method of Blockchain search using GPUs. More specifically, we introduce an array-based Patricia tree structure suitable for GPU processing so that we can make effective use of Blockchain feature that there are no update and delete queries. In the evaluations, the proposed method is compared with an existing GPU-based key-value search and a conventional CPU-based search in terms of the throughput of Blockchain key search. As a result, the throughput of our proposal is 3.4 times higher than that of the existing GPU-based search and 14.1 times higher than that of the CPU search when the number of keys is 80 x 2(20) and the key length is 256-bit in Blockchain search queries.

AB Lots of traditional applications can be redefined thanks to the benefits of Blockchain technologies. One of these services is the provision of fair certified notifications. Certified notifications is one of the applications that require a fair exchange of values: a message and a non-repudiation of origin proof in exchange for a non-repudiation of reception evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first blockchain-based certified notification system. We propose two solutions that allow sending certified notifications when confidentiality is required or when it is necessary to register the content of the notification, respectively. First, we present a protocol for Non Confidential Fair Certified Notifications that satisfies the properties of strong fairness and transferability of the proofs thanks to the use of a smart contract and without the need of a Trusted Third Party. Then, we also present a DApp for Confidential Certified Notifications with a smart contract that allows a timeliness optimistic exchange of values with a stateless Trusted Third Party.

AB Distributed ledgers (e.g. blockchains) enable financial institutions to efficiently reconcile cross-organization transactions. For example, banks might use a distributed ledger as a settlement log for digital assets. Unfortunately, these ledgers are either entirely public to all participants, revealing sensitive strategy and trading information, or are private but do not support third-party auditing without revealing the contents of transactions to the auditor. Auditing and financial oversight are critical to proving institutions are complying with regulation.
   This paper presents zkLedger, the first system to protect ledger participants' privacy and provide fast, provably correct auditing. Banks create digital asset transactions that are visible only to the organizations party to the transaction, but are publicly verifiable. An auditor sends queries to banks, for example "What is the outstanding amount of a certain digital asset on your balance sheet?" and gets a response and cryptographic assurance that the response is correct. zkLedger has two important benefits over previous work. First, zkLedger provides fast, rich auditing with a new proof scheme using Schnorr-type non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Unlike zk-SNARKs, our techniques do not require trusted setup and only rely on widely-used cryptographic assumptions. Second, zkLedger provides completeness; it uses a columnar ledger construction so that banks cannot hide transactions from the auditor, and participants can use rolling caches to produce and verify answers quickly. We implement a distributed version of zkLedger that can produce provably-correct answers to auditor queries on a ledger with a hundred thousand transactions in less than 10 milliseconds.

AB While blockchains and smart contracts are primarily known for their use as the technologies underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, these technologies also have applicability in other areas. In this paper, we present an application of smart contracts running on a permissioned distributed ledger (essentially a private blockchain where only credentialed participants are allowed to read and write) to managing tenant and service accounts in a cloud computing data center. The system is called Saranyu and it supports four services: identity management, authentication, authorization, and charging. Identity management and authentication are handled using client-generated public/private key pairs in the usual fashion. Authorization is handled as a contract from a grantee of service access rights to a recipient which is a tenant or other service. Charging is supported by Saranyu integration with payment gateways for payments related to service resource usage. We describe an implementation of Saranyu on top of the Quorum blockchain system. We believe the security, non-repudiation, tamper-resistance, and easy transaction history access brought by blockchain technology will increase transparency and trust in cloud tenant and service management and that the fundamentally distributed nature of the blockchain will make Saranyu an excellent match with developing distributed cloud architectures.

TI Digital registry of professional competences of the population drawing

SO BIZNES INFORMATIKA-BUSINESS INFORMATICS
AB At a time when the digital economy is emerging, the preservation and multiplication of intellectual capital, which is currently a key factor in social development, are paramount. The national economy's orientation toward the use of modern achievements of the digital industry will contribute to a faster transition to the global information society. Digitalization of education will make it possible to use the latest scientific achievements for the development of other areas of life in society.
   This study presents a model that applies distributed registry technologies based on blockchains and smart contracts for the reliable storage and efficient use of date relating to the population's professional competencies. This model aims to create a unified information environment for interaction between all the actors of the economic system. The authors developed the model for registering professional competencies of the population and their developmental paths based on modem digital technologies. We substantiate the efficiency and security assured by blockchain technology for information storage and transmission. Educational institutions of all levels, governmental authorities controlling education, and people taking part in the educational process are the basic actors of the system presented.
   The proposed model presents the educational level and professional skills of each registered person as an education index (ED, which keeps track of all educational achievements and professional competencies of the participant over their lifetime. When calculating the EI , the authors also propose to consider ratings of the educational institutions responsible for the participant's professional skills. The implementation of the EI will significantly simplify the process of employing graduates from various educational institutions, as well as the college admissions process. In addition, analytic tools could be used to create ratings of colleges, school departments, and even specific teachers. The registry of professional competencies we developed is directed at the processing and storage of large volumes of data (Big Data). In the future, this will allow us to open access to the registry to employers, pension insurance funds, and other state authorities that require complete and reliable personal data.

TI Case study of Lykke exchange: architecture and outlook
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose This paper aims to explain the architecture and design choices of the exchange. Lykke is a FinTech company based in Zurich that has launched the global marketplace for all asset classes and instruments digitized on the blockchain. The authors discuss how the exchange will evolve over time. They explore the macroeconomic benefits of the new blockchain technology. The Lykke exchange is compatible with any type of public blockchain.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors present the architecture of an exchange for colored coins. By colored coins, they mean issuer-backed securities on the Bitcoin blockchain. Orders are collected and matched by a semi-trusted exchange. Matched orders are settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, where each successful trade between parties appears as a set atomic-colored coins swap transactions. Unfilled and expired orders are discarded. The exchange does not take possession of the traded coins, but needs to be trusted to match trades correctly.
   Findings Lykke has launched the exchange initially for the main currencies, cryptocurrencies and Lykke coin (entitlement to the shares of Lykke company). Perspective asset classes include futures and options on digital assets, crowd-funded loans for retail and private equity financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, contracts for difference, zero coupon bonds and other fixed income and natural capital bonds.
   Originality/value Lykke exchange and all its tools and services are open source; the transparency of technology is ideal for research. The paper provides a high-level overview of the exchange and concludes with a research agenda.

This framework is based on the emerging technology Blockchain whose potential is approved in the matter of transparency, reliability, security and availability without resorting to a central processing unit judged of trust. ANDROSCANREG consists of two Blockchains, the first one (PERMBC) will handle analysis, validation and preparation of the raw results so that they will persist in the second Blockchain of Bitcoin already existing (BTCBC), which will assume the role of a Registry of recovered permissions and will save the permissions history of each version of the applications being scanned via financial transactions, whose wallet source, recipient wallet and transaction value have a precise meaning. An example of a simulation will be presented to describe the different steps, actors, interactions and messages generated by the different entity of ANDROSCANREG.

AB Today, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are the powerhouse of data generation with their ever-increasing numbers and widespread penetration. Similarly, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) solutions are getting integrated to all kinds of services, making products significantly more "smarter". The centerpiece of these technologies is "data". IoT device vendors should be able keep up with the increased throughput and come up with new business models. On the other hand, AI/ML solutions will produce better results if training data is diverse and plentiful.
   In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based, decentralized and trustless data marketplace where IoT device vendors and AI/ML solution providers may interact and collaborate. By facilitating a transparent data exchange platform, access to consented data will be democratized and the variety of services targeting end-users will increase. Proposed data marketplace is implemented as a smart contract on Ethereum blockchain and Swarm is used as the distributed storage platform.

AB The Bitcoin protocol is a significant milestone in the history of money. However, its adoption is currently constrained by the transaction limits of the system. As the chief problem of block chain technology, the scaling issue has attracted many valuable solutions both on-chain and off-chain.
   In this paper, our goal is to explore the notion of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to propose an augmented Bitcoin protocol that can scale gracefully. Our proposal aims to increase the transaction throughput by partitioning the UTXO space and splitting the block chain. In addition, a new type of Bitcoin node is introduced to preserve the capability to run validating nodes in low-bandwidth environments, despite the increased transaction throughput.

AB There has been increased interest in the use of blockchains to control Internet of Things devices either directly, or through smart contracts. Many blockchains, such as Ethereum and Fabric, have support for smart contracts. The use of public blockchains while attractive due to their decentralization and availability, do pose challenges, such as unpredictable transaction latencies and cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Transactions in the Ethereum network, such as invokations of smart contracts used to control an IoT device, have no fairness or eventuality guarantees. In this work we describe a "spam attack" method available to parties with sufficient cryptocurrency reserves to delay a statistically significant portion of transactions submitted to the Ethereum network. This paper derives estimations on the costs and effects of such an attack, and is based on an analysis of historical transactions.

AB Blockchains have revolutionized the storage of data in an immutable, transparent and non-centralized way. However, public blockchain systems like the Bitcoin system face a problem of scalability, primarily due to the significant and growing size of its blockchain. This paper introduces a method, termed block summarization, which reduces blockchain storage overhead for systems having transferable transactions. The proposed method allows resource-restricted light nodes to store a form of the blockchain such that it can validate the transactions independently which ultimately reduce dependency on full nodes. This way, we can achieve a middle ground between Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) nodes which can only verify the membership of a transaction in the blockchain, and full nodes with pruning enabled which can only support pruning provided they have an infrastructure of full nodes. We implemented our algorithm for a custom blockchain using Bitcoin blocks and were able to achieve a compression ratio of 0.54.

AB An increasing number of people, organizations and corporations are expressing their interest in the decentralization technology of the blockchain. The creation of the blockchain marks the time when we start building distributed peer-to-peer networks consisting of non-trusting members that interact with each other without a trusted intermediary but in a verifiable manner. In this paper, we propose a decentralized application (DApp) based on blockchain technology for sharing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors' data, and demonstrate various challenges addressed during the development process. This application combines blockchain technology with IoT and operates through smart contracts that are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. More specifically the application is a platform for sharing (buying and selling) measurements of IoT weather sensors and operates on the Ethereum blockchain, acting as a marketplace for IoT sensor data. This application applies the Sensing-as-a-Service (S2aaS) business model combined with blockchain.

AB We present a healthcare remedy evaluation system, called CORUS, using blockchain-based crowdsourcing on a cloud computing platform. Efficacy of healthcare remedies such as functional foods and dietary supplements usually spreads by subjective word of mouth. Though regular clinical trials could be employed, it requires significant cost in time and budget. We expect crowdsourcing can be an effective and efficient alternative to the costly clinical trials to achieve objective evaluation on healthcare remedies. The blockchain technology can alleviate the problem of information quality in most of crowdsourcing systems. Properly designed reward distribution schemes can motivate voluntary participants to provide with credible information. The distributed replication of blockchains can increase the information credibility by prohibiting malicious forgery. We also utilize the Amazon cloud system to enhance availability and scalability. To our knowledge, CORUS is the first system to utilize crowdsourcing, blockchains, and cloud computing for healthcare remedy evaluation. It is available at https://corus.kaist.edu.

AB Industry 4.0 will enable the development of hyper-efficient plants, which facilitate the implementation of emerging production models such as Made-to-Order and Configure-to-Order. In this direction, the H2020 FAR-EDGE project has introduced a reference architecture and an accompanying platform that facilitates the implementation of digital automation solutions based on edge computing and distributed ledger technologies, which enable fast, reliable and responsive automation. In this paper, we illustrate the use of these technologies for the implementation and deployment of a practical use case in the white appliances industry. Specifically, we present how a sorter component can be automatically programmed in order to ensure that items arriving at a conveyor are optimally placed in various bays. The use case leverages the edge computing paradigm in order to ensure that each physical item is able to communicate its status to all the others. At the same time, distributed ledger technologies enable the modelling of the sorting process as a reliable smart contract among all physical entities. The benefits of the deployment include tangible improvements in productivity, along with a significant reduction in the effort and time needed for the reconfiguration of the sorter.

AB Aggregate Computing is a promising paradigm for coordinating large numbers of possibly situated devices, typical of scenarios related to the Internet of Things, smart cities, drone coordination, and mass urban events. Currently, little work has been devoted to study and improve security in aggregate programs, and existing works focus solely on application-level countermeasures. Those security systems work under the assumption that the underlying computational model is respected; however, so-called Byzantine behaviour violates such assumption. In this paper, we discuss how Byzantine behaviours can hinder an aggregate program, and exploit application-level protection for creating bigger disruption. We discuss how the blockchain technology can mitigate these attacks by enforcing behaviours consistent with the expected operational semantics, with no impact on the application logic.

AB Traditional blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin, focus on transactions in which entire amount is transferred from one owner to the other, in a single, atomic operation. This model has been re-used in the context of payment networks such as Lightning network. In this work, we propose and investigate new payment model, called split payments, in which the total amount to be transferred is split into unit-amounts and is transferred independently through the same or different routes. By splitting the payments this way, we achieve an improved total liquidity of the payment network, simplify the route advertising, reduce the amount of funds needed to be locked in the channels, and improve the privacy properties.

AB Information technology services have undergone a revolution in the last decade, as the demand for services like cloud storage, mobile applications, portable electronics and high speed data are exponentially increasing. As we move towards a data-centric environment, it is of paramount importance that the security provided should intercept and block all possible threats. These security threats are continually evolving to circumvent the immediate countermeasures implemented. In addition to the existing type of malicious computer programs like virus, Trojans, and worms, a new malware called as ransomware is spawning across the computing world for gaining monetary compensation. Presently, numerous types of ransomware are infecting personal and commercial internet users globally. The ransomware is a type of malware that enters into a host machine via a malicious email, link or executable program. This malware encrypts critical user data, and the only way to recover the data is by paying a ransom using a cryptocurrency. This paper will focus on learning the intricate working of crypto locker ransomware using asymmetric encryption and Software Defined Networking. The time taken for encryption of files will be observed for different data sizes and methods will be proposed to mitigate the threat.

SO PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI
AB The article is devoted to the definition of the legal nature and limits of the legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies, including the creation of crypto-currencies using them. The interest of the authors of the article is related to the law enforcement requirement and the simultaneous uncertainty of the use of new categories for the Russian state that are of primary importance for its development in the conditions of the development of the digital economy. The aim is to determine the boundaries and objectives of legal regulation of Fintekh and Regtekh; to identify on the basis of scientific analysis the legal essence of these concepts, as well as related categories. The methods used are formal-logical, comparison, analysis, synthesis, comparison, generalization. The results are analysis of the current situation on the use and regulation of financial and regulatory technologies in the Russian Federation, as well as the approaches to determining their legal nature; identification of risks in the application of financial and regulatory technologies, formulating proposals for their prevention and leveling; identification of stages and main directions of legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies in the Russian Federation; analysis of foreign experience in the legal regulation of financial and regulatory technologies, including in the field of taxation; formulation of proposals for the taxation of certain elements of Fintekh and Regtekh in the Russian Federation. The conclusion is that the state determined the need for legal regulation and identified the main vectors of the movement in the legal field. National legal regulation is at the stage of origin; at present, attempts are made to legalize key concepts in the financial and regulatory technologies market (digital financial asset, digital transaction, digital entry, digital transactions register, mining, crypto currency, token, smart contract, etc.). It is noted that the key objectives of the legal regulation should be the minimization of risks for the financial system of the state and national security, as well as replenishment of the revenue side of the budget through taxation of services rendered on the market of financial services and Regtekh, including taxation of operations with crypto currencies and tokens.

AB Blockchain technology combined with IoT to improve the reliability of the supply chain system is one of the topics in great demand lately. Due to the nature of blockchain, it is suitable to be applied in the supply chain to improve the level of service with security guarantees. In this paper, we present a preliminary study of blockchain in the supply chain using Ethereum smart contract to maintain ownership of digital assets and to track the origin of a product. By leveraging the proposed model, the user can be protected by minimizing the fake online trading activity because product assets that have been recorded by blockchain can be guaranteed since the data cannot be changed by anyone (tamper-proof). Further research needs to be developed, especially the connection between IoT devices and the blockchain network to improve the reliability and effectiveness of the decentralized supply chain system.

TI A Blockchain-Based Contractual Routing Protocol for the Internet of
   Things Using Smart Contracts
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based contractual routing (BCR) protocol for a network of untrusted IoT devices. In contrast to conventional secure routing protocols in which a central authority (CA) is required to facilitate the identification and authentication of each device, the BCR protocol operates in a distributed manner with no CA. The BCR protocol utilizes smart contracts to discover a route to a destination or data gateway within heterogeneous IoT networks. Any intermediary device can guarantee a route from a source IoT device to a destination device or gateway. We compare the performance of BCR with that of the Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol in a network of 14 devices. The results show that the routing overhead of the BCR protocol is 5 times lower compared to AODV at the cost of a slightly lower packet delivery ratio. BCR is fairly resistant to both Blackhole and (keyhole attacks. The results show that the BCR protocol enables distributed routing in heterogeneous IoT networks.

AB Outsourcing a computation has been a major research area in cryptography. A delegator (D) outsources a computation to a worker (W), who expects to get paid in return for delivering correct outputs. The delegator has to verify the output returned, to guard against malicious or malfunctioning worker. The worker may not trust the delegator to pay for computations performed by him. Blockchain systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer public verifiability of transactions generated in their networks. These transactions are of the form of a set of opcodes in Bitcoins or initiate execution of a contract in Ethereum, thus offering execution of small programs publicly. A fair protocol for verifiable computation between two parties D and W must provide the following guarantee: (1) Fast verification: The work performed to verify the correctness of output of a function is less than the work performed to compute function. (2) Pay to learn output: W obtains pay from D iff D received the correct output of the computation from W.
   In this work, we design two ideal functionalities F*(CRR) for single worker case and F*(CCRR) for multiple workers case. Existing methods do not allow Mutual revocation of deposit transaction which reduces the cost of script execution. Our ideal functionalities offer mutual revocation of the deposit transaction made by D. We show the realization of our ideal functionality F*(CRR) in Bitcoin, and we also discuss fair protocols for verifiable computations of GCD of two large numbers and optimization problems. As our final work, we show a fair protocol for proofbased verifiable computing schemes.

AB Blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have seen significant adoption in the past few years and show promise to design applications without any centralized reliance on third parties. In this paper, we present Endolith, an auditing framework for verifying file integrity and tracking file history without third party reliance using a smart contract-based blockchain. Annotated files are continuously monitored and metadata about changes including file hashes are stored tamper-proof on the blockchain. Based on this, Endolith can prove that a file stored a long time ago has not been changed without authorization or, if it did, track when it has changed, by whom. Endolith implementation is based on Ethereum and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Our evaluation on a public blockchain network shows that Endolith is efficient for files that are infrequently modified but often accessed, which are common characteristics of data archives.

Examples include: advanced manufacturing of embedded sensors with energy harvesting capability; wireless signal transmission and blockchain infrastructure; and the application of data analytics and machine learning to processing distributed sensor signals to create actionable control interfaces. The fossil energy application space requires the development of sensors capable of monitoring key operational parameters (temperature, pressure, and gas compositions) while operating in harsh environments; analytical sensors capable of on-line, real-time evaluation and measurement to support condition-based monitoring. Controls development centers around self-organizing information networks, algorithms for component lifetime assessment and plant-level economics, and distributed intelligence for process control and decision making All of this must be accomplished while hardening fossil energy assets.

SO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: PLATFORMS, TOOLS AND USE CASES
SE Advances in Computers
AB Bitcoin paved the way for a highly successful FinTech (Financial Technology) application on the basis of a newer technology termed blockchain. As this technology has evolved very recently beyond the financial market, gaining more public attention, other promising blockchain applications areas and use cases are emerging. However, it is still not a straightforward in which application areas and use cases blockchains do provide an advantage beyond distributed databases and decentralized systems. Through a decentralized and immutable data storage blockchains enable the enforcement and verification of exchange assets, while disrupting potentially existing business models by promoting the disintermediation of processes involving multiple stakeholders. While having no mediator or a third party controlling the operation, less operational costs and a higher business agility are targeted at. However, the adoption of blockchains requires not only overcoming its technical challenges, but it also implies to reach the ability to understand and handle the impact on existing business models, processes, and legal compliances. This chapter will overview the main blockchain application areas by providing examples and by discussing from the technical perspective on how and under which conditions the use of blockchains can be useful for a successful use case.

AB The set of distributed ledger architectures known as blockchain is best known for cryptocurrency applications such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. These permissionless block chains are showing the potential to be disruptive to the financial services industry. Their broader adoption is likely to be limited by the maximum block size, the cost of the Proof of Work consensus mechanism, and the increasing size of any given chain overwhelming most of the participating nodes. These factors have led to many cryptocurrency blockchains to become centralized in the nodes with enough computing power and storage to be a dominant miner and validator. Permissioned chains operate in trusted environments and can, therefore, avoid the computationally expensive consensus mechanisms. Permissioned chains are still susceptible to asset storage demands and non-standard user interfaces that will impede their adoption. This paper describes an approach to addressing these limitations: permissioned blockchain that uses off-chain storage of the data assets and this is accessed through a standard browser and mobile app. The implementation in the Hyperledger framework is described as is an example use of patient-centered health data management.

AB In order to ensure faster audits, higher transparency and security, many applications are being designed using blockchains. We propose BlockStore, a decentralized storage framework using blockchain technology. The primary motivation is efficient utilization of storage resources of users. Users often have un-utilized or underutilized storage in their devices. They can choose to host their storage resources when they are not in use. Users rent storage from the host for a fee for a fixed period of time and release back after the time expires. BlockStore keeps track of un-utilized storage of hosts in Space Wallet, a structure that helps in assigning storage to renters on request. The ownership of storage can be proved by logging all storage transactions in a public ledger (the blockchain), which can be verified by any user. A host cannot host the same storage to two users at the same time, nor can it tamper with the data of the renter. Renters cannot frame a host of cheating. BlockStore uses proofs of storage and data possession to verify that the hosts do not tamper with data and penalizes parties for misbehavior. Users can encrypt data for privacy. Payment and penalty are handled using smart contracts. BlockStore differs from existing solutions, by providing stronger audit that detects and penalizes misbehaving parties earlier than existing schemes.

AB From its early days the Internet of Things (IoT) has evolved into a decentralized system of cooperating smart objects with the requirement, among others, of achieving distributed consensus. Yet, current IoT platform solutions are centralized cloud based computing infrastructures, manifesting a number of significant disadvantages, such as, among others, high cloud server maintenance costs, weakness for supporting time-critical IoT applications, security and trust issues. Enabling blockchain technology into IoT can help to achieve a proper distributed consensus based IoT system that overcomes those disadvantages. While this is an ideal match, it is still a challenging endeavor. In this paper we take a first step towards that goal by designing Hybrid-IoT, a hybrid blockchain architecture for IoT. In Hybrid-IoT, subgroups of IoT devices form PoW blockchains, referred to as PoW sub-blockchains. Then, the connection among the PoW sub-blockchains employs a BFT inter-connector framework, such as Polkadot or Cosmos. In this paper, we focus on the PoW sub-blockchains formation, guided by a set of guidelines based on a set of dimensions, metrics and bounds. In order to prove the validity of the approach we carry on a performance and security evaluation.

AB Blockchain is core technology for cryptocurrency and it is possible to become fundamental platform for industry and business. Especially, a blockchain-based digital asset transfer system using Internet of Things (IoT) products has recently been considered as a new practical platform, but the protocol limits performance. Previous research has improved performance by proposing new protocols, but further improvement is necessary for dealing with increasing transactions via IoT products. Therefore, we propose an in-Network Interface Card (in-NIC) processing approach using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to improve performance of a blockchain-based transfer system. To be more concrete, we design and implement a prototype NIC with a key-value data store written in a P4 language on the FPGA that has four 10Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) network interfaces. The prototype system supports frequently-used commands (CREATE, ISSUE, TRANSFER and REFER) for transferring digital asset. It reduces time for processing a kernel network protocol stack and accessing the data store. In fact, we measured throughput and latency of our prototype system compared to those of a blockchain software application. As a result, we found that our solution is able to obtain throughput 6.04 times higher on average and latency 15.4 times lower on average for all typical blockchain operations.

AB Recently, despite the growing popularity of smart contracts, one serious concern is arising among both industry and academia, that is, whether they work autonomously without human intervention really as intended and, when we are not sure, how we can ensure that contracts meet particular requirements. To resolve this, we propose a new formal approach to smart contract development: instead of defining contracts just as programs in conventional languages, they should be defined using formal logic so that we can verify whether they meet particular requirements and enforce them if necessary. The primary challenge is that expressive formal logic often turns out to be undecidable and consequently executable programs cannot be generated. As a solution, each contract definition is divided into two layers, namely specification layer in a decidable logic called Linear Dynamic Logic for verification and enforcement of requirements and rule layer for defining implementation details, while the consistency between the two layers is systematically guaranteed. Based on this, it also becomes possible to automatically generate executable contract programs from their formal specification, which leads to improving the trustworthiness of contracts. Evaluation on Hyperledger Fabric shows the feasibility and high effectiveness of our approach.

AB This paper describes the proof of concept of a blockchain based organization of a local low voltage energy community. The focus of the concept is efficient use of shared resources to minimize external dependence, and not energy trading. A previously proposed control algorithm, which exploits the power dependency of the efficiency of electrical energy storages, is implemented as a smart contract on a private instance of an Ethereum blockchain to coordinate the operation. It is implemented using four connected Raspberry Pis representing the participating households with pre-given electrical load and photovoltaic conversion as well as a battery. Each household runs an Ethereum full node and an interfacing software. Only the energy technology components are simulated, while the blockchain is actually running on the Raspberry Pis in order to mind the full complexity of the technology. The practicability is proved in a test run and positive effects on the efficiency and the self-sufficiency within the community are observed. A first cost-benefit estimate is given and a further research agenda is presented.

AB Many parallel SystemC approaches expect a thread safe and conflict free model from the designer. Alternatively, an advanced compiler can identify and avoid possible parallel access conflicts. While manual conflict resolution can theoretically be more precise, it is impractical for real world applications because of the inherent complexities. Here automatic compiler based analysis is preferred which provides conservative conflict avoidance with minimal false positives. This paper introduces a novel compiler technique called Port Call Path analysis that greatly reduces the amount of false positive conflicts resulting in significantly increased simulation speed. Experimental results show that the new analysis reduces the amount of false conflicts by up to 98% and, on a 4-core processor, speeds up the simulation up to 3x for a NoC particle simulator and 3.5x for a bitcoin miner SystemC model.

AB This position paper describes how blockchains facilitate the implementation of distributed self-adaptive systems. We demonstrate how the master/slave decentralised control pattern for self-adaptive systems, integrated with a permissioned blockchain, can protect nodes of a network against attacks by continuously adapting the membership of an access control list. Whenever malicious behaviour is detected, consensus on an updated access control list is reached, and that node is removed from the network. Using a smart home, as an example, we demonstrate that a permissioned blockchain is able to maintain a consistent view of a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the presence of malicious nodes.

AB Fog Computing, Augmented Reality (AR) and Blockchain are technologies that have been receiving more attention in recent years. Fog Computing for on-site data analysis and Blockchain as a decentralized framework are used to establish security and trust. AR enables new interactive scenarios with devices in the industrial environment and provides user interfaces for devices that had previously lacked one. The combination of these technologies in an industrial environment opens up new possibilities and opportunities. We present the IIoT Bazaar, a decentralized marketplace for industrial edge applications that relies on Blockchain to create transparency for all stakeholders involved and to enable the traceability of app installations on edge devices. With Fog Computing, resource-limited edge devices can be integrated into the IIoT Bazaar ecosystem. Fog Nodes enable the provisioning of applications on edge devices and their integration into a decentralized Blockchain network. AR serves as an interface between the users and the machines, allowing people to interact intuitively with the edge devices. With a case study, we demonstrate the design and prototypical implementation of the IIoT Bazaar and its applications which bring software developers and users together using a combination of Fog Computing, AR, and Blockchain. We share the challenges we faced and our experiences we made during the case study.

TI Efficiency or speculation? A dynamic analysis of the Bitcoin market
SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB Bitcoin has recently been labelled as a "dangerous speculative bubble" by Nobel Prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Shiller, as the Bitcoin's market value now exceeds the GDP of over 130 countries. In this study, the multifractality and efficiency of the Bitcoin price index are tested, using a nonlinear data analysis technique called the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). In addition, we assess the time-variations in the market efficiency level through using a rolling-window framework. Our evidence shows that the efficiency of the Bitcoin market changes over time and this market seems to be more efficient during downward than upward periods. We also find that Bitcoin is marked by a persistent long memory phenomenon in its short- term components, which could be interpreted as a possible speculation by investors.

AB Development of secure methods for storing log files is of tremendous importance for cyber security. One of the first actions by a hacker upon penetrating a machine is editing the log files to remove evidence of their presence. We propose to improve the security of these log files through a blockchain based solution. We show how our solution can be used to help organizations to mutually protect their sensitive log data even if some of them are compromised. Our solution allows data confidentiality between the collaborative parties.

AB The students' online quiz is a way to realize the informatization and modernization of higher education. To solve the problem that the scoring process is non-transparent, injustice and the final results are easy to be changed, an online quiz scheme based on Double-layer Consortium Blockchain is proposed. The scheme achieves the public verification of students' answers and the answer records cannot be tampered with but can be traced. Besides, group signature is used to solve the problem of anonymous abuse in blockchain applications. In addition, the storage pressure of sub-chains' nodes can be further reduced by adding the prime-chain's index to the sub-chains.

AB One of the biggest problems plaguing society today is that of fraudulent elections. The world's largest democracies still suffer from flawed electoral systems. In current voting systems, we see problems with vote rigging, hacking of the EVM (Electronic voting machine), election manipulation, and polling booth capturing. Looking closely at the current Cambridge Analytica scandal brings the validity of current voting systems into question. In this paper, we propose a novel voting model which can resolve these issues. Using a recently introduced blockchain protocol called PHANTOM, we try to alleviate known problems in voting systems. Furthermore, the advantage of using our model is, it is compatible with all voting schemes. So, one can implement our model using any voting scheme depending on the requirement of different type of elections.

AB Large files cannot be efficiently stored on blockchains. On one hand side, the blockchain becomes bloated with data that has to be propagated within the blockchain network. On the other hand, since the blockchain is replicated on many nodes, a lot of storage space is required without serving an immediate purpose, especially if the node operator does not need to view every file that is stored on the blockchain. It furthermore leads to an increase in the price of operating blockchain nodes because more data needs to be processed, transferred and stored. IPFS is a file sharing system that can be leveraged to more efficiently store and share large files. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain. Nonetheless, IPFS does not permit users to share files with selected parties. This is necessary, if sensitive or personal data needs to be shared. Therefore, this paper presents a modified version of the InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS) that leverages Ethereum smart contracts to provide access controlled file sharing. The smart contract is used to maintain the access control list, while the modified IPFS software enforces it. For this, it interacts with the smart contract whenever a file is uploaded, downloaded or transferred. Using an experimental setup, the impact of the access controlled IPFS is analyzed and discussed.

TI LEGAL VIEW ON THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES
SO RUSSIAN LAW JOURNAL
AB According to the Concept of Long-Term Social and Economic Development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2020, in the next few years the imbalance in world trade, as well as capital flows, will continue to increase, which will lead to changes in foreign exchange rates. That is why the final goal is to promote priority national interests in the framework of bilateral and multilateral trade and economic relations with foreign countries. In pursuit of this goal, the following improvement of customs regulation, and export and currency control mechanisms in the Russian Federation will be aimed at reducing barriers to foreign economic activity of innovative enterprises. Achievement of the set goals today is subject to the influence of a constantly changing world and new technologies. New technologies are increasingly penetrating the life of modern society. Meanwhile, the speed of introduction of new technologies is such that point changes in current legislation will gradually nullify the effectiveness of legal regulation as a system. Therefore, the changes today should concern not only the monetary and financial sphere, but also take into account other areas. The article is devoted to the study of crucial problems of implementing modern technologies from the legal point of view. Thus, at the international level, uncertainty still remains over issues of currency and legal responsibility, which is largely due to various legal regulations. Starting in 2018, the new rules for calculating the liquidity of banks and the ratio of borrowed funds to assets will come into full force in the European Union. Several large banks in France, dissatisfied with the policy of the European Central Bank (ECB), even appealed to the European Court of Justice for a change in the rules. According to FxPro analysts' reports, economic growth in Europe has accelerated slightly, and the ECB is on the verge of abandoning its ultra-easy monetary policy in the direction of neutral and is preparing for further tightening. One of the subjects of the research is the system of monetary relations from the point of view of analyzing the problems of ensuring its stability, including criminal and legal means. The purpose of this analysis is to illustrate how to protect the domestic foreign exchange market and the challenges facing the monetary system today. The article has been prepared on the basis of legal and technical analysis of legal norms, as well as comparative legal and formal logical methods and system analysis methodology. In the authors' view, this could contribute to a uniform approach to the problem, without which it would be extremely difficult to achieve success. It is concluded that in view of new challenges facing the global economy and the emergence of cryptocurrency, it is necessary to rethink the phenomenon of currency crimes, to study the experience of combating monetary crimes in other countries and to evaluate the common mechanisms for combating currency crimes. However, this approach cannot be considered legitimate insofar as different interpretation of the same term in different branches of legislation does not allow full realization of the constitutional rights and freedoms of citizens. After all, branches of legislation do not exist in isolation from one another, but are interrelated.
   It is concluded that the person conducting proceedings in a case can and is obliged, based on an analysis of the circumstances under consideration, to proceed from a comprehensive assessment of the category used in making the decision as applied to its understanding in aggregate in various branches of legislation. It is also necessary to create a universal state database for judges, prosecutors, investigators, etc., which would allow free cross-sectoral information exchange on the same subject. The new digital economy also requires retraining of civil servants and state employees, including the judiciary branch of government. At the same time, the article deals with the transformation of the legal profession in the future. It is concluded that classical legal education will not sink into oblivion. However, the lawyers of the future will play a slightly different role, namely, they will act as machinists, builders, operators and inventors of a useful model of legal relations for robot judges.

AB Application of IoT (Internet of Things) is expanding rapidly as internet connects things in our homes and our personal devices and even our body, provides ease, entertainment and comfort to our daily lives. However, as everything personal is connected, security and privacy becomes a major challenge. Blockchain-based IoT can provide a completely trusted and transparent environment with its tamper-resistant data structure, timestamp, data encryption and distributed consensus. Since cryptocurrency is the first application of blockchains, most blockchain mechanisms like Ethereum provides token-based peer-to-peer payment system that allows payment using a custom currency which enables IoT devices to pay or receive token without a third-party inclusion. In this paper we proposed to apply blockchain mechanism to education/discipline of children at home by through token-based parental control in which parent can encourage good behaviors and discourage bad behaviors of children via tokens transferred via blockchain network. Current parental control is implemented in operating systems of smartphones that only prohibits the abuse of smartphone games or inappropriate web sites. However, this token-based parental control pay tokens to children with good behaviors that allow them to play or watch the proper contents as their rewards. Devices at home like television and computer are connected to the blockchain and accessible only when the user have a sufficient amount of tokens. Children are given incentives in term of token by their parents if they do their homework properly or help their parents. Besides that, smart contract feature in Ethereum allows application to be programmed in a blockchain enables monitoring the activities of children through blockchain. This paper introduces the design of the token-based parental control by using smart contract schemes of Ethereum blockchain with a simple smart home setup as a proof of concept.

AB A classic legal problem is whether breach of contract may give rise to a remedy. Under common law this is discussed under the doctrine of excuses. Its civil lawequivalent is the attributability of causes of non-performance of an obligation, and its converse, force majeure. Despite the variety of approaches in various jurisdictions, the general outlines are roughly equivalent as far as translation into smart contracts is concerned: the main issue is what is the cause of non-performance and whether this cause can be attributed.

And patients have no control over medical information at the time of treatment. For this reason, this paper proposes a method of secure sharing of medical images based on smart contracts of block chain and credit scores. Through a blockchain based on distributed, reliable database of recording image sharing process, we realize a cross-organizational, cross-regional, trustworthy, and supervisory medical image sharing system. And the establishment of smart contracts based on credit scores of patients and medical institutions guarantee intelligent sharing by rules and conditions. Compared with traditional PACS, the method proposed in this paper extends its scope of application on the basis of PACS, increases its robustness, and provides new ideas for more extensive. multi-level, safe and reliable medical images sharing.

AB Nowadays, numerous applications of smart home systems provide recommendations for users, including reducing their energy consumption, warnings of defective devices, selecting reliable devices and software, diagnoses, etc [1]. The internet connected, dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the smart home environment creates new security, authentication, and privacy challenges [2]. To solve those challenges, an approach to data privacy in smart home using blockchain technology, which is called smart home based the IoT-Blockchain (SHIB), is proposed in this paper. In order to demonstrate the proposed architecture, an experimental scenario using Ganache, Remix, and web3.js is built among the user, service provider, and smart home to evaluate the performance of the smart contract in the SHIB. Based on the experiment results, the SHIB architecture brings the advantages like data privacy, trust access control, and high extension ability. In addition, the comparison between the proposed architecture and existing models in different parameters such as smart contract, the privacy of data, usage of tokens, updating the policies, and misbehavior judging are performed.

AB Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts - Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network and usually manipulate digital units of value. A peer-to-peer network of mutually distrusting nodes maintains a common view of the global state and executes code upon request. The stated is stored in a blockchain secured by a proof-of-work consensus mechanism similar to that in Bitcoin. The core value proposition of Ethereum is a full-featured programming language suitable for implementing complex business logic.
   Decentralized applications without a trusted third party are appealing in areas like crowdfunding, financial services, identity management, and gambling. Smart contracts are a challenging research topic that spans over areas ranging from cryptography, consensus algorithms, and programming languages to governance, finance, and law.
   This paper summarizes the state of knowledge in this field. We provide a technical overview of Ethereum, outline open challenges, and review proposed solutions. We also mention alternative smart contract blockchains.

AB Digital identity is unsolved: after many years of research there is still no trusted communication over the Internet. To provide identity within the context of mutual distrust, this paper presents a blockchain-based digital identity solution. Without depending upon a single trusted third party, the proposed solution achieves passport-level legally valid identity. This solution for making identities Self-Sovereign, builds on a generic provable claim model for which attestations of truth from third parties need to be collected. The claim model is then shown to be both blockchain structure and proof method agnostic. Four different implementations in support of these two claim model properties are shown to offer sub-second performance for claim creation and claim verification. Through the properties of Self-Sovereign Identity, legally valid status and acceptable performance, our solution is considered to be fit for adoption by the general public.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) technology is emerging to advance the modern defense and warfare applications because the battlefield things, such as combat equipment, warfighters, and vehicles, can sense and disseminate information from the battlefield to enable real-time decision making on military operations and enhance autonomy in the battlefield. Since this Internet-of-Battlefield Things (IoBT) environment is highly heterogeneous in terms of devices, network standards, platforms, connectivity, and so on, it introduces trust, security, and privacy challenges when battlefield entities exchange information with each other. To address these issues, we propose a Blockchain-empowered auditable platform for IoBT and describe its architectural components, such as battlefield-sensing layer, network layer, and consensus and service layer, in depth. In addition to the proposed layered architecture, this paper also presents several open research challenges involved in each layer to realize the Blockchain-enabled IoBT platform.

AB Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most important security mechanisms that help identify various attacks. To enhance the detection performance of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection systems or networks (CIDSs or CIDNs) are often implemented in practical organizations, which encourage a set of IDS nodes to exchange information like alarms and signatures with each other. However, due to the distributed nature, malicious nodes within such collaborative network are able to generate untruthful signatures and share to others. This may significantly degrade the effectiveness and efficiency of detection. Recently, blockchain technology has received much attention from both academia and industry, which can provide a verifiable manner for distributed architectures without the need of a trusted intermediary. In this work, our motivation is thus to develop CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchained signature-based IDSs, which utilizes blockchains to help incrementally update a trusted signature database for different IDS nodes in a collaborative network. In the evaluation, our results show that blockchain technology can indeed help enhance the robustness and effectiveness of signature-based IDSs under adversarial scenarios via building a trusted signature database.

AB In recent years, the advancement in modern technologies has not only resulted in an explosion of huge data sets being captured and recorded in different fields, but also given rise to concerns in the security and protection of data during storage, transmission, processing, and access. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records transactions in a secure, flexible, verifiable and permanent way. Transactions in a blockchain can be an exchange of an asset, the execution of the terms of a smart contract, or an update to a record. In this paper, we have developed a blockchain access control ecosystem that gives asset owners the sovereign right to effectively manage access control of large data sets and protect against data breaches. The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric blockchain is used to run the business network while the Hyperledger composer modeling tool is used to implement the smart contracts or transaction processing functions that run on the blockchain network.

AB With respect to power consumption, cryptocurrencies have been discussed in a twofold way: First, the cost-benefit ratio of mining hardware in order to gain revenue from mining that exceeds investment and electricity costs. Second, the overall electric energy consumption of cryptocurrencies to estimate the environmental effects of Proof-of-Work. In this paper, we consider a complementary aspect: The stability of the power grids themselves. Power grids have to continuously maintain an equilibrium between power supply and consumption; extended periods of imbalance cause significant deviation of the utility frequency from its nominal value and destabilize the power grid, eventually leading to large-scale blackouts. Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies are potential candidates for creating such imbalances as disturbances in mining can cause abrupt changes in power demand. The problem is amplified by the ongoing centralization of mining hardware in large mining pools. Therefore, we investigate power consumption characteristics of miners, consult mining pool data, and analyze the amount of total power consumption as well as its worldwide distribution of two major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ethereum. Thus, answering the question: Are Proof-of-Work based cryptocurrencies a threat to reliable power grid operation?.

AB To ensure integrity, trust, immutability and authenticity of software and information (cyber data, user data and attack event data) in a collaborative environment, research is needed for cross-domain data communication, global software collaboration, sharing, access auditing and accountability. Blockchain technology can significantly automate the software export auditing and tracking processes. It allows to track and control what data or software components are shared between entities across multiple security domains. Our blockchain-based solution relies on role-based and attribute-based access control and prevents unauthorized data accesses. It guarantees integrity of provenance data on who updated what software module and when. Furthermore, our solution detects data leakages, made behind the scene by authorized blockchain network participants, to unauthorized entities. Our approach is used for data forensics/provenance, when the identity of those entities who have accessed/updated/transferred the sensitive cyber data or sensitive software is determined. All the transactions in the global collaborative software development environment are recorded in the blockchain public ledger and can be verified any time in the future. Transactions can not be repudiated by invokers. We also propose modified transaction validation procedure to improve performance and to protect permissioned IBM Hyperledger-based blockchains from DoS attacks, caused by bursts of invalid transactions.

AB Real-world smart contracts which preserve the privacy of both, their users and their data, have barely been proposed theoretically, let alone been implemented practically. In this paper, we are the first to implement a privacy-preserving protocol from the energy domain as a smart contract in Ethereum. We elaborate on and present our implementation as well as our practical findings, including more or less subtle traps and pitfalls. Despite major optimizations to our implementation, we find that while it is currently possible, it is not feasible to implement a privacy-preserving protocol of modest complexity in the Ethereum blockchain due to the high cost of operation and the lack of privacy by design.

Because these keys can be stolen or hacked, we suggest to prevent these risks by using javacard secure elements. We detailed the interface of a Crypto Currency Smart Card (CCSC) designed over a JC3.04 standard platform. We details two use cases. First deals with deployment of the CCSC application in low cost low power object powered by an open hardware (arduino) platform, and integrates sensor data in ethereum transactions. Second proposes the deployment in the cloud of CCSC javacards plugged to RACS servers, in order to enable the remote and safe use of ECDSA signature.

AB The exponential growth of wireless services with diversity of devices and applications has inspired the research community to come up with novel concepts to improve the efficiency of resource use. It is cost efficient and practical to be able to evaluate and analyze expected value of use cases before actual implementation of the solution. This paper presents blockchain network slice brokering use case value analysis and results in the industrial automation application scenario. The use case value was assessed applying resource configuration framework against blockchain and smart contracts characteristics and capabilities. According to the findings, expected value of blockchain network slice brokering use case was proven and in general feasibility of blockchain technology for novel resource configurations use cases for various network functions was stated. The use case enables industrial automation processes and related manufacturing equipment to autonomously and dynamically acquire the slice needed for most efficient operations. The resource configuration framework provides a dynamic framework for analyzing and developing the blockchain enabled novel use cases and business models.

TI Ensuring Data Protection by Private Law Contract Monitoring: A Legal and
   Value-Based Approach
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB Current legal frameworks for data protection are based on public law. They have a number of flaws. The notion of informed consent does not work in practice. Public legislation only covers the protection of personal data, but it doesn't cover data about groups and it doesn't cover conditions on usage of data for certain purposes. Moreover, in order to function in practice, businesses need to adopt these conditions as part of privacy policies and processes such as audits and impact assessments. Supervision by means of public entities is limited as regulatory agencies have little capacity. This gives private actors room for designing tools to protect their personal data. In this article, we will therefore suggest to utilize private law instruments for data protection. By incorporating conditions on usage of sensitive data in contracts and by setting up platforms for monitoring contract fulfilment, end users can be empowered to take enforcement into their own hands. We will propose a platform for assisting users in drafting contracts that take data protection into account, and for monitoring contract fulfilment. Feasibility of the proposal is illustrated by an application scenario, the sports tracker app.

TI Arbitration and New Technologies: Mutual Benefits
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION
AB New technologies such as Big Data, blockchain, machine learning, and text-mining have made it to the legal world, simplifying all phases of the dispute resolution process. Arbitration and these new technologies share a mutually beneficial relationship. On the one hand, new technologies will improve efficiency, cut costs, promote the expansion of arbitration into new segments of the market, and improve outcomes for clients. On the other hand, the proliferation of new technologies will inevitably generate disputes that arbitration is best-suited to resolve. For example, although self-execution limits certain litigation risks concerning the performance of smart contracts, conflicts regarding their definition, interpretation, and general framework are likely to arise. The delocalized nature of the arbitral regime, the flexibility of proceedings, and the straightforward enforcement of awards are key features that make arbitration the optimal dispute resolution mechanism for new technology disputes. New technologies can thus reinforce arbitral proceedings, and arbitration can provide insurance to these emerging practices - these reciprocal benefits should be exploited.

AB There has been a vast increase in incidents related to multimedia copyright and security breaches in the past few years, compromising users' privacy. One such breach involved the seventh season of the TV series "Game of Thrones", where episodes were illegally downloaded before the official release date etc. Such security breaches raise questions about the approaches and models that currently apply to data privacy and security, where the user saves and distributes his data personally or depends on a third party or stakeholder to manage the distribution rights of sensitive data. When it comes to multimedia, many companies or multimedia owners rely on third parties. distributors and sales persons to monitor their publicity, maintain their popularity and sell their multimedia content. Blockchain technology, which was originally devised for the digital currency (cryptocurrency), has distinct features such as distributed networking, data privacy, trust less computing etc. This technology attracts great interest from the research community due to its innovative properties which can he applied to many business applications, one being access control over data.
   In this paper, we present a decentralized data management framework that ensures user data privacy and control. We propose a protocol that uses blockchain technology to take control of the user's data. This protocol enables the user to have full control over his multimedia files and he doesn't need to trust a third party. The framework allows the user to not only store data but also to query and share data as well as auditing. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions of blockchain technology as a medium to ensure privacy, data control, auditing and trust management in different areas.

AB As an alternative to the energy greedy proof-of-work, new blockchains constrain the set of participants whose selection is debatable. These blockchains typically allow a fixed consortium of machines to decide upon new transaction blocks.
   In this paper, we introduce the community blockchain that bridges the gap between these public blockchains and constrained blockchains. The idea is to allow potentially all participants to decide upon "some" block while restricting the set of participants deciding upon "one" block.
   We also propose an implementation called ComChain that builds upon the Red Belly Blockchain, the fastest blockchain we are aware of. It runs a consensus among the existing community to elect a new community. This reconfiguration speeds up as the number of removed nodes increases.

AB Public key infrastructure (PKI) is the foundation and core of network security construction. Blockchain (Be) has many technical characteristics, such as decentralization, impossibility of being tampered with and forged, which makes it have incomparable advantages in ensuring information credibility, security, traceability and other aspects of traditional technology. In this paper, a method of constructing PKI certificate system based on permissioned BC is proposed. The problems of multi CA mutual trust, poor certificate configuration efficiency and single point failure in digital certificate system are solved by using the characteristics of BC distribution and non-tampering. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of identity privacy on BC, this paper proposes a privacy-aware PKI system based on permissioned BCs. This system is an anonymous digital certificate publishing scheme, which achieves the separation of user registration and authorization, and has the characteristics of anonymity and conditional traceability, so as to realize to protect user's identity privacy. The system meets the requirements of certificate security and anonymity, reduces the cost of CA construction, operation and maintenance in traditional PKI technology, and improves the efficiency of certificate application and configuration.

AB Prediction markets are markets where participants trade contracts whose payoffs are tied to a future event, thereby yielding prices that can be interpreted as market aggregated forecasts. Past studies have shown that the prediction markets can provide accurate forecasts, sometimes better than sophisticated statistical tools. Due to their advantages, prediction markets have been widely used in the prediction of elections, project management, product quality, and impact of events. However, prediction markets also have some limitations, e.g., poor anonymity and limited market liquidity. In this paper, we propose to apply blockchain powered smart contracts to the prediction markets. First, we give a comprehensive overview on the prediction markets, including their theoretical basis, classification and applications. Second, we present how to design prediction markets based on smart contracts. Then, the algorithm of contracts implementation is proposed. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, an intra-enterprise prediction market is built based on a private blockchain. The experimental results show that the market can make accurate prediction for a particular event. In addition, the autonomy, self-sufficiency, and decentralization characteristics of blockchain make the prediction markets more efficient and robust.

AB Customer(1) service plays an important role in gaining income for organizations. It is a knowledge intensive process that relies heavily on well-trained or experienced employees. Recently, automated customer service is emerging. It can help organizations reduce operation and training costs. They apply machine learning to big data to provide automated or semi-automated customer service. However, most startups or small and medium enterprises do not have sufficient data and knowledge. As a result, they still rely on customer service personnel or use automated customer service provided by third parties. Therefore, it is difficult for them to develop their own core customer service competency. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based AutoML framework that aims to provide an open environment for data trading. The architecture, dataflow, and key elements are presented and discussed. The framework not only helps organizations that do not have sufficient training data and knowledge to provide automated customer services, but also maintains continuous updates and learning in a reduced cost and risk.

AB Real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) is the cornerstone of inter-bank payment business. Spectacular expansion of large-value wholesale payment has forced financial institutions to implement inter-bank payment systems (IBPS) with higher level of throughput, security, and stability. This promising approach to orchestrating IBPS utilizes emerging blockchain technology, which has been successfully harnessed to deliver distributed trust and confidentiality for diverse financial service applications. However, blockchain is not a silver bullet for IBPS, which faces multiple challenges incurred by high value transactions. Financial institutions expect not only a simple migration from traditional RTGS to a blockchain platform, but a decentralized system with better confidentiality, instruction settlement finality, liquidity saving mechanism, and more efficient methods of gridlock resolution. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end IBPS prototype based on Hyperledger Fabric enterprise blockchain platform. The prototype supports gross settlement, gridlock resolution, and reconciliation for inter-bank payment business. As a preliminary research of Ubin Project, this prototype is proved to provide higher level of payment settlement service.

AB Ethereum, as the first Turing-complete blockchain platform, provides various application program interfaces for developers. Although blockchain has highly improved security, faulty configuration and usage can result in serious vulnerabilities. In this paper, we focus on the security vulnerabilities of the official Go-version Ethereum client (geth). The vulnerabilities are because of the insecure API design and the specific Ethereum wallet mechanism. We demonstrate attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities in an Ethereum testbed. The vulnerabilities are confirmed by the scanning results on the public Internet. Finally, corresponding countermeasures against attacks are provided to enhance the security of the Ethereum platform.

AB Logistics management plays a crucial role in the execution and success of international trades. Current solutions for logistics management suffer from a number of issues. One of the major areas for improvement is inconsistent data and lack of trust and transparency between multiple participants. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) or blockchain has the inherent characteristics to address this issue, and is well suited to be applied to supply chain document and workflow management. This paper demonstrates how to apply DLT to achieve a higher level of efficiency through consistent data store, automated workflow process, and tamper-proof transaction history for provenance in the supply chain.

The existing centralized authentication protocols traditionally used for MEO/GEO satellite networks cannot accommodate LEO satellites with frequent user connection switching. This paper proposes a fast and efficient access verification protocol named BAVP by combining identity-based encryption and blockchain technology. Two different key management schemes with IBE and blockchain, respectively, are investigated, which further enhance the authentication reliability and efficiency in LEO constellation. Experiments on OPNET simulation platform evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness, reliability, and fast-switching efficiency of the proposed protocol. For LEO networks, BAVP surpasses the well-known existing solutions with significant advantages in both performance and scalability which are supported by theoretical analysis and simulation results.

AB Payment transaction channels are one of the main proposed approaches to scaling cryptocurrency payment systems. Recent work by Malavolta et al. [7] has shown that the privacy of the protocol may conflict with its concurrent nature and may lead to deadlocks. In this paper we ask the natural question: can payments in routing networks be routed so as to avoid deadlocks altogether? Our results show that it is in general NP-complete to determine whether a deadlock-free routing exists in a given payment graph. On the other hand, Given some fixed routing, we propose another way to resolve the problem of deadlocks. We offer a modification of the protocols in lightning network and in Fulgor [7] that pre-locks edges in an order that guarantees progress, while still maintaining the protocol's privacy requirements.

AB Recently there has been much academic and industrial interest in practical implementations of zero knowledge proofs. These techniques allow a party to prove to another party that a given statement is true without revealing any additional information. In a Bitcoin-like system, this allows a payer to prove validity of a payment without disclosing the payment's details.
   Unfortunately, the existing systems for generating such proofs are very expensive, especially in terms of memory overhead. Worse yet, these systems are "monolithic", so they are limited by the memory resources of a single machine. This severely limits their practical applicability.
   We describe DIZK, a system that distributes the generation of a zero knowledge proof across machines in a compute cluster. Using a set of new techniques, we show that DIZK scales to computations of up to billions of logical gates (100x larger than prior art) at a cost of 10 mu s per gate (100x faster than prior art). We then use DIZK to study various security applications.

TI A Remote Attestation Security Model Based on Privacy-Preserving
   Blockchain for V2X
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The vehicle to everything (V2X) requires the real-time integration of all kinds of information on roads, pedestrians, the environment, and vehicles themselves. This information also needs to be shared with other vehicles. The effective integration of information and the strong privacy protection are the key restrictions on the development of the V2X. The previous privacy protection model has mainly focused on the centralized network, and there were problems with the centralized gateway and single-point decision, which were not suitable for the decentralized scenario. Therefore, this paper proposes a remote attestation security model based on a privacy-preserving blockchain. The overall model involves two core steps. First, the vehicle provides the network with an evidence of a credible identity and integrity. Secured, the vehicles in the network calculate the nodes to make their respective decisions, and the accounting nodes summarize the sub-conclusions, form the final results, and write them into data blocks. The analysis shows that it possesses the security features of decentralization, traceability, anonymity, irreplaceability, and high efficiency. The model framework, core block chain structure, and protocol process are described in detail. The experimental results based on a realistic infrastructure are presented. These experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively enhance the security of the communications of intelligent vehicles in the V2X.

AB This paper describes a novel Byzantine fault tolerant protocol that allows replicas to join and exit dynamically. With the astonishing success of cryptocurrencies, people attach great importance in "blockchain" and robust Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) protocols for consensus. Among the conventional wisdom, the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), proposed by Miguel and Liskov in 1999, occupies an important position.
   Although PBFT has many advantages, it has fatal disadvantages. Firstly, it works in a completely enclosed environment, where users who want to add or take out any node must stop the whole system. Secondly, although PBFT guarantees liveness and safety if at most [n-1/3] out of a total n replicas are faulty, it takes no measure to deal with these ineffective or malicious replicas, which is harmful to the system and will cause system crash finally. These drawbacks are unbearable in practice. In order to solve them, we present an alternative, Dynamic PBFT.

AB Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Although transactions are conducted between pseudonyms, Bitcoin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees. Mixing coins, to some extent, can address this drawback through different technologies, but also meets flexibility, storage and anonymity problems. This paper proposes a decentralized coin mixing scheme CoinMingle, based on ring signature, one-time output address, CoinJoin and our mutual recognition delegation strategy. Our mutual recognition delegation strategy is simple but effective: when a user prepares to submit messages, he will delegate it to other users for anonymity. Users in CoinMingle don't need pre-compute. And CoinMingle can tolerate different input amounts and plug the leak of personal information in shuffling phase. In addition, CoinMingle owns parallel structure which is more efficient than other coin mixing schemes.

AB Blockchain is first introduced by Bitcoin in 2009 and developers all around the world have been trying to apply blockchain in different areas, like finance services, credit and ownership management, resource sharing, investment management, Internet of Things (IoT) etc. Ethereum is a Blockchain 2.0 platform that allows developers to build a Decentralized Application (DApp) without building a new blockchain from the scratch. IoT is the technology to embed all the physical devices with sensors and chips to provide automation process via machine to -machine communication. Blynk is a platform that provides iOS and Android application for the users and developers to collect data from control microcontroller. This paper is aiming to build a system with Ethereum private Blockchain, Raspberry Pi (RPi), Blynk platform, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensors. The system is a proof-of-concept prototype to simulate smart home applications. It collects the real-time room temperature and humidity by DHT11 via Raspberry Pi. The sensor data will be updated to the Blynk App and stored on the smart contract deployed on the Ethereum private Blockchain. If the real-time temperature or humidity value exceeds the threshold value set by the users, red or green LEDs will be turned on as warnings. This system can be improved by some possible future work.

AB The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) allows heterogeneous embedded smart devices to collaboratively provide smart services with or without human intervention. While leveraging the large-scale IoT-based applications like Smart Gird or Smart Cities, IoT also incurs more concerns on privacy and security. Among the top security challenges that IoT face, access authorization is critical in resource sharing and information protection. One of the weaknesses of today's access control (AC) is the centralized authorization server, which can be the performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. In this paper, BlendCAC, a blockchain-enabled decentralized capability-based AC is proposed for the security of IoTs. The BlendCAC aims at an effective access control processes to devices, services and information in large scale IoT systems. Based on the blockchain network, a capability delegation mechanism is suggested for access permission propagation. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of a smart contract for registration, propagation and revocation of the access authorization. In the proposed BlendCAC scheme, IoT devices are their own master to control their resources instead of being supervised by a centralized authority. Implemented and tested on a Raspberry Pi device and on a local private blockchain network, the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed BlendCAC approach to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution to IoT systems.

AB The emergence of big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is reshaping the world. While the technological revolution improves the quality of our life, new concerns are triggered. The superhuman capability enables AI to outperform human workers in many data-and/or computing-intensive tasks. Also, digital superpowers are showing arrogance towards individuals, which erodes the trust foundation of the society. In this position paper, we suggest to construct trustworthy and safe communities based on a BLockchain-Enabled Social credits System (BLESS) that rewards the residents who commit in socially beneficial activities. Human being's true value lies in serving other people. The BLESS system is considered as an efficient approach to promote the value and dignity in efforts focused on enhancing our communities and regulating business and private behaviors. The BLESS system leverages the decentralized architecture of the blockchain network, which not only allows grassroots individuals to participate rating process of a social credit system (SCS), but also provides tamper proof of transaction data in the trustless network environment. The anonymity in blockchain records also protects individuals from being targeted in the fight against powerful enterprises. Smart contract enabled authentication and authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized entity from accessing the credit system. The BLESS scheme is promising to offer a secure, transparent and decentralized SCS.

AB Bitcoin-derived blockchain has shown promise as infrastructure for many decentralized models. However, problems are withholding the realization of the potentials. The booming increase of storage demand has hindered devices with storage shortage to use blockchain powered distributed applications. In this paper, we present section-blockchain, a new blockchain protocol, which is designed to solve the oversize storage problem without compromise the security of blockchain. There are no full nodes or lightweight nodes, all nodes are equal and contributing to the Section-Blockchain network. Experiments demonstrate that Section-Blockchain is efficient, remarkably reduced the storage, and withstand sudden nodes losing of massive scale. Section-blockchain also extended the capability of blockchain to the foundation of an autotrophic, tamper-resist decentralized storage system, in which, data can be equidistributional distributed worldwide automatically without any centralized dispatcher to assign storage; nodes are motivated to change their local storage to receive more remuneration. The global storage distribution is continuously optimizing and fit into any adding/losing nodes.

AB Recently, Blockchain becomes a hot research topic due to the success of Blockchain in many applications, such as cryptocurrency, smart contract, digital assets, distributed cloud storage and so on. The power of Blockchain is that it can achieve the consensus of an ordered set of transactions among nodes which do not trust each other, even with the existence of malicious nodes. However, compared to traditional databases, the current Blockchain technology still cannot handle a massive number of transactions, which is caused by many factors, such as the consensus protocol, structure of the blocks and storage challenge. Among them, the high storage requirement is a key factor that prevents the wide usage of Blockchain on various devices such as mobile phones or low-end PCs. In this paper, to address the storage challenge, we introduce a novel concept called Consensus Unit (CU), which organizes different nodes into one unit and lets them to store at least one copy of Blockchain data in the system together. Based on this idea, we further define the Blocks Assignment Optimization (BAO) problem which determines the optimal assignment of blocks such that the storage space is fully used and the query cost is minimized. We prove that the BAO problem is NP-hard. Thus, we propose three efficient heuristic algorithms to solve the static assignment problem. Furthermore, we present solutions to address the dynamic scenarios when new blocks arrive and nodes join or depart from the CU. To verify the effectiveness of CU, we have conducted extensive experiments on synthetic data and BLOCKBENCH [1]. The results have confirmed the superiority of CU in saving the storage and maintaining the system throughput.

AB In this paper, we propose a new framework based on two main concepts: Software-Defined Vehicular Networks (SDVN) and Blockchain to efficiently manage and secure Vehicular Social Network (VSN). Using SDVN makes the network programmable, virtualized, and partitionable, but also it creates a well-known vulnerability named single-point of failure. Hence we propose to introduce a Blockchain paradigm that enables to certify the transactions and provide anonymity of data in distributed way using miners nodes. To this end, we introduce three levels of controllers: Principal controller (PC), Road Side Units (RSU) and miners. The PC has a global overview of the network like network topology. The RSU is an intermediate between the PC and the miners. We select local controllers acting as miners due to safety and performance. In order to select miners, we propose a Distributed Miners Connected Dominating Set algorithm (DM-CDS). The DM-CDS is a distributed algorithm with a single phase that supports dynamic topology. The selection of miners is based on a function called miner-score which depends on trust parameter particularly trust metric and network parameters such as: the connectivity degree, the average link quality indicator and the rank. The performance of the proposed DM-CDS is evaluated using many scenarios with different parameters like trust metric, node density, node mobility and radio range. The obtained results show the importance of the proposed architecture in terms of number of miners (CDS size) and robustness with different scenarios.

SO EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB Innovation technologies have substantially changed commerce and society. A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers' rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks.

AB BlockChain (BC) technology is the digital currency-the underlying technology of Bitcoin, which has attracted more and more attention in recent years. BC is a distributed database system with decentralized and unfalsified features that make it be expected to lead a new revolution in the technology industry. The prominent feature of BC makes it break away from currency applications and gradually enter into non-monetary applications. The distributed and anti-attack characteristics of BC technology can be well integrated into Internet of things (IoT). The existing technical features of BC enable it to realize distributed privacy and security in IoT. This paper introduces the main problems in the development of IoT and the characteristics of BC in the application of IoT. We also discusses the main direction of BC in the application of IoT. But BC can't be applied directly to IoT, and the fusion of two technologies will face many challenges. Based on these, this paper analyzes the challenges of BC in the application of IoT.

AB Recently, the global outbreak of a blackmail virus WannaCry, makes the blockchain a hot topic. The security of blockchain is always the focus of people's attention, and it is also the main reason why the blockchain has not been widely used all over the world. Many researches use mathematical derivation method to analyse the 51%-Attacks influence of blockchain, which is very stiff and difficult to understand. In this paper, we propose a method to simulate blockchain's process and discover the rule between attacking method, attacking power and security of blockchain. We take 51%-Attacks as an example and use Java to simulate the running process. By adjusting the value of attacking power, we can get most states of blockchain and analyze the probability that honest state becomes attacking state. We use various forms to analyze and show the experimental result, which verify our method is correct and feasible. This method can also be implemented as a middleware software of blockchain to detect the security of blockchain.

AB Recently, the popularity and universality of smart-devices has led to rapid advancement in the development of applications for mobile commerce around the world. Novel mobile payment schemes, such as Apple pay, Android pay, and Samsung pay are becoming an increasingly popular ways to conduct online transactions, no matter what type of smart devices are used. Due to the attendant growth in the importance of security, significant attention has been devoted to the challenge of designing and implementing a robust mobile payment scheme for securing online transactions. In this paper, we demonstrate a robust mobile payment scheme based on sturdy certificateless signatures with bilinear pairing. We elegantly refine the proposed mobile payment scheme to make it suitable for computation-constrained mobile devices. The practicability of the proposed mobile payment scheme is then certified via a rigorous security analysis and thorough performance evaluation using the Raspberry PI as the implementation platform for our proposed scheme. Furthermore, we implement a transaction repository with the aid of smart contract technology. The simulation results, based on Ethereum, demonstrate the feasibility of employing the smart contract technology to secure mobile payments.

AB Automated sales systems, a recent technology, offer a wide range of products and services. This technology has advanced by combining with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, because of the development of such technology, data storage and management systems with trusted third parties cannot efficiently defend against data forgery attacks. In this study, a blockchain network is applied to an automated sales system. A smart automated sales machine using smart contracts is proposed. This system enables users to know the quantity of products or status of service provision before they visit an automated sales system. In addition, the system administrator can immediately see the expense-reduction effect of system management and address any problems in the system.

AB Cryptographic techniques are employed to ensure the security of voting systems in order to increase its wide adoption. However, in such electronic voting systems, the public bulletin board that is hosted by the third party for publishing and auditing the voting results should be trusted by all participants. Recently a number of blockchain-based solutions have been proposed to address this issue. However, these systems are impractical to use due to the limitations on the voter and candidate numbers supported, and their security framework, which highly depends on the underlying blockchain protocol and suffers from potential attacks (e.g., force-abstention attacks). To deal with two aforementioned issues, we propose a practical platform-independent secure and verifiable voting system that can be deployed on any blockchain that supports an execution of a smart contract. Verifiability is inherently provided by the underlying blockchain platform, whereas cryptographic techniques like Paillier encryption, proof-of-knowledge, and linkable ring signature are employed to provide a framework for system security and user-privacy that are independent from the security and privacy features of the blockchain platform. We analyse the correctness and coercion-resistance of our proposed voting system. We employ Hyperledger Fabric to deploy our voting system and analyse the performance of our deployed scheme numerically.

AB Blockchain technology has been showing its strong performance on decentralized security when integrating with Internet of Things network. However, the trilemma of scalability-security-decentralization exists in Blockchain-based IoT. Therein the typical round-robin scheduling implemented in the Byzantine Faulty Tolerance (BFT) proposed by Neo's Blockchain has a significant delay when consecutive faulty miners exist. This paper proposes a novel analysis model for evaluating the network performance collapse in general, followed by an optimized round-robin scheduling for the case when the mutual latency difference is not significant enough for ranking. Based on the model, the optimized mechanism is able to increase the block rate for a specific subset of consecutive faulty miners by nearly 50% and provide a linearly positive growth rate of the mitigation with respect to the fail rate of a single miner, which strongly promotes the efficiency of the P2P-based BFT consensus algorithm.

It is regarded as one of the most important technology for the fourth industrial revolution, although there exit few the real-world production-level applications due to the hardly tolerant performance of most of the existing blockchain systems. Therefore, how to improve its performance has been identified as one of the most significant research directions in order to use blockchain for practical applications. In this paper, we present a method to build a scalable and extendible blockchain system by multiple chains and sharding techniques.

TI MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING OF ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS WITH THE USE OF
   CRYPTOCURRENCIES
SO FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The need to obtain prompt access to funds through electronic communications, protecting investment after the global financial crisis has led to the emergence of a new type of electronic money - the cryptocurrencies. The modern state and prospects for development of the cryptocurrency as a special kind of electronic money were expounded. Cryptocurrencies gain significant popularity due to the advantages of their use, such as: comfort, independence, accessibility, lack of engagement, confidentiality, no documents, full automation of accounting, and cost optimization for administration. Various scientific positions concerning the accounting and economic positioning of the cryptocurrencies in Ukraine were researched. The proposed order to display in accounting the processes of initial obtaining (mining) with the definition of a cost calculating method and operation of the cryptocurrencies most fully corresponds to the national accounting treatment. It was proposed to resolve to the problems of management accounting of electronic money and cryptocurrencies in Ukraine through the combination of functional capabilities of the blockchain technology, positive qualities of the "Internet Bank" and "Client-Bank" communications, which will enable to create a hybrid system of non-cash payments by the cryptocurrencies, electronic money, funds on accounts in a bank with free conversion of existing funds and possibilities for information exchange with all the participants in settlement operations. The article presents a methodology for collecting accounting information on settlements with the cryptocurrencies and other electronic money without the formation of traditional payment documents and bank statements. Electronic information from the hybrid communication system is the foundation for fully automated documenting, formation of accounting records, informing accountants and management of non-cash transfers. Automation of management accounting of electronic transactions helps to increase the level of internal and external control over execution of money operations due to timely and remote informing sharing about the parameters of payments.

AB Blockchain-based platforms, such as Ethereum, allow transactions in blocks to call user-defined scripts named smart contracts. In the blockchain network, after being generated by a miner, a block will be validated many times by the peers who accept it. Hence by enabling concurrency on smart contracts, especially validation, we can improve the efficiency and the throughput of those platforms.
   By introducing multiversion transaction ordering, this paper presents a concurrent scheme called MVTO to run smart contracts concurrently. First, the miners are able to use any concurrency control technique to discover a conflict-serializable schedule. Then, validators use MVTO to verify the block by replaying this schedule concurrently and deterministically. The evaluation shows that this mechanism achieves approximately 2.5x speedup in the block validation using a thread pool with 3 threads.

TI A New Post-Quantum Blind Signature From Lattice Assumptions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB At present, several post-quantum cryptosystems have been proposed, and lattice-based cryptography is the main candidate. Especially in the direction of digital signatures, there are now many practical lattice-based signature schemes. However, there exist few lattice-based signatures with special property such as blind signature. Blind signature was introduced by Chaum for creating untraceable payment system. Then, it is widely used in e-cash and voting, especially in the revolutionary digital cash system based on blockchain. In our paper, we present a method to construct a post-quantum blind signature based on lattice assumptions, and we proved that any existential forger against the security of the resulting scheme can solve the SISq,n,m,beta problem for beta = (O) over tilde (d ). Our main technique is the rejection sampling theory. The expected number of times needed to output a blind signature is at most e(2) under aborting, and our new scheme has much smaller signature size than those of all the previously proposed blind signature schemes over lattices.

TI Blockchain-Based Secure Equipment Diagnosis Mechanism of Smart Grid
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The smart terminal and grid protection devices play a very important role in the safe operation of the smart grid. Traditional maintenance and renewal of the center node wastes a lot of manpower and material resources and have huge safety implications. This paper proposes a safety equipment diagnosis mechanism based on consortium blockchain technology to realize more efficient, convenient, and secure device maintenance. When a device has problems or notices improper operation, it can make a device diagnosis request in the consortium blockchain network, and receive a diagnosis response from a vendor or non-original supplier nodes. This scheme designs a decentralized safety equipment diagnosis smart contract, combining response node bid price and credit, and applies a multi-dimensional reverse auction mechanism to determine bid node and transaction price. After a smart device diagnosed, the relevant message will be packaged and sent to a smartphone, which can use the client to set up the smart contract of equipment operation policy. Paillier encryption arithmetic can be used to ensure device diagnosis mechanism safety. The proposed scheme is guaranteed not to reveal sensitive information in the process of device interaction.

TI Mchain: A Blockchain-Based VM Measurements Secure Storage Approach in
   IaaS Cloud With Enhanced Integrity and Controllability
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Virtual machine (VM) measurements data in IaaS cloud play a crucial role in integrity evaluation and decision making. Hence, the secure storage for these data has attracted more attention recently. This paper proposes a novel approach, named Mchain, to enhance the integrity and controllability of the secure storage. Especially, to enhance the integrity, a two-layer blockchain network is introduced. In the first layer, after the production, the data packages are first verified by leveraging a correspondence between a package and a policy, and a one-to-one relation among a VM, a user, and a node. After that, we propose a consensus achievement algorithm to construct a semi-finished block on a candidate block arranged by data packages. Meanwhile, the semi-finished block is distributed to all nodes, which can provide a certain integrity. In the second-layer, tamper-resistant metadata is generated by performing PoW tasks on the semi-finished block, resulting in strong integrity. Further, to enhance the controllability, a revisable user-defined policy-based encryption method with KP-ABE is proposed. It helps to flexibly control the scope of authorized verifiers. The experimental results on six scenarios with simulated data set show that the proposed approach is appealing in integrity and controllability, and the time overhead of data storage.

AB With the continuous development of the Internet of Things (IoT), the surge in data generated by sensors and smart devices has caused data overload in designated centralized data centers. However, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage, cannot afford to manage these gigantic data in the suitable way. Due to the lots of devices and senors continuously creating data, traditional IoT architectures must address many challenges that are not designed to provide trust, security, resiliency, and low latency. To solve theses problems, we propose a decentralized architecture named MicrothingsChain based on blockchain with smart contract, which enables edge computing nodes storing corresponding domain IoT data and interacting with each other safely. It brings computing and storage capabilities to the edge of the IoT network and realizes distributed storage of large amounts of data. Specially, MicrothingsChain adopts publish-subscribe mode, in which users can access the data across domain. Furthermore, we present one cryptographic currency for our ecology named MicroCoin. The security analysis and experimental results demonstrate that MicrothingsChain is suitable in practice.

AB Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts can have potentially devastating financial consequences. In light of this, several regulatory bodies have called for a need to audit smart contracts for security and correctness guarantees. Unfortunately, auditing smart contracts that do not have readily available source code can be challenging, and there are currently few tools available that aid in this process. Such contracts remain opaque to auditors. To address this, we present Erays, a reverse engineering tool for smart contracts. Erays takes in smart contract from the Ethereum blockchain, and produces high-level pseudocode suitable for manual analysis. We show how Erays can be used to provide insight into several contract properties, such as code complexity and code reuse in the ecosystem. We then leverage Erays to link contracts with no previously available source code to public source code, thus reducing the overall opacity in the ecosystem. Finally, we demonstrate how Erays can be used for reverse-engineering in four case studies: high-value multi-signature wallets, arbitrage bots, exchange accounts, and finally, a popular smart-contract game, Cryptokitties. We conclude with a discussion regarding the value of reverse engineering in the smart contract ecosystem, and how Erays can be leveraged to address the challenges that lie ahead.

AB Despite that the cloud computing is considered as the panacea of processing and analyzing IoT data, it shows drawbacks in many other aspects like latency, bandwidth, and mobility when transferring data from connected devices to the cloud. The fog computing paradigm extends the cloud and refers to a geographically distributed computing paradigm at the edge of IoT networks. However, realizing fog computing still has a long way to go, especially when it comes to security in the context of IoT unconventional characteristics such as scalability, heterogeneity, mobility and limited resources. In addition, applying social network principles to the IoT seems to be appealing to build the Internet of Things as a network of peer-to-peer networks. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid architecture for the Internet of things, combing fog computing to ensure security in the trustless IoT environment. By enabling our fog computing architecture with blockchain-based social networks, users could easily manage smart objects via establishing tamper-proof digital identities in a trustless environment and build a new class of authentication and authorization mechanisms for the IoT. We also demonstrate and analyze the feasibility of our architecture with a prototype.

TI SCENARIOS OF WORLD MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT:
   OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS FOR RUSSIA
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB The fundamental re-organization of the world monetary and financial system, currently based on the US dollar, is necessary prerequisite for creating conditions for stable, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy. Using the method of scenario analysis, the authors consider four possible options for long-term development of the world monetary and financial system. Their implementation depends on prevailing expectations in the society regarding the strengthening or weakening of regulation of monetary relations, the concentration or dispersion of control over monetary authorities. The first scenario "supranational money" involves the introduction of a global reserve currency operated beyond the jurisdiction of any particular country. This scenario is based on the transformation of the IMF into a bank of central banks, conversion of SDRs into a systemic standard of value, introduction of symmetric rights and obligations between creditors and debtors to finance payment imbalances, transition to real rather than nominal fixed exchange rates, re-direction of virtual capital flows to priority service of real sector of the economy, creating a liquid market for SDR-denominated bonds. The analysis of viability of "gold re-monetization" scenario stems from comparison of the views of leading American economists on the prospects of restoring various forms of the gold standard - from the classical one with reestablishing of the monetary functions of gold to the quasi-golden variant realized through a 100% bank reserve system. In "monetary polycentrism" scenario the attention is drawn to the fact that introduction of the Euro failed to ensure financial sovereignty of the member countries of the Eurozone and to prevent economic destabilization of the European economic and monetary union. It is emphasized that the federalization of Europe in the banking, budgetary, fiscal and political spheres as well as intensive internationalization of Renminbi could serve as the basis for creating real alternatives to US dollar hegemony in the world, followed by the formation of currency blocks in Eurasia with the participation of Russia and China. In "digital currency" scenario the authors develop the hypothesis of using crypto currency (bitcoin and its analogues) for expanding the virtual market space in order to form a global financial cybernetic system that is not controlled by state organizations and transnational corporations. The authors come to the conclusion that Russia needs to seriously prepare for implementation of all analyzed scenarios while relying on its own historic experience in creating alternative international trading and monetary system.

TI Blockchain Consensus Rule Based Dynamic Blind Voting for Non-Dependency
   Transaction
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB As in 2009 the first encrypted electronic currency Bitcoin is introduced, the block chain technology has received attention. Bitcoin is a currency issued without a trusted third party, in peer-to-peer (Peer-to-Peer) network and gives a guarantee of the reliability of money transactions, ensures the integrity of transactions. There is a back end-technique called block-chain that guarantees these without trusted third party. Block chain is a public ledger that all nodes to verify transactions and maintain integrity with the same ledger. Block chain technology applies not only electronic currency but also in various industries such as contract document integrity, cloud storage service, internet of thigns, supply chain for transaction integrity. However, there are problems to be solved if the bitcoin block chain consensus rule is applied to these industry. First, there is problem of low transaction throughput and block generation rate by an inefficient consensus rule. Second, There is problem of tampered block broadcast with non-dependency (internet of things data, food history data) transactions when applying the block chain consensus rule, which is proof-of-work of bitcoin's competitive system.
   To solve these problems, we propose new blockchain consensus algorithm for non-dependency transactions. In this paper, the blockchain transactions targeted internet of things data and food history. We propose consensus rule based voting for the efficiency, also propose method of imposing difficulty of block generation according to the voting result in order to prevent malicious node attacks. We provide experimental results on attack malicious node in the block chain implemented by the proposed consensus algorithms and the result is analyzed

   scaling
SO IEICE ELECTRONICS EXPRESS
AB In order to eliminate the excess timing margin in integrated circuit due to PVT variations, we propose a low overhead timing error prediction monitor, which has only 14 transistors with negligible power overhead. It can generate a predicted alarm signal when the timing is intense before real errors occur. A bunch of timing monitors are inserted at the end of selected critical paths. When there are timing prediction signals, the system clock will be stretched immediately to avoid real timing errors. Applied on a computation intensive Bitcoin Miner chip under 40 nm CMOS process, the simulation results show that it can operate at a wide voltage range of 0.5-1.1V. This timing prediction monitor based adaptive frequency scaling system can increase the frequency to 2.1x at near-Vth voltage and 1.21x at super-Vth region compared to the original non-monitored circuit. Thus, it is an effective way to mitigate the effect of PVT variations.

SO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB This study adds a phase-by-phase perspective to the well-known, and thoroughly analysed on a moment-by-moment basis, case of Lisa. The aim is to see whether this phase-by-phase analysis adds anything valuable to the understanding of the processes of change in this case and the therapeutic processes in general. In this good-outcome case study, a team of raters integrated the temporal sequencing phase component of the Paradigmatic Complementarity Metamodel (PCM) with a moment-by-moment tracking methodthe Developmental Analysis of Psychotherapy Process Method (DAPP)to analyse what occurred along the process that could explain the phase transitions and consolidations observed and how the therapist facilitated them. We illustrate and explain the therapeutic progression with therapeutic interactions from the dyad. The results suggest that Lisa evolved in accordance with the sequence of phases proposed by the PCM until phase 4 (out of 7). However, only phase 2 gains show evidence of structural consolidation. The sequence of phases proposed by the PCM seems to represent a natural progression for patients throughout the therapeutic process, and the consideration of a phase-by-phase map in analysing and thinking of therapeutic cases may be a valuable tool regarding clinical decision making.

AB This paper investigates ontological dimensions of the blockchain by asking what kind of socio-technical object bitcoin is. It discusses both blockchain's political qualities and the political forms enabled by its emergence. It first observes recent approaches to the ontology of money and the political qualities of the ledgers used by the current fractional reserve banking model. It then directs the same questions at blockchain technology. The paper discusses an ontology proposed by Ole Bjerg (2016) and argues in favour of a mixed-ontology approach to blockchains. It then questions the political qualities of the distributed ledger as a digital object and highlights the apparent absence of authority figures in the model. Finally, it argues that the political ontology of the blockchain can be framed as the displacement of authority from institutional actors into instrumental control of trust, in a dynamically distributed environment.

TI RAIN: A Bio-Inspired Communication and Data Storage Infrastructure
SO ARTIFICIAL LIFE
AB We summarize the results and perspectives from a companion article, where we presented and evaluated an alternative architecture for data storage in distributed networks. We name the bio-inspired architecture RAIN, and it offers file storage service that, in contrast with current centralized cloud storage, has privacy by design, is open source, is more secure, is scalable, is more sustainable, has community ownership, is inexpensive, and is potentially faster, more efficient, and more reliable. We propose that a RAIN-style architecture could form the backbone of the Internet of Things that likely will integrate multiple current and future infrastructures ranging from online services and cryptocurrency to parts of government administration.

TI Five years experience on 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate in Lambert-Eaton
   syndrome
SO MEDICINE
AB Rationale: To report our experience on 7 patients (4 males and 3 females), affected by nonparaneoplastic Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, treated with 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate (3,4-DAPP) either alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants or steroids.
   Patient concerns: Patients have been evaluated at specific timepoints (ie, baseline and last 5 year follow-up), with neurological examination, autoantibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated Cav2.1 (P/Q type) calcium ion channel (VGCC) dosage, neurophysiological evaluation focusing on the increased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (cMAP) after maximum voluntary effort, quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) and activities of daily living scales, and autonomic nervous system involvement evaluation.
   Outcomes: Five out of 7 patients presented a clinical improvement persisting at last 5-year follow-up; 2 out of them improved taking only 3,4-DAPP at the maximal dosage, whereas the remaining received concomitant medications, such as prednisone and azathioprine. However, the clinical amelioration was not statistically significant. No one of the patients reported severe adverse events, except one, complaining of transient chin and perioral paresthesias. A significant association between QMG and the type of pharmacological drugs therapy (P=.028) emerged. Indeed, we observed an improvement of the clinical condition in all 3 subjects treated with 3,4-DAPP and prednisone.
   Conclusions: In this study, we confirm 3,4-DAPP treatment efficacy on muscle strength, but minor evidence of drug effectiveness have been demonstrated on the autonomic nervous system involvement and on the deep tendon reflexes reappearance, a part from patients who received 3,4-DAPP associated to prednisone.

TI Blockchain Ensures Transparency in Personal data Usage: Being Ready for
   the New EU General data Protection Regulation
SO ERCIM NEWS
AB The new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [1][L1], which will come into effect in 2018, demands transparency as one of the main principles for the collection, processing, storing and transfer of personal data. Transparency ensures that individuals can enforce their legal rights: to withdraw consent for their personal data to be processed or to request that their data are erased. At the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology we filed a patent, based on blockchain technology, that guarantees transparency in the context of files that are exchanged in a shared data pool. It guarantees that access by partners to specific files can be traced without a central entity.

AB Cloud services are becoming increasingly globalized and data-center workloads are expanding exponentially. GPU and FPGA-based clouds have illustrated improvements in power and performance by accelerating compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a promising way to optimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a given datacenter computation (e.g. YouTube transcoding) by reducing both energy consumption and marginal computation cost.
   The feasibility of an ASIC Cloud for a particular application is directly gated by the ability to manage the NonRecurring Engineering (NRE) costs of designing and fabricating the ASIC, so that it is significantly lower (e.g. 2 x) than the TCO of the best available alternative.
   In this paper, we show that technology node selection is a major tool for managing ASIC Cloud NRE, and allows the designer to trade off an accelerator's excess energy efficiency and cost performance for lower total cost. We explore NRE and cross-technology optimization of ASIC Clouds for four different applications: Bitcoin mining, YouTube-style video transcoding, Litecoin, and Deep Learning. We address these challenges and show large reductions in the NRE, potentially enabling ASIC Clouds to address a wider variety of datacenter workloads. Our results suggest that advanced nodes like 16nm will lead to sub-optimal TCO for many workloads, and that use of older nodes like 65nm can enable a greater diversity of ASIC Clouds.

TI Secure joint Bitcoin trading with partially blind fuzzy signatures
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Bitcoin has recently received considerable attentions in both academia and industrial areas. It is an appealing anonymous electronic cash system-based peer-to-peer computer networks and does not rely on any centralized trusted authority. The Bitcoin is associated with a public/secret key pair where the security key is only known by its Bitcoin account owner. It is usually hosted on some platform and can only be spent after its owner and the platform sign on it. In this paper, we investigate how to jointly manage the Bitcoin trading when the Bitcoin account is possessed by multiple participants and how to simultaneously guarantee the anonymity of the multiple owners. We first consider the scenario where a single dealer possesses the Bitcoin account but authorizes multiple participants to jointly manage it. For instance, a company authorizes its several departments to manage its account. We next consider the scenario where the Bitcoin account is shared by some peers, e.g., joint investigators each of whom independent possesses a part of the account. The main challenge is that the signers are uncertain in different transactions. We propose partially blind threshold signatures with uncertain signers and their extensions to address this challenge. Analysis shows that our proposals are secure and efficient.

TI Personality dimensions in schizophrenia: A family study
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB Studies have demonstrated that personality traits differ in schizophrenia patients and family members compared to controls, suggesting familial risk. This study evaluated personality traits in a family study of schizophrenia, as well as the relationship between personality traits and symptoms and social functioning in schizophrenia patients. Thirty-two schizophrenia patients, 28 adult non-psychotic relatives, and 27 community controls completed the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). Schizophrenia patients differed on many dimensions of the DAPP-BQ compared to controls and/or relatives: affective lability, anxiousness, callousness, conduct problems, cognitive dysregulation, identity problem, intimacy, insecure attachment, low affiliation, narcissism, oppositionality, restricted expression, self-harm, submissiveness, and suspiciousness. No differences were found between relatives and controls. Furthermore, in schizophrenia patients, associations were found between personality and particularly general symptoms, as well as social functioning. Personality traits can be conceptualized as an extended phenotype in schizophrenia patients.

This paper explores the extent to which digital currencies, such as Bitcoin or MazaCoin, might be used to facilitate Indigenous self-determination, political autonomy, and economic prosperity. Based on our review of the literature, we argue that cryptocurrencies demonstrate some potential for advancing these goals but that there are a number of potential roadblocks as well. Future research should investigate how Indigenous communities might use digital currencies and other related technologies to further their political, economic, and social goals.

CY OCT 20-22, 2016
CL Cheonan, SOUTH KOREA
AB Permissions usually cannot fulfill user requirements to determine security and privacy risks of Android smart phone applications. To provide users additional information about applications, this study proposes a blockchainbased reputation service for Android applications. The proposed reputation service provides a scheme to integrate reputation information about an application, such as comments, reviews, security analysis results and so on, around the world with tree structures. Therefore, people can send requests to perform query and update operations provided by the reputation service on the so called reputation information trees. Moreover, the proposed service adopts the blockchain technology used in the Bitcoin. Therefore, the service can be provided based on resources of application users and other volunteers. Consequently, we can prevent reputation information provided by the service from being controlled by a single party. Moreover, this study proposes a flexible means for application developers or marketplace providers to embed reputation information into applications to reduce the costs of obtaining the basic reputation information from the reputation service. Users can obtain reputation of applications from the application files directly and query advanced information from the reputation service on demand. While users can obtain more reputation information about applications, the study can hopefully contribute to enable users to understand application security and privacy risks.

AB Blockchain is one of the hottest topics in the discussion of technologies lately. As the enabling technology for Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, blockchain is an append only distributed ledger that is virtually impossible to attack given sufficient scale of participants. Hence, blockchain holds great promises as the fundamental technology to enable Internet-based electronic voting. However, Internet-based voting has additional requirements than monetary transactions. In this paper, we analyze these requirements, review existing proposed solutions, and outline possible improvements. Specifically, we propose to use live biometrics of the voter to perform secure and highly reliable remote authentication. We also propose a scheme to protect the secrecy of the ballots and eliminate the influence of votes already cast. Finally, we propose to impose a hierarchy to the voting infrastructure that aligns naturally with traditional voting, which enables parallel processing of multiple blockchains, to overcome the intrinsic scalability limitation of the blockchain technology.

AB Real world physical shopping offers customers the privilege of maintaining their privacy by giving them the option of using cash, and thus providing no personal information such as their names and home addresses. On the contrary, electronic shopping mandates the use of all sorts of personally identifiable information for both billing and shipping purposes. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created a stimulated growth in private billing by enabling pseudonymous payments. However, the anonymous delivery of the purchased physical goods is still an open research problem. In this work, we present a blockchain-based physical delivery system called Lelantos(1) that within a realistic threat model, offers customer anonymity, fair exchange and merchant-customer unlinkability. Our system is inspired by the onion routing techniques which are used to achieve anonymous message delivery. Additionally, Lelantos relies on the decentralization and pseudonymity of the blockchain to enable pseudonymity that is hard to compromise, and the distributed consensus mechanisms provided by smart contracts to enforce fair irrefutable transactions between distrustful contractual parties.

There is an active attempt to successfully implement blockchain based systems which ensures that the IT systems are immutable, double spending is avoided and cryptographic strength is provided to them. A successful implementation of blockchain as backbone of existing information technology systems is bound to eliminate various types of fraud and ensure quicker delivery of the item on trade. To adapt IT systems to blockchain architecture, an efficient consensus algorithm need to be designed. Blockchain based on proof of work first came up as the backbone of cryptocurrency. After this, several other methods with variety of interesting features have come up. In this paper, we conduct a survey on existing attempts to achieve consensus in block chain. A federated consensus method and a proof of validation method are being compared.

AB Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms which restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation.

AB A distributed and tamper proof media transaction framework is proposed based on the blockchain model. Current multimedia distribution does not preserve self-retrievable information of transaction trails or content modification histories. For example, digital copies of valuable artworks, creative media and entertainment contents are distributed for various purposes including exhibitions, gallery collections or in media production workflow. Original media is often edited for creative content preparation or tampered with to fabricate false propaganda over social media. However there is no existing trusted mechanism that can easily retrieve either the transaction trails or the modification histories. We propose a novel watermarking based Multimedia Blockchain framework that can address such issues. The unique watermark information contains two pieces of information: a) a cryptographic hash that contains transaction histories (blockchain transactions log) and b) an image hash that preserves retrievable original media content. Once the watermark is extracted, first part of the watermark is passed to a distributed ledger to retrieve the historical transaction trail and the latter part is used to identify the edited / tampered regions. The paper outlines the requirements, the challenges and demonstrates the proof of this concept.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a peer-to-peer payment system, where transactions directly take place between pseudo-anonymous users, without any centralised authority. Since the block-chain (i.e., the public ledger where transactions are registered) is an example of Big Data, a straightforward visualisation is not very informative. For this reason, we employ techniques from Visual Analytics to filter out undesired information in order to obtain a tool to visually analyse the transactions and help its analysis. For instance, different views can highlight miners, or sources and leaves of bitcoin flows, together with the balance of each address and transaction. Moreover, the main view sees transactions as grouped into disconnected "islands", making it possible to focus on only one of them at once.

AB The rapidly growing design complexity has become a big obstacle and dramatically increased the time required for SystemC simulation. In this case study, we exploit different levels of parallelism, including thread-and data-level parallelism, to accelerate the simulation of a Bitcoin miner model in SystemC. Our experiments are performed on two multi-core processors and one many-core Intel (R) Xeon Phi (TM) Coprocessor. Our results show that with the combination of data-and thread-level parallelism, the peak simulation speed improves by over 11x on a 4-core host, 50x on a 16-core host, and 510x on a 60-core host, respectively. The results confirm the efficiency of combining thread-and data-level parallelism for higher SystemC simulation speed, and can serve as a benchmark for future optimization of system level design, modeling, and simulation.

AB The Internet of Things is gaining momentum thanks to the provided vision of seamlessly inter-connected devices. However, a unified way to discover and to interact with the surrounding smart environment is missing. As an outcome, we have been assisting to the development of heterogeneous ecosystems, where each service provider adopts its own protocol-thus preventing IoT devices from interacting when belonging to different providers. And, the same is happening again for the blockchain technology which provides a robust and trusted way to accomplish tasks-unfortunately not providing interoperability thus creating the same heterogeneous ecosystems above highlighted.
   In this context, the fundamental research question we address is how do we find things or services in the Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose the first IoT discovery approach which provides an answer to the above question by exploiting hierarchical and universal multi-layered blockchains. Our approach does neither define new standards nor force service providers to change their own protocol. On the contrary, it leverages the existing and publicly available information obtained from each single blockchain to have a better knowledge of the surrounding environment. The proposed approach is detailed and discussed with the support of relevant use cases.

AB As a decentralized and distributed secure storage technology, the notion of blockchain is now widely used for electronic trading in finance, for issuing digital certificates, for copyrights management, and for many other security-critical applications. With applications in so many domains with high-assurance requirements, the formalization and verification of safety and security properties of blockchain becomes essential, and the aim of the present paper. We present the model-based formalization, simulation and verification of a blockchain protocol by using the SDL formalism of Telelogic Tau. We consider the hierarchical and modular SDL model of the blockchain protocol and exercise a methodology to formally simulate and verify it. This way, we show how to effectively increase the security and safety of blockchain in order to meet high assurance requirements demanded by its application domains. Our work also provides effective support for assessing different network consensus algorithms, which are key components in blockchain protocols, as well as on the topology of blockchain networks. In conclusion, our approach contributes to setting up a verification methodology for future blockchain standards in digital trading.

AB When Bitcoin was first introduced to the world in 2008 by an enigmatic programmer going by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, it was billed as the world's first decentralized virtual currency. Offering the first credible incarnation of a digital currency, Bitcoin was based on the principal of peer to peer transactions involving a complex public address and a private key that only the owner of the coin would know. This paper will seek to investigate how the usage and value of Bitcoin is affected by current events in the cyber environment. Is an advancement in the digital security of Bitcoin reflected by the value of the currency and conversely does a major security breech have a negative effect? By analyzing statistical data of the market value of Bitcoin at specific points where the currency has fluctuated dramatically, it is believed that trends can be found. This paper proposes that based on the data analyzed, the current integrity of the Bitcoin security is trusted by general users and the value and usage of the currency is growing. All the major fluctuations of the currency can be linked to significant events within the digital security environment however these fluctuations are beginning to decrease in frequency and severity. Bitcoin is still a volatile currency but this paper concludes that this is a result of security flaws in Bitcoin services as opposed to the Bitcoin protocol itself.

AB Smart Cities depend on data from numerous different sources to live up to their full potential. Adding personal data from private sources to a smart city's resources significantly increases this potential. Sustainable utilisation of such data must base on legal compliancy, ethical soundness, and consent of the providing data subjects. They have to be assured that their personal data will not be used for anything beyond the scope they agreed to, and that it will not suffer from any additional risk exposure. For this we propose a solution for self-determined data subjects (SDDS), which keeps the private and personal data at their decentralized, safe locations, without depriving the smart city from the information contained within. SDDS achieves this with strict compartmentalization of its different system elements, by exclusively storing non-mnemonic indices and IDs in a public ledger, and by sending mere analytical results, yet no original data across the network. Such a setup ensures the data subjects' privacy, grants the smart city access to a high number of new data sources, and simultaneously handles the user-consent to ensure compliance with data protection laws.

AB Identity systems today link users to all of their actions and serve as centralized points of control and data collection. NEXTLEAP proposes an alternative decentralized and privacy-enhanced architecture. First, NEXTLEAP is building privacy-enhanced federated identity systems, using blind signatures based on Algebraic MACs to improve OpenID Connect. Second, secure messaging applications ranging from Signal to WhatsApp may deliver the content in an encrypted form, but they do not protect the metadata of the message and they rely on centralized servers. The EC Project NEXTLEAP is focussed on fixing these two problems by decentralizing traditional identities onto a privacy-enhanced based blockchain that can then be used to build access control lists in a decentralized manner, similar to SDSI. Furthermore, we improve on secure messaging by then using this notion of decentralized identity to build in group messaging, allowing messaging between different servers. NEXTLEAP is also working with the PANORAMIX EC project to use a generic mix networking infrastructure to hide the metadata of the messages themselves and plans to add privacy-enhanced data analytics that work in a decentralized manner.

AB Used mainly for the virtual money, the Blockchain technology adopts a decentralized network of peers to ensure a secure and transparent information storage and transmission. The basic use of Blockchain can be bypassed, and it is interesting to integrate it into other fields such as the Cloud storage. Cloud storage solutions ensure a continuous data synchronization and guarantee data sharing between different users. However, sharing user side encrypted data raises key and access control management challenges. Within this paper, we propose a novel access control model called Timely CP-ABE. Two main features come with our model. First, we introduce a decentralized access control mechanism where the user legitimacy is verified by Blockchain nodes. Second, we add temporal dimension to file sharing based on CP-ABE. In fact, we introduce a validity time to the access authorization without additional revocation cost. As a proof of concept, the implementation of the Timely CP-ABE based on Blockchain is performed on the CP-ABE toolkit and Multichain solution.

AB Bitcoin is a new form of global digital currency based on peer-to-peer network, enabling a new payment system, and also a completely decentralised cryptocurrency. The P2P network consists of a digital file listing transactions like a ledger, a copy of which is also maintained on every computer on the network, and the transactions are also broadcasted in the public ledger of the Bitcoin network. Anonymity is the core feature that makes Bitcoin popular among people around the world. This feature is attained through the Bitcoin addresses in the public ledger, which represents the users in the Bitcoin network. Because of the illicit use of Bitcoins, the level of anonymity has reduced even though the users are still using the anonymizers like TOR to keep the anonymity stronger to connect to the Bitcoin network. In this paper, we analyse the complete process of transaction of Bitcoins and the anonymity thatlies in that process. The study also focuses on finding the forensic artefacts and the investigative way of approach towards the Bitcoin using forensic tools. The forensic tools are used to analyse the web browser activities, local drive, hard disk image, cookies, downloads and session data related to Bitcoins. The attacker can relate the transaction of the users and can control the Bitcoin blocks by even delaying the transactions. This research will focus on the methods in which the memory and even mobile devices involved in the transaction could be captured and analysed.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized currency system that does not need any central authorities. All transactions issued by users have been recorded in the common ledger, called blockchain, which is shared by all users. In Bitcoin, an SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) client, which is a lightweight client that does not possess the entire blockchain, are developed for storage constrained devices such as a mobile phone. For an SPV client to check if there are transactions related to it, a Bloom filter where their Bitcoin addresses are involved is sent to a full client that possesses the entire blockchain. The full client only transfers transactions of which Bitcoin addresses are positive on the received Bloom filter. However, it is necessary to preserve the privacy of SPV clients when designing a Bloom filter because SPV clients' Bitcoin addresses will be identified by a full client with high probability. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving Bloom filter design for SPV clients based on gamma-Deniability. gamma-Deniability is a privacy metric that shows how much true positive Bitcoin addresses are hidden by the false positives in a Bloom filter. Furthermore, in order to design a Bloom Filter that satisfies a certain gamma-Deniability, it is necessary to know the number of unique Bitcoin addresses that appear for the first time since the queried time. Based on our manual inspection, we propose to estimate it based on the linear regression. We show that our scheme achieves good estimation accuracy and gamma through the simulation with a real Bitcoin blockchain.

AB Various pieces of personal information are correlated to the My Number program, which establishes national identification numbers that are unique to each citizen and resident of Japan. Hence, its protection is paramount. However, whereas the aim of current security measures is to prevent leaks directly, we must consider the possibility of non-secret information being used to indirectly leak secret information by inference. We studied a hypergraph-based model that is used to prevent the possibility of information leaks by inference. Only reading operations are considered in our previous works. However, writing operations have to be considered. We propose covert channel analysis models with inference rules and reading and writing operations. In addition, management mechanisms for the history of accesses to objects by users are required to analysis the satisfaction of the inference rules. If the history of accesses are altered, the information leakages by the inference attack are occurred. In our research, a block chain is used to manage the access log to solve problems mentioned above. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic access control model with access log managed by the blockchain and the inference path detection model.

AB The article attempts to identify the formal and essential features of the modern virtual currency, to provide a classification of virtual currencies, to identify the main factors influencing the demand and supply of virtual currencies, to analyze the key indicators of development of virtual currency schemes to determine their market prospects in payment system.
   The study determined that virtual currencies differ from traditional currencies and electronic money in the narrow sense. The main innovations related to the development of schemes of virtual currency are two key elements: the asset factor and payment factor. The main criteria for the classification of virtual currencies are: 1) the ability to convert virtual currency to traditional currency; 2) the organizational and technological features of the issue of virtual currencies.
   The study identified the main advantages of using virtual currencies for payment participants: 1) relatively short time for verification and settlement of payment transactions; 2) the high anonymity pf payment transactions; 3) relatively low transaction costs. However, currently only a few of decentralized schemes of virtual currencies are original from the point of view of a cryptographic scheme of issuing and accounting currency units. Among the virtual currencies with the highest market capitalization in the world are: Bitcoin, Litecoin and Reeple. Refs 32. Figs 5. Tables 3.

TI TAX CONSEQUENCES OF USING ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF PAYMENT (THEORETICAL AND
   LEGAL ASPECTS)
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-JURIDICHESKIE NAUKI
AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the analysis of the legal nature of alternative means of payment (for the purposes of taxation), in particular bitcoin, and to the study of tax consequences of their usage (theoretical and legal aspects). The academic interest of the authors is connected with law enforcement problems, which take their origin in unique technologies making it possible to use alternative means of payment. The paper analyzes the position of the Federal Tax Service of Russia on the issue, as well as foreign experience and current case law of the European Court of Justice. Purpose: to study the legal nature of alternative means of payment, bitcoin in particular, for the purposes of taxation; based on the analysis of foreign legal regulation experience, to reveal the most common problems in the field of taxation linked with the usage of virtual currencies and their tax assessment. Methods: the study is based on the methods of comparison, analysis, synthesis, generalization, and formal-logical method. Results: the article provides the analysis of the legal nature of alternative means of payment, in particular bitcoin, for the purposes of legal entities income tax and VAT; the substantiation for the conclusion that operations with bitcoin are subject to taxation; the analysis of tax consequences of particular situations; the formulation of the main principles of taxation. Conclusions: the scientific research conducted confirms that the national regulators and fiscal authorities are only at the stage of thinking over problems arising in virtual reality, including those connected with the usage of virtual currencies. There is an urgent need for legal regulation of relations which arise from transactions with cryptocurrencies. The majority of states are not ready to exclude persons using bitcoins, as well as trading platforms gaining income from the relevant transactions from the scope of potential taxpayers. Operations with bitcoins do not refer to currency operations; the authors deem it well-founded to regard (for the purposes of in-ations of the barter nature. When defining VAT taxation principles, it is reasonable to take into consideration the specificity of bitcoins as "virtual goods", which combine a number of features common for services and means of payment, determining the specifics of their taxation in comparison with real goods and services.

AB The increasing automation and capacity of communication of industrial systems brings new possibilities and challenges to the sector. We investigate a problem of distributed and collective supply and discuss solutions to the issue of fair and reliable decision making in open systems. By combining principles of social organisation with blockchain and smart-contract technologies, we show that it is possible to develop a system for common-pool resource management able to take quick decisions on an industrial scale, while ensuring cooperation and self-organising strategies that encourage compliance. Our results demonstrate that our model - the Smart-CPR - is able to distribute resources efficiently and is capable of detecting and punishing non-compliant or unhelpful behaviour.

TI Funding Science with Science: Cryptocurrency and Independent Academic
   Research Funding
SO LEDGER
AB Scientific funding within the academy is an often complicated affair involving disparate and competing interests. Private universities, for instance, are vastly outpacing public institutions in garnering large, prestigious, science-related grants and external research investment. Inequities also extend to the types of research funded, with government, corporate, and even military interests privileging certain types of inquiry. This article proposes an innovative type of science research fund using cryptocurrencies, a fast-growing asset class. Although not a total funding solution, staking coins, specifically, can be strategically invested in to yield compound interest. These coins use masternode technologies to collateralize the network and speed transaction pace and may pay dividends to masternode holders, allowing institutions that purchase these types of central hubs to potentially engage in a lucrative form of dividend reinvestment. Using cryptocurrencies as a new funding stream may garner large amounts of capital and creation of nonprofit institutes to support the future of funding scientific research within educational institutions.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, widely used for its perceived anonymity property, and has surged in popularity in recent years. Bitcoin publishes the complete transaction history in a public ledger, under pseudonyms of users. This is an alternative way to prevent double-spending attack instead of central authority. Therefore, if pseudonyms of users are attached to their identities in real world, the anonymity of Bitcoin will be a serious vulnerability. It is necessary to enhance anonymity of Bitcoin by a coin mixing service or other modifications in Bitcoin protocol. But in a coin mixing service, the relationship among input and output addresses is not hidden from the mixing service provider. So the mixing server still has the ability to track the transaction records of Bitcoin users. To solve this problem, We present a new coin mixing scheme to ensure that the relationship between input and output addresses of any users is invisible for the mixing server. We make use of a ring signature algorithm to ensure that the mixing server can't distinguish specific transaction from all these addresses. The ring signature ensures that a signature is signed by one of its users in the ring and doesn't leak any information about who signed it. Furthermore, the scheme is fully compatible with existing Bitcoin protocol and easily to scale for large amount of users.

AB With the rapid development of Bitcoin, it is frequently used in the scene of fast payment. But the strategy which Bitcoin takes to prevent the double-spending attack is waiting for six confirmations (about one hour), this is not suitable for the fast payment scenarios where service time is about tens of seconds. The default strategy in fast payment is that do not offer the service until a payment transaction is added to the wallet of vendor, which is useless for the detection of double-spending attack. In this paper, an immune-based model is proposed to detect the double-spending attack in the fast Bitcoin payment. This model is composed of many immune-based Bitcoin nodes which include a detection modula and a traditional node. Antigen character is first extracted from a transaction by the detection modula, and initial detectors (mature detectors) are generated based on these antigens. Then, memory detectors and mature detectors are used to detect the double-spending attack, and a mature detector which matches an attack will evolve into a memory detector and be delivered to other immune-based nodes in the Bitcoin network, in order to rapidly detect the double-spending attack. Experimental result shows that this model can efficiently detect double-spending attacks in fast Bitcoin payment.

AB Thing-to-thing payments are a key enabler in the Internet of Things (IoT) era, to ubiquitously allow for devices to pay each other for services without any human interaction. Traditional credit card-based systems are not able to handle this new paradigm, however blockchain technology is a promising payment candidate in this context. The prominent example of blockchain technology is Bitcoin, with its decentralized structure and ease of account creation. This paper presents a proof-of-concept implementation of a smart cable that connects to a smart socket and without any human interaction pays for electricity. In this paper, we identify several obstacles for the widespread use of bitcoins in thing-to-thing payments. A critical problem is the high transaction fees in the Bitcoin network when doing micro transactions. To reduce this impact, we present a single-fee micro-payment protocol that aggregates multiple smaller payments incrementally into one larger transaction needing only one transaction fee. The proof-of concept shows that trustless, autonomous, and ubiquitous thing-to-thing micro-payments is no longer a future technology.

AB BIP70 is a community-accepted Payment Protocol standard that governs how merchants and customers perform payments in Bitcoin. This standard is supported by most major wallets and the two dominant Payment Processors: Coinbase and BitPay, who collectively provide the infrastructure for accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment to more than 100,000 merchants. In this paper, we present new attacks on the Payment Protocol, which affect all BIP70 merchants. The Silkroad Trader attack highlights an authentication vulnerability in the Payment Protocol while the Marketplace Trader attack exploits the refund policies of existing Payment Processors. Both attacks have been experimentally verified on real-life merchants using a modified Bitcoin wallet. The attacks have been acknowledged by both Coinbase and Bitpay with temporary mitigation measures put in place. However, to fully address the identified issues will require revising the BIP70 standard. We present a concrete proposal to revise BIP70 by providing the merchant with publicly verifiable evidence to prevent both attacks.

AB The Bitcoin whitepaper [1] states that security of the system is guaranteed as long as honest miners control more than half of the current total computational power. The whitepaper assumes a static difficulty, thus it is equally hard to solve a cryptographic proof-of-work puzzle for any given moment of system history. However, the real Bitcoin network is using an adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism.
   In this paper we introduce and analyze a new kind of attack on the mining difficulty retargeting function used in Bitcoin which we call "coin-hopping". In a coin-hopping attack, a malicious miner increases his mining profits while at the same time increasing the average delay between blocks.
   We propose an alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm in order to reduce the incentive to perform a coin-hopping attack, and also decrease inter-block delays. Finally, we evaluate our proposed approach and show how its novel algorithm performs better than the original algorithm of Bitcoin.

This one-day workshop will explore the implications of emerging and future technologies using the lens of Distributed Autonomous Organisations (DAOs). DAOs introduce the principle that products and services may soon be owned and managed collectively and not by one person or authority, thus challenging traditional concepts of user communities, ownership and power. The HCI community has recently explored issues related to finance, money and collaborative practice; however, the implications of these emerging but rapidly ascending distributed organisations has not been examined. This one-day participatory workshop will combine presentations, case studies and group work sessions to understand, develop and critique these new forms of distributed power and ownership, and to practically explore how to design interactive products and services which enable, challenge or disrupt these emerging models.

AB Remote attestation is used to enable verifiers to check if an underlying Trusted Computing Base TCB) of a device and data from the TCB are trustworthy. However, the current remote attestation has limitations to be deployed in IoT from the perspective of the management in a massive and diverse collection of TCB measurements and the redundant execution of remote attestation. To mitigate these limitations, we present a trustworthy management of TCB measurements called TM-Coin TCB Measurement-Coin) using the blockchain and ARM TrustZone. The TM-Coin transactions and protocol are presented to manage the TCB measurements of IoT devices using the blockchain, a decentralized database. The trusted execution environment provided by ARM TrustZone is used as the TCB to generate the TM-Coin transactions securely. Based on TM-Coin, the verifiers launch remote attestation of sensed data from the devices using the TCB measurements published in the blockchain without attesting to the TCB. We implemented a prototype to evaluate the performance overhead caused by TM-Coin.

We then present a simplified proof of Nakamoto's blockchain which we recommend for pedagogical purposes. Finally, we survey recent results including how to avoid well-known painpoints in permissionless consensus, and how to apply core ideas behind blockchains to solve consensus in the classical, permissioned setting and meanwhile achieve new properties that are not attained by classical approaches.

AB The potential of visualizations for negotiating and representing contracts has been explored in current research around the innovation of law. Visualizations help to increase transparency of legal matters and contribute not only to a better understanding of agreements, but to the overall deal-design. We propose a visualized simulation displaying the outcomes of complex start-up investment agreements at various points in the future. By capturing the standard variables of start-up financing term-sheets, the system supports the pre-negotiation phase between entrepreneurs and investors. Relying on the agent-based modeling framework NetLogo, we facilitate dynamic simulations with parties entering their own priorities and assumptions about the other side. We believe such a tool could prove useful on crowd-funding platforms with their increase of investor-founder relationships. In further research, specific contracts may be tested with populations of entrepreneurs and investors, yielding insights on the desirability of various deal structures.

In the world of Internet of things, we can build very interesting concepts of use with these new technologies. This paper is focused on related issues for new complex solutions and implementation in enterprise world. In this regard, I first provide a brief overview of the core aspects of these technologies, as well as the smart contracts-based developments for Internet of things. I discuss key issues that must be considered in developing such as blockchain-based technologies in Internet of things context. The result of this effort is to show that future Internet of things application allows the contingency of future events to be more robustly orchestrated through smart contracts.

AB This paper conducts a performance analysis of two popular private blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum (private deployment), to assess the performance and limitations of these state-of-the-art platforms. Blockchain, a decentralized transaction and data management technology, is said to be the technology that will have similar impacts as the Internet had on people's lives. Many industries have become interested in adopting blockchain in their IT systems, but scalability is an often-cited concern of current blockchain technology. Therefore, the goals of this preliminary performance analysis are twofold. First, a methodology for evaluating a blockchain platform is developed. Second, the analysis results are presented to inform practitioners in making decisions regarding adoption of blockchain technology in their IT systems. The experimental results, based on varying number of transactions, show that Hyperledger Fabric consistently outperforms Ethereum across all evaluation metrics which are execution time, latency and throughput. Additionally, both platforms are still not competitive with current database systems in term of performances in high workload scenarios.

AB Ransomware attacks have become a global incidence, with the primary aim of making monetary gains through illicit means. The attack started through e-mails and has expanded through spamming and phishing. Ransomware encrypts targets' files and display notifications, requesting for payment before the data can be unlocked. Ransom demand is usually in form of virtual currency, bitcoin, because it is difficult to track. In this paper, we give a brief overview of the current trend, challenges, and research progress in the bid to finding lasting solutions to the menace of ransomware that currently challenge computer and network security, and data privacy.

AB The profitability of fraud in online systems such as app markets and social networks marks the failure of existing defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose FraudSys, a real-time fraud preemption approach that imposes Bitcoin-inspired computational puzzles on the devices that post online system activities, such as reviews and likes. We introduce and leverage several novel concepts that include (i) stateless, verifiable computational puzzles, that impose minimal performance overhead, but enable the efficient verification of their authenticity, (ii) a real-time, graph based solution to assign fraud scores to user activities, and (iii) mechanisms to dynamically adjust puzzle difficulty levels based on fraud scores and the computational capabilities of devices. FraudSys does not alter the experience of users in online systems, but delays fraudulent actions and consumes significant computational resources of the fraudsters. Using real datasets from Google Play and Facebook, we demonstrate the feasibility of FraudSys by showing that the devices of honest users are minimally impacted, while fraudster controlled devices receive daily computational penalties of up to 3,079 hours. In addition, we show that with FraudSys, fraud does not pay off, as a user equipped with mining hardware (e.g., AntMiner S7) will earn less than half through fraud than from honest Bitcoin mining.

AB While online services emerge in all areas of life, the voting procedure in many democracies remains paper-based as the security of current online voting technology is highly disputed. We address the issue of trustworthy online voting protocols and recall therefore their security concepts with its trust assumptions. Inspired by the Bitcoin protocol, the prospects of distributed online voting protocols are analysed. No trusted authority is assumed to ensure ballot secrecy. Further, the integrity of the voting is enforced by all voters themselves and without a weakest link, the protocol becomes more robust. We introduce a taxonomy of notions of distribution in online voting protocols that we apply on selected online voting protocols. Accordingly, blockchain-based protocols seem to be promising for online voting due to their similarity with paper-based protocols.

AB In the past few years, the number of wireless devices connected to the Internet has increased to a number that could reach billions in the next few years. While cloud computing is being seen as the solution to process this data, security challenges could not be addressed solely with this technology. Security problems will continue to increase with such a model, especially for private and sensitive data such as data personal and medical data collected with more and more sophisticated connected devices (forming the IoT). Thus the need for a fully decentralized peer to peer and secure technology to overcome these problems. The blockchain Technology is a promising approach giving the properties it brings to the field. This paper illustrates an architecture based on blockchain technology, and a protocol for data access, using smart contracts and a publisher-subscriber mechanism.

AB Achieving efficient and secure resource discovery in the intercloud remains non-trivial. Several peer-to-peer based resource discovery schemes have been proposed by researchers apart from industry bodies such as the Global Inter Cloud Technology Forum (GICTF). The challenges with these distributed schemes include peer-selection, trust/reputation management, transaction record management and financial settlements besides handling failures. We propose a P2P-based resource discovery framework using blockchain which addresses several of the key shortcomings of existing approaches. The proposed framework scores over existing schemes on several functional and performance parameters. It is the first instance of applying the blockchain concept to the intercloud resource discovery process circumventing the need of a trusted third-party or broker between participating Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

AB The large number of personal wireless devices in the urban areas could be used to provide various opportunistic data services, such as WiFi sharing, content-based file sharing and opportunistic networking. In order to facilitate these services, it is essential to incentivise the device owners to become service providers. However, previous research failed to deliver any practical payment systems for opportunistic data services. Inspired by smart contracts functionalities of bitcoin, this paper proposes a payment system named OPPay for opportunistic data services, which implements a micropayment communication protocol for mobile devices to perform data transactions and make payments using bitcoin. The system is designed to make incremental payments and thus resilient to interrupted communications caused by human 'nobility in the mobile network. By implementing and evaluating the system for three different applications, we show that the system is able to work in heterogeneous hardware and software enviromnents and can achieve fast transactions confirmation with small fee overhead and low faulty payment value.

AB Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are recently gaining wide adoption since the introduction of Bitcoin, being distributed, authority-free, and secure. Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as "useless", and the used intensive computations are considered "waste" of energy. A myriad of Proof of "something" alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the "work" remained far from being really "useful". In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more "rational" solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.

AB This paper explores the relationship between the features of Bitcoin and the next day change in the price of Bitcoin using an Artificial Neural Network ensemble approach called Genetic Algorithm based Selective Neural Network Ensemble, constructed using Multi-Layered Perceptron as the base model for each of the neural network in the ensemble.
   To better understand the practicality and its effectiveness in real-world application, the ensemble was used to predict the next day direction of the price of Bitcoin given a set of approximately 200 features of the cryptocurrency over a span of 2 years.
   Over a span of 50 days, a trading strategy based on the ensemble was compared against a "previous day trend following" trading strategy through back-testing. The former trading strategy generated almost 85% returns, outperforming the "previous day trend following" trading strategy which produced an approximate 38% returns and a trading strategy that follows the single, best MLP model in the ensemble that generated approximately 53% in returns.

AB The blockchain technology seems to be regarded by many, as a revolution, on the scale comparable to the advent of the Internet. The blockchain by itself is a rather simple data structure. The cryptocurrency design details account for the security of the underlying system. In this work, we present the design of our cryptographic system for use in Smart Grid environments. The mechanism is to incentivize distribution of greenfield energy, but also, to handle and encourage the required data transmission and storage. In our design, value of the cryptocurrency, as well as, of the energy itself, is determined solely by forces of supply and demand. Our design is unique in that, Smart Meters are the only trusted actors. We stress the importance of features required by, such a system; to be regarded as secure, distributed and indeed decentralized. We advocate, that a smart-meter is the only element required to be trusted; and that should hold true only in regard to making energy measurements. We show, why a cryptocurrency based system, which we have designed, is particularly suitable for energy-distribution scenarios, especially in limited-trust environments, where anonymity and security of data transmission are of the essence. Our hereby proposed system provides a fully distributed market for prosumers, costumers, power line owners and any other entities involved in both energy and data distribution. In this paper we focus on the architectural design.

AB A blockchain is a distributed transaction ledger, a disruptive technology that creates new possibilities for digital ecosystems. The blockchain ecosystem maintains an immutable transaction record to support many types of digital services. This paper compares the performance and scalability of a web-based groupware communication application using both non-blockchain and blockchain technologies. Scalability is measured where message load is synthesized over two typical communication topologies. The first is 1 to n network - a typical client-server or star-topology with a central vertex (server) receiving all messages from the remaining n - 1 vertices (clients). The second is a more naturally occurring scale-free network topology, where multiple communication hubs are distributed throughout the network. System performance is tested with both blockchain and non-blockchain solutions using multiple cloud computing configurations. We analyze the empirical results from each configuration to identify the costs and overhead of blockchain technology.

TI THE FUTURE OF E-VOTING
SO IADIS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Voting systems have been around for hundreds of years and despite different views on their integrity, have always been deemed secure with some fundamental security and anonymity principles. Numerous electronic systems have been proposed and implemented but some suspicion has been raised regarding the integrity of elections due to detected security vulnerabilities within these systems. Electronic voting, to be successful, requires a more transparent and secure approach, than is offered by current protocols. The approach presented in this paper involves a protocol developed on blockchain technology. The underlying technology used in the voting system is a payment scheme, which offers anonymity of transactions, a trait not seen in blockchain protocols to date. The proposed protocol offers anonymity of voter transactions, while keeping the transactions private, and the election transparent and secure. The underlying payment protocol has not been modified in any way, the voting protocol merely offers an alternative use case.

AB Although Bitcoin is one of the most successful decentralized cryptocurrency, recent research has revealed that it can be used as fraudulent activities such as HYIP (High Yield Investment Program). To identify such undesired activities, it is important to obtain Bitcoin addresses related with fraud. So far, the identification of such activities is based upon relating Bitcoin addresses with graph mining procedures. In this paper, we follow a different approach for identifying Bitcoin addresses related with HYIP by analyzing transactions patterns. In particular, based on the individual inspection of HYIP activity in Bitcoin, we propose a number of features that can be extracted from transactions. In particular, a signed integer called pattern is assigned to each transaction and the frequency of each pattern is calculated as key features. By evaluating the classification performance with more than 1,500 labeled Bitcoin addresses, it is shown that about 83% of HYIP addresses are correctly classified while maintaining false positive rate less than 4.4%.

AB Pinocchio is a practical zk-SNARK that allows a prover to perform cryptographically verifiable computations with verification effort potentially less than performing the computation itself. A recent proposal showed how to make Pinocchio adaptive (or "hash-and-prove"), i.e., to enable proofs with respect to computation-independent commitments. This enables computations to be chosen after the commitments have been produced, and for data to be shared between different computations in a flexible way. Unfortunately, this proposal is not zero-knowledge. In particular, it cannot be combined with Trinocchio, a system in which Pinocchio is outsourced to three workers that do not learn the inputs thanks to multi-party computation (MPC). In this paper, we show how to make Pinocchio adaptive in a zero-knowledge way; apply this to make Trinocchio work on computation-independent commitments; present tooling to easily program flexible verifiable computations (with or without MPC); and use it to build a prototype in a medical research case study.

The use of blockchain technology in wired business environments, such as digital currency systems, offers an interesting solution by creating a way to maintain a distributed shared ledger without requiring a single trusted authority. In this paper, we discuss how a blockchain-based system can be modified to provide a solution for dynamic asset sharing amongst coalition members, enabling the creation of a logically centralized asset management system by a seamless policy-compliant federation of different coalition systems. We discuss the use of blockchain for three different types of assets in a coalition context, showing how blockchain can offer a suitable solution for sharing assets in those environments. We also discuss the limitations in the current implementations of blockchain which need to be overcome for the technology to become more effective in a decentralized tactical edge environment.

AB The 2008 financial crisis had scattered incredulity around the globe regarding traditional financial systems, which made investors and non-financial customers turn to other alternative such as digital banking systems. The existence and development of blockchain technology make cryptocurrency in recent years believably become a complete alternative to traditional ones. Bitcoin is the world's first peer-to-peer and decentralized digital cash system initiated by Nakamoto [1]. Though being the most prominent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has not been a legal trading currency in various countries. Its exchange rate has appeared to be an exceptionally high-risk portfolio with extreme volatility, which requires a more detailed evaluation before making any decision. This paper utilizes knowledge of statistics for financial time series and machine learning to (i) fit the parametric distribution and (ii) model and forecast the volatility of Bitcoin returns, and (iii) analyze its correlation to other financial market indicators. The fitted parametric time series model significantly outperforms other standard models in explaining the stylized facts and statistical variances in the behavior of Bitcoin returns. The model forecast also outperforms some machine learning methodologies, which would benefit policy makers, banks and financial investors in trading activities for both long-term and short-term strategies.

AB Breaches in online contracts (Service Level Agreements, SLAs) are usually compensated by gift vouchers at present, however as the online contracts emerge towards smart contracts, the breaches could potentially lead to court injunctions over blockchains. This research proposes Probability based Factor Model (PFM) that can be implemented over the blockchain to automatically identify breaches that can cause substantial damage and have high probability for recurrence. PFM can also issue court injunctions for the breaches. The underlying concept in PFM is built upon the notion of factor analysis and stochastic modeling from the discipline of Data Science. High performance computing (HPC) cluster at University of Luxembourg (HPC @ Uni.lu) and docker (a software container platform) were used to emulate contractual environment of three service providers: Redis, MongoDB, and Memcached Servers. The results showed that court injunction(s) was issued only for Redis and MongoDB Servers. Technically, this difference could be attributed to the fact that Memcached is simply used for caching and therefore, it is less prone to breach of contract. Whereas, Redis and MongoDB as databases and message brokers are performing more complex operations and are more likely to cause a breach. This research will benefit enterprises that view breach of contract as a limiting factor for implementation of smart contract in cyber-physical system or internet of things.

AB Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the main standard designed for secure connections over the Internet. Security of TLS connections against active Man-in-the-Middle attacks relies on correctly validating public-key certificates during TLS handshake authentication. Although Certificate Transparency (CT) and further improved CT system-IKP mitigated the certificate authentication issues from the perspective of monitoring CA misbehavior, less attentions have been paid to consider the misbehavior of domain in using certificates during TLS handshake authentication. One misusing case is that domains refuse to use the certificates in Certificate Transparency Log for their own profits, the other is that a malicious domain impersonates the real one to deceive clients. In order to defend against domain's misbehaviors in using certificates, we propose ETDA system based on IKP and CT aiming to enhance the security of TLS protocol from a novel perspective. ETDA is a blockchain-based system enforcing the automatic punishments in response to domain misbehavior and compensations to the client during TLS handshake authentication. The decentralized nature and incentives mechanism of ETDA provide an effective approach to prevent domains from sending invalid certificates to clients. We implement this system through Ethereum platform and Game Theory, which proved to be both technically and economically feasible.

AB The problem is discussed that large grid fluctuation caused by distributed generation integration, pointing out that the microgrid power local consumption is a solution to this problem. However, power transaction volume of electricity in microgrid is not large, while management has not simplified, and labor cost is high. The introduction of power market can solve local consumption problem of microgrid. Using blockchain technology can simplify the management of microgrid power transactions and realize peer-to-peer power transaction. Microgrid dispatch centers can also be simplified. The purpose of this paper is to explore applications of blockchain technology related to electricity market on microgrid and to present a framework how blockchain is employed to facilitate peer-to-peer electricity sales in microgrid.

AB The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm guarantees the safety and dependability of Blockchain systems. Miners can achieve a consensus through the PoW algorithm during the mining process, that is mutual attacking. However, when the miners attack each other, all miners earn less. In this paper, we established a model that mining between two miners is an iterative game, and proposed a subclass of ZD strategy (a pining strategy) to alleviate miners' dilemma, a miner can control another miner's payoff and increase the social revenue through a pinning strategy. Numerical simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. In summary, this work leads to the better understanding and analysis of the PoW algorithm via the game theory, rendering it possible to design a more rational consensus algorithm in the future.

AB FinTech, the phenomenon which spans over the areas of information technologies and financial innovation, is currently on the rise and is gaining more and more attention from practitioners, investors and researchers. FinTech is broadly discussed by the media, which constitutes its understanding and represents social opinion, however, this perception of FinTech should be supported by empirical evidences. Therefore, we examine five Swiss FinTech companies through the lens of the conceptual framework of understanding of FinTech and its dimensions and, by doing so, analyze the nature of FinTech innovations. Thereby, we extend the understanding of FinTech and provide a fruitful soil for further research in this area.

AB User authentication in computer systems has been a cornerstone of computer security for decades. However, the existing user authentication schemes either require human cognitive ability to remember numerous complex id and password, or rely on a trusted third party which could fail due to technical failure or denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we design a fully distributed user authentication framework with the blockchain technology. In our scheme, a user stores her identity in the blockchain, stores her encrypted personal information in a off-blockchain storage, and attaches a smart contract which grants different permissions to each website/application. When a user logs in a website/application, the service provider employs a challenge-response protocol to verify the identity of the user, and then retrieve the user's personal information from the off-blockchain storage.

AB Blockchain is a decentralized, trustless protocol that combines transparency, immutability, and consensus properties to enable secure, pseudo-anonymous transactions. Smart contracts are built atop a blockchain to support on-chain storage and enable Decentralized Apps (DApps) to interact with the blockchain programatically. Programmable blockchains have generated interest in the healthcare domain as a potential solution to resolve key challenges, such as gapped communications, inefficient clinical report delivery, and fragmented health records.
   This paper provides evaluation metrics to assess blockchain-based DApps in terms of their feasibility, intended capability, and compliance in the healthcare domain.

AB Because of the distributed nature of cloud computing, the data of cloud may be stored and processed across jurisdictional borders. In such case, collecting digital evidence from cloud computing requires multiparty cooperation. However, as far as we known, there is still no available technic approach for improving the trustworthy of the interaction records of all stakeholders in cloud forensics. This work proposed a process provenance, which provides proof of existence and privacy preservation for process records by using technologies of blockchain and cryptography group signature. The process provenance enhances the trustworthy of the chain of custody for cloud forensics.

AB Bitcoin, one major virtual currency, attracts users' attention by its novel mode in recent years. With blockchain as its basic technique, Bitcoin possesses strong security features which anonymizes user's identity to protect their private information. However, some criminals utilize Bitcoin to do several illegal activities bringing in great security threat to the society. Therefore, it is necessary to get knowledge of the current trend of Bitcoin and make effort to de-anonymize. In this paper, we put forward and realize a system to analyze Bitcoin from two aspects: blockchain data and network traffic data. We resolve the blockchain data to analyze Bitcoin from the point of Bitcoin address while simulate Bitcoin P2P protocol to evaluate Bitcoin from the point of IP address. At last, with our system, we finish analyzing its current trends and tracing its transactions by putting some statistics on Bitcoin transactions and addresses, tracing the transaction flow and de-anonymizing some Bitcoin addresses to IPs.

AB We address the problem of a trustless decentralised exchange of cryptocurrencies. Centralised exchanges are neither trustworthy nor secure. As of 2017, there has been more than 25 million US dollars' worth of cryptocurrencies stolen from (or by) centralised exchanges. With Coincer we allow any two users to exchange their diverse cryptocurrencies directly between them, yet with no need to trust each other. Former approaches either do not do without a server or rely on a trusted issuer of exchangeable tokens. Our approach is to fully eliminate any elements susceptible to becoming a single point of failure. Coincer therefore leverages an efficient anonymous P2P overlay and an atomic protocol for exchanging money across different cryptocurrencies. It is implemented as free software and has been successfully tested with Bitcoin and Litecoin.

AB The ASDEX Upgrade Discharge Control System (DCS) is a distributed real-time control system executing complex control and monitoring tasks. Up to now, DCS control algorithms have been implemented by coding dedicated application processes with the C++ programming language. Algorithm changes required code modification, compilation and commissioning which only experienced programmers could perform. This was a significant constraint of flexibility for both control system operation and design.
   The new approach extends DCS with the capability of configuration-defined control algorithms. These are composed of chains of small, configurable standard function blocks providing general purpose functions like algebraic operations, filters, feedback controllers, output limiters and decision logic. In a later phase a graphical editor could help to compose and modify such configuration in a Simulink-like fashion.
   Building algorithms from standard functions can result in a high number of elements. In order to achieve a similar performance as with C++ coding, it is essential to avoid administrative bottlenecks by design. As a consequence, DCS executes a function block chain in the context of a single real-time thread of an application process. No concurrency issues as in a multi-threaded context need to be considered resulting in strongly simplified signal handling and zero performance overhead for inter-block communication. Instead of signal-driven synchronization, a block scheduler derives the execution sequence automatically from the block dependencies as defined in the configuration. All blocks and connecting signals are instantiated dynamically, based on definitions in a configuration file. Algorithms thus are not defined in the code but only in the configuration.
   The concept has been developed in view of Simulink block libraries and MARTe General Application Modules (GAM) but extends these with the DCS virtues of distributed computing and multi-threading.
   With growing diversity of general-purpose blocks the DCS framework will reach an unprecedented degree of universality and flexibility. Configuration-defined algorithms will gradually replace many existing DCS applications. Finally, the concept might also become of interest for the upcoming ITER plasma control system.

TI Sound conflict management and resolution for virtual-enterprise
   collaborations
SO SERVICE ORIENTED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS
AB For fulfilling customer requests, enterprises are increasingly part of collaboration networks with peers. Such collaborations, also known as virtual enterprises (VE), are governed by pre-defined contracts that restrict the behaviour of each participating enterprise. However, since each enterprise is autonomous, the potential arises for conflicts during collaboration. In this paper, we extend our earlier work on virtual-enterprise modelling and address the existing gap of conflict modelling, management and resolution in VEs. Our approach works as follows: first, to detect a conflict by analysing the exceptions reported during execution; second, to uncover the conflict type, origin and impact of an exception; and third, depending on the nature of an exception, to implement the appropriate conflict negotiation and resolution strategy among the participating entities of a VE. Crucial to this approach, and serving as one of the key contributions of this paper, is the conflict ontology. This ontology helps to model conflict types along with related exceptions, negotiation and resolution strategies, thereby enabling conflict management and resolution. Throughout this paper, we illustrate our ideas with a running example and also present a detailed evaluation based on a case study from the automotive production domain.

It also means that it can be difficult for citizens to use their property as collateral for a mortgage, which hampers economic development. Building good and reliable land administration systems, however, can be a complicated and expensive activity. Now, a secure mechanism called blockchain, originally developed to handle and store transactions in the bitcoin digital currency, offers a chance for land administration by providing trust by definition.

AB To investigate validity of the dimensions that underlie pathological personality in adolescence, we delineated the hierarchical structure of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Short Form-Adolescent version (DAPP-SF-A; Tromp & Koot, 2008) and examined longitudinal associations with Big Five personality dimensions assessed four times from middle childhood to late adolescence. A total of 426 adolescents provided self-reports on the DAPP-SF-A (age M = 18.6, SD = 1.17; 53% female). Mothers provided information on their child's personality eleven, eight, five, and three years earlier. Previous findings on the hierarchical structure of the DAPP-BQ replicated up to the four-component solution (emotional dysregulation, dissocial behavior, inhibition, and compulsivity). In the solution, a thought disturbance component emerged. Interestingly, the five-component solution already showed most differentiated associations with childhood personality in middle childhood. Childhood personality dimensions predicted four out of five adolescent pathological personality traits, indicating continuity of normal and abnormal personality across childhood and adolescence.

Firstly, A SDN architecture based on ForCES is proposed. Then, based on the formalization of the concept of LFB and the traditional I/O matching algorithm, an LFB chain composition method is proposed. This method can combine a series of LFBs to an LFB chain according to special application request. Based on the LFB chain composition algorithm, an improved algorithm is proposed, which can improve the composition efficiency. At last, an example is provided to illustrate how this method works, and a simulation is given to compare the efficiency of the base algorithm and the improved algorithm.

TI Making puzzles green and useful for adaptive identity management in
   large-scale distributed systems
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Various online systems offer a lightweight process for creating accounts (e.g., confirming an e-mail address), so that users can easily join them. With minimum effort, however, an attacker can subvert this process, obtain a multitude of fake accounts, and use them for malicious purposes. Puzzle-based solutions have been proposed to limit the spread of fake accounts, by establishing a price (in terms of computing resources) per identity requested. Although effective, they do not distinguish between requests coming from presumably legitimate users and potential attackers, and also lead to a significant waste of energy and computing power. In this paper, we build on adaptive puzzles and complement them with waiting time to introduce a green design for lightweight, long-term identity management; it balances the complexity of assigned puzzles based on the reputation of the origin (source) of identity requests, and reduces energy consumption caused by puzzle solving. We also take advantage of lessons learned from massive distributed computing to come up with a design that makes puzzle-processing useful. Based on a set of experiments, we show that our solution provides significant energy savings and makes puzzle-solving a useful task, while not compromising effectiveness in limiting the spread of fake accounts.

AB We introduce a new class of protocols called Proofs of Work or Knowledge (PoWorKs). In a PoWorK, a prover can convince a verifier that she has either performed work or that she possesses knowledge of a witness to a public statement without the verifier being able to distinguish which of the two has taken place. We formalize PoWorK in terms of three properties, completeness, f-soundness and indistinguishability (where f is a function that determines the tightness of the proof of work aspect) and present a construction that transforms 3-move HVZK protocols into 3-move public-coin PoWorKs. To formalize the work aspect in a PoWorK protocol we define cryptographic puzzles that adhere to certain uniformity conditions, which may also be of independent interest. We instantiate our puzzles in the random oracle (RO) model as well as via constructing "dense" versions of suitably hard one-way functions.
   We then showcase PoWorK protocols by presenting a number of applications. We first show how non-interactive PoWorKs can be used to reduce spam email by forcing users sending an e-mail to either prove to the mail server they are approved contacts of the recipient or to perform computational work. As opposed to previous approaches that applied proofs of work to this problem, our proposal of using PoWorKs is privacy-preserving as it hides the list of the receiver's approved contacts from the mail server. Our second application, shows how PoWorK can be used to compose cryptocurrencies that are based on proofs of work ("Bitcoin-like") with cryptocurrencies that are based on knowledge relations (these include cryptocurrencies that are based on "proof of stake", and others). The resulting PoWorK-based cryptocurrency inherits the robustness properties of the underlying two systems while PoWorK-indistinguishability ensures a uniform population of miners. Finally, we show that PoWorK protocols imply straight-line quasi-polynomial simulatable arguments of knowledge and based on our construction we obtain an efficient straight-line concurrent 3-move statistically quasi-polynomial simulatable argument of knowledge.

Participating in virtual communities, communicating via internet, buying product and services through the web is part of our daily behavior. It is not a surprise the tremendous expansion that virtual currencies are experiencing. Virtual currency exchange platforms (VCEP), specialized in trading virtual currency are becoming increasingly popular. The combination of these two concepts calls for a deeper understanding of their value and models both from an organizational and an information system perspective. We investigate Mt.Gox, one of the most popular VCEP, trading till 70 % of Bitcoin transactions in 2013, and suddenly collapsing as consequence of managerial choices and cyber-attacks. We explore this case study in order to understand the value and the risks associated to the system and the consequences of the breakdown of one of the most important player.

AB Technology innovation and new consumers' habits are fostering two interesting experiences in the payments' landscape: the increasing use of mobile payment instruments and the emergence of alternative payment schemes without fiat or banking money, like Bitcoin. This contribution considers both cases as useful drivers for innovation, but at present their positive outcomes are unclear. A synthetic economic analysis highlights costs and benefits for consumers and third-party operators, arguing that mobile payments could improve competition and force banks to rethink their strategies. More controversial issues concern Bitcoin: on this topic enthusiastic expectations of financial operators are jointly considered with cautious positions expressed by regulatory and monetary authorities. Recent tendencies in Bitcoin's informal infrastructure are confirming that an effective decentralized and peer-to-peer payments system is rather hard to build.

AB Client puzzles have been proposed as a mechanism for proving legitimate intentions by providing "proofs of work", which can be applied to discourage malicious usage of resources. A typical problem of puzzle constructions is the difference in expected solving time on different computing platforms. We call puzzles which can be solved independently of client computing resources fair client puzzles.
   We propose a construction for client puzzles requiring widely distributed computational effort for their solution. These puzzles can be solved using the mining process of Bitcoin, or similar cryptocurrencies. Adapting existing definitions, we show that our puzzle construction satisfies formal requirements of client puzzles under reasonable assumptions. We describe a way of transforming our client puzzles for use in denial of service scenarios and demonstrate a practical construction.

SE New Economic Windows
AB Many information-technology innovations are driven, in their early stages, by an egalitarian ethos that empowers individuals through dis-intermediation. Bitcoin and peer to peer financial systems were inspired by these egalitarian ambitions. However, in bitcoin we have recently witnessed a strong centralization around a few large mining pools, which puts control of most of the system in the hands of a few. In this chapter we investigate the physical limits of distributed consensus mechanisms over networks, and discuss whether there are scalability and efficiency reasons that incentivize centralization. We compute the time to reach majority consensus in a variety of settings, comparing egalitarian networks with centralized networks, and quantifying the effect of network topology on the propagation of information.

TI Twister: the development of a peer-to-peer microblogging platform
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PARALLEL EMERGENT AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB This paper proposes a new microblogging architecture based on peer-to-peer networks overlays. The proposed platform comprises three mostly independent overlay networks. The first provides distributed user registration and authentication and is based on the Bitcoin protocol. The second one is a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) overlay network providing key/value storage for user resources and tracker location for the third network. The last network is a collection of possibly disjoint 'swarms' of followers, based on the BitTorrent protocol, which can be used for efficient near-instant notification delivery to many users. By leveraging existing and proven technologies, twister provides a new microblogging platform offering security, scalability and privacy features. A built-in mechanism provides incentive for entities that contribute processing time to run the user registration network, rewarding such entities with the privilege of sending a single unsolicited ('promoted') message to the entire network. The number of unsolicited messages per day is defined in order to not upset users. Security and scalability assumptions have been confirmed in a real-world deployment.

TI Dried apple peel powder decreases microbial expansion during storage of
   beef, pork and turkey, and protects against carcinogen production during
   heat processing of ground beef
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND FEED SCIENCES
AB Protection of the quality of foods such as ground meat, without increased use of antibiotics, is of growing importance. Environmental microbes such as bacteria and yeast are introduced into meat during butchering and processing. Due to the increased surface area of ground meat, the microbial load is higher than in cuts of meat. The presence of non-pathogenic environmental microbes contributes to meat spoilage, including formation of potentially harmful breakdown products. Addition of antibiotics is undesired in light of the increasing microbial resistance linked to their use, and the associated implications for human and veterinary health, and cost-efficient, natural methods for reducing microbial growth prior to delivery to consumers is needed. This study examined the effects of whole dried apple peel powder (DAPP) on microbial growth during cold storage of ground meat, and tested effects on carcinogen levels after grilling. Microbial growth during cold storage, mimicking shelf-life duration, in three types of ground meat (beef, pork, turkey) was tested by kneading DAPP into the ground meat, allowing 10 days cold storage, followed by testing of aerobic, coliform and yeast colony forming units. The neurotoxin norharman in beef patties after grilling was tested by LC-MS/MS. DAPP mixed into ground meat reduced microbial growth during cold storage. DAPP applied to meat patties in a marinade prior to grilling significantly reduced norharman levels (P < 0.05). The results show promise for DAPP as a natural food additive to increase food quality during storage and cooking.

AB The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) within the packet core of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a key node leveraged for essential operations, such as mutual authentication and access control. This centralized node is essential for the overall network operation as it is the cornerstone of the crypto-graphic functions executed in a mobile network. It stores several parameters for each subscriber, including a copy of the secret key k(i) that is securely stored in the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has sparked the concern in the industry on the potential risk of control plane signaling overloads. Due to the traffic characteristics of IoT devices and the potential risk of malfunctioning or compromised devices, there is a potential risk for floods of signaling traffic overwhelming the mobile core network and, in particular, the HSS. Moreover, recent security research has theorized potential attacks against this central core network node that could be launched from a botnet of compromised smartphones. In this paper we theoretically introduce a novel distributed and secure Peer-to-Peer (P2P) implementation of the HSS. Based on the Bitcoin/Namecoin framework, this new architecture drifts away from the symmetric key model of the standard HSS and proposes a robust public key infrastructure. Moreover, it does not rely in central points of failure, it is resilient to signaling overload threats and allows to re-authenticate and re-generate mobile session keys frequently with zero control plane signaling load at the mobile core.

AB Smart communities of the future have features that make them susceptible to a potential loss of privacy for the citizens they serve. These distributed systems need to be responsive to the individual needs of citizen owners yet still maintain the ability to coordinate actions across a neighborhood. The question we wish to address is how can we provide privacy for such open and decentralized environments?
   We propose the use of Bitcoin blockchain together with cryptographic primitives to guarantee that even in the absence of a trusted centralized control, users can agree on an optimal plan for sharing the community resources while not disclosing any private data. We do a case study on a smart community power sharing protocol. Our approach enables the citizens to coordinate this activity without revealing details of their power consumption. Blockchain provides the means to build and maintain a distributed storage for privacy sensitive energy usage data. Moreover, blockchain provides us with an append-only immutable chain of records which is essential for our system and ensures the users cannot insert fake points to their energy usage history.

AB Hash function has important usage in the cryptography for information security. In this work, we used a chaotic hash function which is based on chaotic tent map with changeable parameter for bitcoin application. The values of the parameters are determined by the position index of message's block character. The chaotic 128-bit hash value was generated by iterating the one dimensional and piecewise tent map followed by applying XOR operation. The final hash value which was translated into hexadecimal format shows that no information of the original message left after processing. This algorithm has large sensitivity to the message itself and the initial value which was determined by the sender of the messages. The algorithm was first implemented in MATLAB and subsequently on STM32F4, an ARM-based Microcontroller board as the embedded platform being used.

AB Context Integrity Measurement Architecture (CIMA) was inspired by risk assessments used by credit card companies. These assessments flag excursions from "normal" or "typical" behavior. If an excursion exceeds some threshold level, the card companies require additional proof of identity before allowing a transaction to proceed. CIMA generalizes this idea to measure excursions from physical and/or logical conditions relevant to mobile security. The CIMA concept encompasses identity management, measurement of context integrity, contextbased encryption, mutual authentication, measurement of contextual proximity, and calculation of security risk scores. CIMA uses context as a shared secret between the mobile device and the enterprise, enabling very efficient setup of one-time session encryption keys and mutual authentication. The architecture can measure the proximity of current context to historical contexts without exposing raw sensor details-a privacy-preserving feature. The architecture obfuscates sensor data by hashing it, and retains only hashes at the enterprise level. CIMA assigns weights-either manually or automatically-to the value of sensor data. The architecture can be implemented with a lightweight engine on the mobile device, and with a searchable and auditable context ledger at the enterprise or cloud level. Peer-to-peer applications may need to sacrifice the auditable context ledger due to processing constraints.

AB Cryptocurrencies have emerged as important financial software systems. They rely on a secure distributed ledger data structure; mining is an integral part of such systems. Mining adds records of past transactions to the distributed ledger known as Blockchain, allowing users to reach secure, robust consensus for each transaction. Mining also introduces wealth in the form of new units of currency. Cryptocurrencies lack a central authority to mediate transactions because they were designed as peerto- peer systems. They rely on miners to validate transactions. Cryptocurrencies require strong, secure mining algorithms.
   In this paper we survey and compare and contrast current mining techniques as used by major Cryptocurrencies. We evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and possible threats to each mining strategy. Overall, a perspective on how Cryptocurrencies mine, where they have comparable performance and assurance, and where they have unique threats and strengths are outlined.

A crypto currency is a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of new units. In this paper, we analyze two of the popular crypto currencies, i.e., Bitcoin and Litecoin. We construct network of transactions from public transaction ledger. We investigate the structure of currency transaction network by measuring the network characteristics.

AB "Virtual currencies" are a monetary phenomenon not easily defined. They set themselves at the crossroads between money, investment instruments, possibly commodities, and notwithstanding the fact that they are relatively widespread in practice (Bitcoin is the most prominent example), they are still lacking specific regulation in almost all legal systems. This poses a series of problems and risks that have caught the attention of regulators and market operators, some of whom have recently released important studies highlighting the need for ad hoc rules. The paper aims at giving a brief overview of the legal nature of these currencies and the possible rules which may be applied to them pending the approval of specific legislation.

AB Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency today. A bedrock of the Bitcoin framework is mining, a computation intensive process that is used to verify Bitcoin transactions for pro fit. We observe that mining is inherently error tolerant due to its embarrassingly parallel and probabilistic nature. We exploit this inherent tolerance to inaccuracy by proposing approximate mining circuits that trade off reliability with area and delay. These circuits can then be operated at Better Than Worst-Case (BTWC) to enable further gains. Our results show that approximation has the potential to increase mining profits by 30%.

It is expected to replace the traditional currencies among online transactions. Building on that, we believe that the security issues during Bitcoin payment must be put in high priority. Therefore, we performed some researches on Double-spending issues. In this paper, the root causes of double spending are discussed, we focus on one possible method of double spending under the circumstance that the network connection status is not stable. We further simulate the attacking in a local area with network impairment. In terms of the reasons and specific conditions of this type of attacking, we propose a new mechanism to help these community merchants to recognize the double spending transactions and defend the related attacking. Finally, an analysis is performed among this defending strategies and it proves that the countermeasures are effective to reduce the double-spending risks.

AB A recent development has provided us with a new computing paradigm: the blockchain. First described by Satoshi in 2008, it is the first example of a computer that has the functionality to remember and enforce past statements by participants, in a non-localized, resilient and auditable manner. Although the Internet has allowed us to create a global infrastructure for cheap and flexible communication, no strong statements can follow from its weak economic signals without resorting to a recognised authority. A global information system that has the properties of the Internet but also the functionality to enforce statements without a trusted intermediary is required: such a system is called trustless. The chapter follows the examples of the usage of blockchain technology as a system that provides guarantees over the rules of its operations in consumer goods, online dating and international trade, with no need of third party intervention for the creation of trust, unleashing new potential business opportunities.

AB An ever increasing number of physical and virtual sensors are digitizing the world around us. Today, most of this data is trapped in application-specific environments, and even if accessible in principle, discovery remains a problem. An open and transparent data market brings incentives for sensor owners to offer measurement data and provides means for discovery. We envision a decentralized data market based on peer-to-peer data exchange and payments. The presented prototype is an iteration of this idea based on the 21 Bitcoin computer, a computer with an embedded Bitcoin mining chip, as well as tools and services to simplify machine-to-machine payments based on Bitcoin.

AB We address the problem of a secure direct communication of two arbitrary peers in a P2P network without knowing each other's IP addresses. An efficient solution to this problem will provide a practically usable way of communication to privacy-sensitive P2P applications. Traditionally, P2P architectures view this problem as a problem of mutual anonymity of a message sender and receiver, but usual solutions suffer from various inefficiencies or complexities. By looking at the problem from a perspective of an ad-hoc network, we are able to apply a familiar approach of multihop communication and ad-hoc routing algorithms to a P2P overlay. Introduced usage of a public key as a node's identifier adds further security features, including data integrity through digital signatures, or end-to-end encryption. Proposed P2P overlay has been successfully used for building a decentralised cryptocurrency exchange Coincer.

TI Want to scale in centralized systems? Think P2P
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS
AB Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have been widely researched over the past decade, leading to highly scalable implementations for a wide range of distributed services and applications. A P2P system assigns symmetric roles to machines, which can act both as client and server. This alleviates the need for any central component to maintain a global knowledge of the system. Instead, each peer takes individual decisions based on a local knowledge of the rest of the system, providing scalability by design. While P2P systems have been successfully applied to a wide range of distributed applications (multicast, routing, storage, pub-sub, video streaming), with some highly visible successes (Skype, Bitcoin), they tend to have fallen out of fashion in favor of a much more cloud-centric vision of the current Internet. We think this is paradoxical, as cloud-based systems are themselves large-scale, highly distributed infrastructures. They reside within massive, densely interconnected datacenters, and must execute efficiently on an increasing number of machines, while dealing with growing volumes of data. Today even more than a decade ago, large-scale systems require scalable designs to deliver efficient services.
   In this paper we argue that the local nature of P2P systems is key for scalability regardless whether a system is eventually deployed on a single multi-core machine, distributed within a data center, or fully decentralized across multiple autonomous hosts. Our claim is backed by the observation that some of the most scalable services in use today have been heavily influenced by abstractions and rationales introduced in the context of P2P systems. Looking to the future, we argue that future large-scale systems could greatly benefit from fully decentralized strategies inspired from P2P systems. We illustrate the P2P legacy through several examples related to Cloud Computing and Big Data, and provide general guidelines to design large-scale systems according to a P2P philosophy.

SO ZBORNIK VELEUCILISTA U RIJECI-JOURNAL OF THE POLYTECHNICS OF RIJEKA
AB The history of bitcoin started in 2008 when the article "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" was published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then the bitcoin has undergone significant changes marked with rapid growth and decline of its value, accompanied by public attention. The bitcoin is a system based on complex cryptographic algorithms without central authority that releases money or monitors transactions. There are discussions over the issue whether bitcoin could possibly become a new global currency that would not be affected by inflation and would not be influenced by central banks. Decentralization and unregulated system were considered as its biggest advantage. However, it proved also to be a major cause of its great volatility since the bitcoin price depends on the relationship between supply and demand. This paper analyzes the role of the bitcoin on the financial market, profitability of bitcoin investments, and the future of this cryptocurrency. Based on the facts of the essence of bitcoin and using technical analysis, it has been found that the value of bitcoin will decrease in future, therefore it does not represent a good investment opportunity. Furthermore, it has neither future as a secure means of preserving the value, nor as a global currency. However, there is a possibility that the bitcoin will impose itself as a reliable and inexpensive way of money transfer.

AB A type of Bitcoin node called "Full Node" has to hold the entire of historical transaction data called "Blockchain" to verify that new transactions are correct or not. To operate nodes as Full Nodes, the required storage size will be too large for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, to mitigate storage size, we propose a storage load balancing scheme by distributed storage based on Distributed Hash Table (DHT). By our scheme, nodes in a DHT cluster can behave like Full Nodes without holding the entire of the blockchain.

AB Bitcoin, a distributed, peer to peer crypto currency, has gained a significant popularity among different users around the world by promising users a fully decentralized network with an inherently independence from governments and without the influence of any central authorities and organizations. Mining is the fundamental concept in Bitcoin which must be done in checking all monetary transactions and verifying them which in return generates Bitcoin as a reward to encourage this work. While the qualitative nature of this unique system is clearly accepted and understood, there are some issues regarding to its decentralized network environment. Based on our analysis due to the high variance of solo mining, the number of users joining top most famous Bitcoin mining pools are increasing due to the fact that users together under a Bitcoin pool will have a higher chance of generating next block in the Bitcoin's blockchain by reducing the variance and earning the mining reward. Furthermore, emerging huge mining farms with strong mining resources and fast processing power is another trend toward centralization. Although some might argue that, the protocol itself is purely decentralized and these are marketbased centralization, this trend clearly illustrates that the pure, decentralized protocol of Bitcoin is going toward centralization in its distributed network, where any kind of centralization should be considered carefully due to the 51% attack. By analysing all the created blocks from 2009 to 2014 we proposed a centralization factor which shows how centralized is the state of Bitcoin's network in different years. Centralization, due its simplicity, is a phenomenon that happens to any disciplined and organized system automatically, which in case of Bitcoin is against the pure initial decentralized nature of it and might arise some concerns and threats to the Bitcoin's unforeseeable future.

AB In this paper we study the question of centralisation in bitcoin digital currency. In theory bitcoin has been designed to be a totally decentralized distributed system. Satoshi Nakamoto has very clearly postulated that each node should be collecting recent transactions and trying to create new blocks (Satoshi08). In bitcoin transactions are aggregated in block in order to authenticate them and form an official ledger and history of bitcoin transactions. In practice as soon as expensive ASIC bitcoin miners have replaced general-purpose hardware, production of bitcoins and the validation of transactions has concentrated in the hands of a smaller group of people. Then at some moment in early 2012 an important decision was taken: the Stratum protocol was designed (Palatinus12) which took a deliberate decision to move the power of selecting which transactions are included in blocks from miners to pool managers. The growing difficulty of mining and large standard deviation in this process (Rosenfeld13; CourtoisBahack14) made that majority of miners naturally shifted to pooled mining. At this moment bitcoin ceased being a decentralized democratic system. In this paper we survey the question of a 51% attacks and show that there is a large variety of plausible attack scenarios. In particular we study one particularly subversive attack scenario which depends on non-trivial internal details of the bitcoin hashing process. How does it compare with the current mining practices? We have study the Stratum protocol in four popular real-life mining configurations. Our analysis shows that pools could very easily cheat the majority of people. However the most subversive versions of the attack are NOT facilitated and could potentially be detected.

AB Increasing the computational complexity of evaluating a hash function, both for the honest users as well as for an adversary, is a useful technique employed for example in password-based cryptographic schemes to impede brute-force attacks, and also in so-called proofs of work (used in protocols like Bitcoin) to show that a certain amount of computation was performed by a legitimate user. A natural approach to adjust the complexity of a hash function is to iterate it c times, for some parameter c, in the hope that any query to the scheme requires c evaluations of the underlying hash function. However, results by Dodis et al. (Crypto 2012) imply that plain iteration falls short of achieving this goal, and designing schemes which provably have such a desirable property remained an open problem.
   This paper formalizes explicitly what it means for a given scheme to amplify the query complexity of a hash function. In the random oracle model, the goal of a secure query-complexity amplifier (QCA) scheme is captured as transforming, in the sense of indifferentiability, a random oracle allowing R queries (for the adversary) into one provably allowing only r < R queries. Turned around, this means that making r queries to the scheme requires at least R queries to the actual random oracle. Second, a new scheme, called collision-free iteration, is proposed and proven to achieve c-fold QCA for both the honest parties and the adversary, for any fixed parameter c.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency whose transactions are stored into a public ledger, called blockchain, that can be viewed as a directed graph with more than 70 million nodes, where each node represents a transaction and each edge represents Bitcoins flowing from one transaction to another one. We describe a system for the visual analysis of how and when a flow of Bitcoins mixes with other flows in the transaction graph. Such a system relies on high- level metaphors for the representation of the graph and the size and characteristics of transactions, allowing for high level analysis of big portions of it.

AB The aim of the study is to define the possible effects of electronic payments, which are distinct from conventional payment systems, on central banks and their policies. Since the existence of civilizations, many different values are used for exchange of commodities, goods and services. By the development of modern economics theory, banknotes which is easier to produce, has been started to use instead of precious metals. The monetary value of the banknotes and mintage responsibility were transferred to the central banks. These central banks are tasked with controlling the monetary policies, generally with the goals of economic growth, price stability and stability of financial systems. Recently, the growing understanding of money has became completely different from traditional money and don't control or produce by central banks. However it serves as money and it carries the same specialties. Users are also able to reach and transfer electronic money without intermediaries and central banks. Electronic money is produced and secured by internet codes. Despite the complicated matrix codes, still there are doubts on its security. Some countries prohibited their usage as a policy decision. The most popular electronic money currencies are Bit coin, E-Cash, Visa, PayPal and Check- Free all over the world. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The emergence of decentralized crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and the success of the anonymizing network TOR lead to an increased interest in peer-to-peer based technologies lately - not only due to the prevalent deployment of mass network surveillance technologies by authorities around the globe. While today's application services typically employ centralized client/server architectures that require the user to trust the service provider, new decentralized platforms that eliminate this need of trust are on their rise. In this paper we critically analyze a fully decentralized alternative to today's digital ecosystem - MaidSafe - that drops most of the commonly applied principles. The MaidSafe network implements a fully decentralized personal data storage platform on which user applications can be built. The network is made up by individual users who contribute storage, computing power and bandwidth. All communication between network nodes is encrypted, yet users only have to remember a username and password. To guarantee these objectives, MaidSafe combines mechanisms such as Self-Authentication, Self-Encryption, and a P2P-based public key infrastructure. This paper provides a condensed description of MaidSafe's key protocol mechanisms, derives the underlying identity and access management architecture, and evaluates it with respect to security and privacy aspects.

AB In this paper, we discuss a framework for bridging the gap between security and medical Large Data Analysis (LDA) with functional-biomarkers. Unsupervised Learning for individual e-IQ & IQ relying on memory eliciting (i.e. scent, grandmother images) and IQ baseline profiles could further enhance the ability to uniquely identify and properly diagnose individuals. Sub-threshold changes in a common/probable biomedical biomarker (disorders) means that an individual remains healthy, while a martingale would require further investigation and more measurements taken to determine credibility. Empirical measurements of human actions can discover anomalies hidden in data, which point to biomarkers revealed through stimulus response. We review the approach for forming a single-user baseline having 1-d devices and a scale-invariant representation for N users each (i) having N*d(i) total devices. Such a fractal representation of human-centric data provides self-similar levels information and relationships which are useful for diagnosis and identification causality anywhere from a mental disorder to a DNA match. Biomarkers from biomedical devices offer a robust way to collect data. Biometrics could be envisioned as enhanced and personalized biomedical devices (e.g. typing fist), but used for security. As long as the devices have a shared context origin, useful information can be found by coupling the sensors. In the case of the electroencephalogram (EEG), known patterns have emerged in low frequency Delta Theta Alpha Beta-Gamma (DTAB-G) waves when an individual views a familiar picture in the visual cortex which is shown on EEGs as a sharp peak. Using brainwaves as a functional biomarker for security can lead the industry to create more secure sessions by allowing not only passwords but also visual stimuli and/or keystrokes coupled with EEG to capture and stay informed about real time user e-IQ/IQ data changes. This holistic Computer Science (CS) Knowledge Discovery in Databases, Data Mining (KDD, DM) approach seeks to merge the fields having a shared data origin biomarkers revealed through stimulus response.

AB Network forensics is a method of obtaining and analyzing digital evidences from network sources. Network forensics includes data acquisition, selection, processing, analysis and presentation to investigators. Due to high volumes of transmitted data the acquired information can be incomplete, corrupted, or disordered which makes further reconstruction difficult. In this paper, we address the issue of advanced parsing and reconstruction of incomplete, corrupted, or disordered data packets. We introduce a technique that recovers TCP or UDP conversations so they could be further analyzed by application parsers. Presented technique is implemented in a new network forensic tool called Netfox Detective. We also discuss current challenges in parsing web mail communication, SSL decryption and Bitcoins detection.

AB Content Delivery Network (CDN) Systems share many similarities with On-line Markets (OM), since they both provide a way to acquire something (be it information or a physical good) whose quality needs to be certified in order to provide consumer protection. In most common implementations the quality is guaranteed by a central node that provides moderation but also constitutes a bottleneck, a single point of failure and requires a significant amount of dedicated resources (both in hardware and in staffing). In this paper, we study the feasibility of a fully distributed, peer-to-peer based CDN system capable at the same time to provide quality guarantees about the content through well-defined, authenticated and enforced roles. We describe how to build such a structure leveraging bitcoin block-chains, cryptographic accumulators and the bittorrent network, we describe a use case of such a structure to prove its usefulness, and finally we provide a proof-of-concept implementation.

AB The Bitcoin global cryptocurrency system has been the subject of several criminal cases. The Bitcoin network is a peer-to-peer system that has participants from all over the Internet. The Bitcoin protocol requires participating nodes to retain and update all transaction records; this ensures that all Bitcoin activities are accessible from a consistent transaction history database. This chapter describes a graph-based method for analyzing the identity clustering and currency flow properties of Bitcoin transactions. The method, which is scalable to large Bitcoin graphs, focuses on transactions relevant to criminal cases such as Mt. Gox. The analysis, which is performed on two years of Bitcoin transaction data, provides insights into the nature of anonymity provided by Bitcoin and how currency flows between selected users and communities of users.

Our proposal utilizes the distributed consensus mechanism of Bitcoin but for transactions replaces Bitcoin's ECDSA signatures with hash-based Guy Fawkes signatures. While this introduces a number of complexities, it demonstrates that a distributed cryptocurrency is in fact possible with only symmetric cryptographic operations with no dramatic loss of efficiency overall and several efficiency gains.

AB Bitcoin is a crypto currency, a distributed peer-to-peer financial system. Well actually it is an electronic system which manages the provisional ownership of a strictly fixed supply of abstract fungible units which really works as a distributed property register or a digital notary service. This is not so different than managing the ownership of shares in traditional financial markets. Modern financial institutions increasingly just do NOT trust each other, they build co-operative robust and decentralized and increasingly transparent, electronic systems which are and able to both serve the diverse objectives of participants (e.g. traders) and uphold certain security policies. Is Bitcoin actually so brilliant to be called the Internet of money as it is sometimes claimed? Not quite. Consider just the question of speed. Super low latency transactions are a norm in the financial industry, and even ordinary people have access to super fast bank transfers and real-time credit card transactions. Bitcoin remains rather the horse carriage of money. In this paper we look at the question of fast transaction acceptance in bitcoin and other crypto currencies. We claim that bitcoin needs to change in order to be able to satisfy the most basic needs of modern users.

Numerous businesses have started accepting this alternative form of currency as payment method and digital currency platforms are emerging to seize the opportunity to explore new markets. The potential of digital currency payment protocols to act as replacements of existing monetary systems is faced with challenges related to financial, regulatory, societal, and technological factors. In this paper, we are addressing the issue of deflation that could occur in cryptocurrency systems supporting a finite cap on the total amount of currency that will ever be in circulation. Our approach leaves intact the core functionality of these systems.

TI HEAVY SUBGRAPH PAIRS FOR TRACEABILITY OF BLOCK-CHAINS
SO DISCUSSIONES MATHEMATICAE GRAPH THEORY
AB A graph is called traceable if it contains a Hamilton path, i.e., a path containing all its vertices. Let G be a graph on n vertices. We say that an induced subgraph of G is o_i-heavy if it contains two nonadjacent vertices which satisfy an Ore-type degree condition for traceability, i.e., with degree sum at least n-1 in G. A block-chain is a graph whose block graph is a path, i.e., it is either a P-1, P-2, or a 2-connected graph, or a graph with at least one cut vertex and exactly two end-blocks. Obviously, every traceable graph is a block-chain, but the reverse does not hold. In this paper we characterize all the pairs of connected o_i-heavy graphs that guarantee traceability of block-chains. Our main result is a common extension of earlier work on degree sum conditions, forbidden subgraph conditions and heavy subgraph conditions for traceability.

AB In this paper we introduce a new decentralized digital currency, called NRGcoin. Prosumers in the smart grid trade locally produced renewable energy using NRGcoins, the value of which is determined on an open currency exchange market. Similar to Bitcoins, this currency offers numerous advantages over fiat currency, but unlike Bitcoins it is generated by injecting energy into the grid, rather than spending energy on computational power. In addition, we propose a novel trading paradigm for buying and selling green energy in the smart grid. Our mechanism achieves demand response by providing incentives to prosumers to balance their production and consumption out of their own self-interest. We study the advantages of our proposed currency over traditional money and environmental instruments, and explore its benefits for all parties in the smart grid.

TI SECURE BUSINESS PROCESS MODELLING OF SOA APPLICATIONS USING
   "UML-SOA-SEC"
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL
AB Nowadays enterprises arc implementing their WIS through SOA using Web services. They are using MDA principles for design and development of WIS and using UML as a modelling language for business process modelling. Along with the increased connectivity in SOA applications, security risks rise exponentially. Security is not defined during the early phases of system development and left onto the developer. Properly configuring security requirements in SOA applications is quite difficult for developers because they are not security experts. Furthermore, SOA security is cross-domain and all required information is not available at downstream phases. Moreover, focus of the currently available security standards and protocols is technology; they do not provide high level of abstraction. Furthermore, a business process expert, who is the actual stakeholder of the business process model is unable to specify security objectives due to lake of security modelling elements in general purpose modelling languages like UML. As a result, he/she either ignores the security intents in his/her model or indicates them in textual way. We are fostering the specification of security intents at high level of abstraction by presenting a security intents DSL containing the essential SOA security objective. It is a UML profile where security intents can be modeled as stereotypes on UML modelling elements during the business process modelling. Aim is to facilitate the business process expert in modelling the security requirements along with the business process modelling. This security annotated business process model will facilitate the security expert in specifying the concrete security implementation. As a proof of work we apply our approach to a typical business process of "on-line flight booking system".

TI Platelet [H-3] paroxetine binding in female patients with borderline
   personality disorder and their sisters
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB Paroxetine binding could be a vulnerability marker for traits associated with borderline personality disorder (BPD). To study this relationship, we examined [H-3] paroxetine binding in female patients with BPD and their sisters. The sample consisted of 54 sibling pairs in which a proband met criteria for BPD. All subjects were given the Diagnostic Interview for Borderlines, revised (DIB-R), the Diagnostic Assessment for Personality Pathology: Brief Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS), the Affective Lability Scale (ALS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Symptom Checklist-90, revised (SCL-90-R). All subjects had platelets assayed for [H-3] paroxetine binding. There were no significant differences between probands and sisters, but both groups scored significantly lower than a previously studied control group on B-max. There were no differences on Kd. Neither B-max nor K-d was related to most trait or symptomatic measures. Paroxetine binding could reflect endophenotypes common to BPD probands and their first-degree relatives.

AB The notion of mu-agents to develop complex software applications has been under active research interest for some time. Through improved organisational modelling mu-agents provide stronger support for decomposition and abstraction in decentralized applications. With the advent of the mobile application platform Android - which exhibits strong analogies to multi-agent system principles - we strongly believe that mu-agent-based modelling has become an increasingly attractive alternative. It can combine decentralized application development with the wide-ranging set of sensors and communication channels to foster both context-sensitivity and flexibility of applications. By integrating Android with the mu-agent concept mobile applications can put stronger emphasis on coordination of task-oriented agent organisations. As an example how this can facilitate the development of distributed applications, we describe an application for the field of "Unconferences" to dynamically schedule informal talks in an ad hoc manner. We model the central aspects of the application and show the advantages of our mu-agent-based approach. Finally, we contrast our approach to existing work in this field and suggest the consideration of mu-agents as an alternative to conventional object-oriented software development.

TI Decoding of High Rate Convolutional Codes Using the Dual Trellis
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY
AB This paper deals with a posteriori probability (APP) decoding of high-rate convolutional codes, using the dual code's trellis. After deriving the dual APP (DAPP) algorithm from the APP relation, its trellis-based implementation is addressed. The challenge involved in practical implementation of a DAPP decoder is then highlighted. Metric representation schemes similar to the log domain used for log-APP decoding are shown to be unattractive for DAPP decoding due to quantization requirements. After explaining the nature of the DAPP metrics, an arc hyperbolic tangent (AHT) scheme is proposed and its equivalent arithmetic operations derived. By using an efficient approximation, an addition is translated to an addition in the AHT domain. Efficient techniques for normalization and extrinsic log-likelihood ratio (LLR) calculation are presented which reduce implementation complexity significantly. Simulation results with different high-rate codes are given to show that the AHT-DAPP decoder performs similarly to a log-APP decoder and at the same time performs better than a decoder for a punctured code. A fully fixed-point model of an AHT-DAPP decoder is shown to perform close to an optimum decoder. The decoding complexity of the log-APP and AHT-DAPP decoders are listed and compared for several rate-k/(k+1) codes. It is shown that an AHT-DAPP decoder starts to be less complex from a code rate of 7/8. When compared against a max-log-APP decoder, the AHT-DAPP decoder is less complex at a code rate of 9/10 and above.

AB This work proposes an effective method of fighting spam by developing Inexpensive Email Addresses (TEA), a stateless system of Disposable Email Addresses (DEAs). TEA can cryptographically generate exclusive email addresses for each sender, with the ability to re-establish a new email address once the old one is compromised. TEA accomplishes proof-of-work by integrating a challenge-response mechanism to be completed before an email is accepted in the recipient's mail system. The system rejects all incoming emails and instead embeds the challenge inside the rejection notice of Standard Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) error messages. The system does not create an out-of-band email for the challenge, thus eliminating email backscatter in comparison to other challenge-response email systems. The system is also effective in identifying spammers by exposing the exact channel, i.e. the unique email address that was compromised, so misuse could be traced back to the compromising party. Usability is of utmost concern in building such a system by making it friendly to the end-user and easy to setup and maintain by the system administrator.

TI Liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk optimization of a multi-asset portfolio

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB This paper develops a novel approach to assess liquidity-adjusted Value-at-Risk (LVaR) optimization of multi-asset portfolios based on vine copulas and LVaR models. This framework is applied to stock markets of the G-7 countries, gold, commodities and Bitcoin. The results show that our approach is superior to the classical mean-variance Markowitz portfolio technique in terms of the optimal portfolio selection under a number of realistic operational and budget constraints. We find that both Bitcoin and gold improves the risk-return performance of the G-7 stock portfolio. However, Bitcoin (gold) performs better under a scenario of only long-positions (when short-selling is allowed). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The hidden predictive power of cryptocurrencies and QE: Evidence from US
   stock market
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Motivated by the increasing evidence of digital assets as hedge against traditional financial assets, this study examines the predictive power of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) on the US stock returns. We also hypothesize that the unconventional monetary policy namely, Quantitative Easing (QE), is an underlying factor that has sustained the evolution of cryptocurrencies. We advance the literature by accounting for the role QE in the Bitcoin predictability of stock returns. Essentially, we extend the bivariate single factor Bitcoin-based predictive model propose by Salisu et al. (2018) to a multifactor cryptocurrency-based predictive model. Our findings are as follow: (i) when QE is measured directly, the single predictive model seems to be the preferred model; (ii) when QE is measured indirectly, via some transmission channels, the multi-factor based predictive model tend to outperform the single-factor model and (iii) relative to the historical average, the multi-factor based predictive model is the more accurate model to forecast stock returns. These results are robust to different methods of forecast performance evaluation measures and different sub-sample periods. These results have important policy implications for the investors and policymakers. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Co-movements between Bitcoin and Gold: A wavelet coherence analysis
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we use dynamic conditional correlations (DCCs) and wavelet coherence to examine the hedging and diversification properties of gold futures vis-a-vis Bitcoin prices. Our research aims to reveal whether the bubble patterns of behavior in gold futures prices can be used to hedge against the bubble behavior in the Bitcoin market in the short-term, and vice versa: as well as whether each can be used to manage and hedge overall market and sector downside risk of the other asset/commodity. We find evidence of volatility persistence, causality, and phase differences between Bitcoin and gold futures prices. Contagion is observed to increase during the European sovereign debt crisis. Wavelet coherence results indicate a relatively high degree of co-movement across the 8-16 weeks frequency band between Bitcoin and gold futures prices for the 2012-2015 time period.

TI Is the Bitcoin price dynamics economically reasonable? Evidence from
   fundamental laws
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Dynamics of the Bitcoin price as the most prominent cryptocurrency is studied in the light of two fundamental economic laws - the Law of One Price and the Equation of Exchange. Utilizing the unprecedented data availability of Bitcoin statistics, we are able to construct a theoretical exchange rate base of the cryptocurrency with respect to the US dollar. Through the concept of statistical equilibrium verified by the cointegration relationship, we show several interesting points. First, the Bitcoin price dynamics is very well captured by the underlying transaction data which leads to a strong fundamental basis of the cryptocurrency. Second, several historical bubbles hit the confidence intervals around the fundamental price but then start their correction back to the equilibrium. Third, the fundamental price implied by the transaction data is not ever-increasing but reflects the ups and downs of Bitcoin utility in transactions. And fourth, our theory-implied fundamental price suggests that the current (December 2018) Bitcoin price is very close to its fundamental price estimated at around $3,500. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Information dominance among hedging assets: Evidence from return and
   volatility directional spillovers in time and frequency domains
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we aim to compare the information/price discovery abilities of four commonly used hedging assets, i.e. Bitcoin, crude oil, gold and USD, by investigating the return and volatility spillover effects in both time and frequency domains. Various static and dynamic connectedness measures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz [28] and Barunik and Krehlik [29] are utilized. Our empirical results show that firstly the return spillovers within the four hedging assets are mainly observed in short-term horizon, however, the volatility spillovers are primarily found in long-term horizon. Secondly, USD acts as the major information transmitter in return spillovers in both time and frequency domains of short to long-term time horizons. Thirdly, crude oil dominates other assets by contributing the largest net positive volatility spillovers, especially in long-term horizon. Finally, the results in dynamic return and volatility spillovers further confirm the robustness of the main findings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Food quality traceability prototype for restaurants using blockchain and

SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB As competition between organizations are evolving into competition between supply chains, to survive and indeed grow, it is necessary to deliver added value to customers. Traceability has emerged as one of the key measures of operational efficiencies within supply chains and ultimately, customer service. Over the years, organizations have deployed number of methods in delivering food traceability. This paper examines major methods of food traceability currently in existence and proposes a restaurant prototype for implementing more reliable food traceability using Blockchain and product identifiers. The prototype captures data from various stakeholders across the food supply chain, segregates it and finally, applies the Food Quality Index (FQI) algorithm to generate an FQI value. The FQI value helps in identifying whether the food is good for consumption on specified parameters. FQI value is generated based on extant standard storage and handling regulations specified by food safety authorities, and checks whether value so derived, is within the permissible range. The prototype helps in grading food quality for human consumption besides strengthening food (product) traceability. This prototype can be customized to address future requirements of traceability triggered through new information emanating from any stakeholder or the node in the supply chain.

TI Effect of blockchain technology adoption on supply chain adaptability,
   agility, alignment and performance
SO MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment and agility which collectively enhance competitive advantage which in turn influences firm performance. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual framework of the present study is developed by conducting an extensive literature review on blockchain technology, supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and competitive advantage. The sample data were collected from 397 supply chain practitioners in India to validate the conceptual model. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to ascertain the validity of the measures used and a structural model was analyzed for testing the proposed conceptual framework. Findings The results of the present study show that blockchain technology can improve supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility which lead to competitive advantage, which leads to better firm performance. Besides, trust generated through blockchain use also increases firm performance. Research limitations/implications - Currently, the respondents do not have practical experience of using blockchain technology. They have responded based on their knowledge about supply chain and blockchain which they acquired from published sources. Different supply chains require different strategic choices and different information needs. But the present study assumes that all supply chain needs are identical. The present study assumes that government regulations regarding blockchain technology are favorable; however, currently, there is no legal framework to address blockchain technology. The findings of the current study indicate that companies not only should create more awareness regarding blockchain but also should actively work with IT companies that are engaged in developing blockchain-based supply chain solution. Managers, as well as IT companies and academicians, should join hands to study and develop a framework for regulating blockchain technology and suggest these to the policy actors. Practical implications The present study shows that supply chain practitioners are confident that blockchain technology will help improve supply chain parameters. These findings can help IT companies and their marketers for developing and promoting blockchain-based IT applications. In addition, the important implication for supply chain practitioners is that blockchain helps in creating a competitive advantage and increases firm performance. Originality/value The effect of IT on important supply chain variables has been studied in the past; however, there is not a single study which sheds light on how disruptive technologies such as blockchain will affect supply chain adaptability, alignment, agility and firm performance.

TI A framework for food supply chain digitalization: lessons from Thailand
SO PRODUCTION PLANNING & CONTROL
AB The promise of digitalization is enormous and nowhere is it more critical than in its potential to transform food supply chain. Consumers have become more educated and are demanding real-time updated information on foods they consumed through digital media. They are also increasingly demanding to know if the foods they consume are environmentally and socially sustainable or not. As a result, food product traceability, safety, and sustainability issues have become crucial concerns to food retailers, distributors, processors, and farmers. Digitalization allows food supply chains to be highly connected, efficient, and responsive to customer needs and regulation requirements. However, digitalizing a traditional food supply chain is challenging and resource demanding. This is more so for developing countries where moving food from farms to consumers can take months as it travels through an array of middlemen. Unfortunately, little is available in the existing literature on food supply chain digitalization. So far, current researchers mainly explore the benefits of digitalization. Using cases in three companies, this paper explores the practices, challenges, and opportunities faced by Thailand food manufacturers in digitalizing their food supply chains. A framework for food supply chain digitalization is proposed and its implications for research and practices are discussed.

TI Blockchain-driven customer order management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of Blockchain on the customer order management process and operations. There is limited understanding of the use and benefits of Blockchain on supply chains, and less so at processes level. To date, there is no research on the effects of Blockchain in the customer order management process. Design/methodology/approach A twofold method is followed. First, a Blockchain is programmed and implemented in a large international firm. Second, a series of simulations are built based on three scenarios: current with no-Blockchain, 1-year and 5-year Blockchain use. Findings Blockchain improves the efficiency of the process: it reduces the number of operations, reduces the average time of orders in the system, reduces workload, shows traceability of orders and improves visibility to various supply chain participants. Research limitations/implications - The research is based on a single in-depth case that has the scope to be tested in other contexts in future. Practical implications - This is the first study that demonstrates with real data from an industrial firm the effects of Blockchain on the efficiency gains, reduction on the number of operations and human-processing savings. A detailed description of the Blockchain implementation is provided. Furthermore, this research shows a list of the resources and capabilities needed for building and maintaining a Blockchain in the context of supply chains. Originality/value This is the first study that demonstrates with real data from an industrial firm the effects of Blockchain on the efficiency gains, the reduction in the number of operations and human-processing savings. A detailed description of the Blockchain implementation is provided. This paper contributes to the resource-based view of the firm, by demonstrating two new competitive valuable capabilities and a new dynamic capability that organisations develop when implementing and using Blockchain in a supply-demand process. It also contributes to the information processing theory by highlighting the analytics capabilities required to sustain Blockchain-related operations.

TI Exploring blockchain implementation in the supply chain: Learning from
   pioneers and RFID research
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose There is great interest in blockchain in the supply chain yet there is little empirical research to support the consideration of the technology. Ferdows (2018) calls for research aimed at learning from pioneers in the field and Gartner points out that the interest in blockchain holds similarities to the interest surrounding RFID 15 years ago. As a result, there may be opportunities to leverage insights from RFID research to inform the consideration of blockchain. The purpose of this paper is to explore how the Reyes et al. (2016) framework for the implementation of RFID may inform the consideration of blockchain in the supply chain.
   Design/methodology/approach A two-stage approach is used to explore RFID implementation considerations from the Reyes et al. (2016) RFID implementation framework, using an initial exploration of managers interested in blockchain using a focus group and a survey and to more in depth explore three case companies pioneering blockchain.
   Findings Several RFID implementation considerations can inform the consideration of blockchain but there are also differences in considering blockchain. A framework is developed that details considerations found to be relevant by implementation stage.
   Originality/value This paper adds to the limited amount of empirical research on blockchain in the supply chain and advances research beyond the consideration of use cases into the exploration of actual implementation of blockchain in the supply chain. The decision framework developed both leverages and nuances findings from RFID research and can inform managerial decision making. It also adds to research a multi-stage approach to implementation and uncovers rich opportunity to further learn from pioneers.

TI BCON: Blockchain based access CONtrol across multiple conflict of
   interest domains
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB In today's on-demand computing and virtual coalition environment, cross-domain services are acquired and provided. These business domains may belong to either the same or different conflict of interest system. Transitive access" can cause leakage of information between competitors through some other conflict of interest system's member. Therefore, a secure access control mechanism is required to detect and deny "transitive access" efficiently with minimal trust in externalist. Existing access control mechanisms focused on either single or multiple conflict of interest domains but with no "transitive access". In addition, these existing mechanisms are centralized with inherited unfair access control and are a single point of failure. Blockchain (BC) is a shared digital ledger encompassing a list of connected blocks stored on a decentralized distributed network that is secured through cryptography. We propose a BC based access control for conflict of interest domains. We have integrated a BC in our architecture to make access control fair, verifiable and decentralized. Users access histories and "transitive accesses" are stored on BC ledger. We propose a novel mechanism called "Transitive Access Checking and Enforcement (TACE)" i.e., "Algorithm.1". It makes an authorization decision based on BC endorsement that "transitive access" will not occur. "Algorithm.2" verifies and updates users access histories stored at BC before each request approval. Similarly, "Algorithm.3" detects possible future "transitive accesses" and updates Transitive Access Set (TAS) stored at BC after each request approval. The Simple Promela Interpreter (SPIN) model checker is used to verify the proposed mechanisms for "transitive access" detection and prevention. We have identified four conflicting sequences of execution that can cause "transitive access". Results show that the proposed mechanism is safe against "transitive access" by checking all the four possible conflicting sequences of execution.

TI A blockchain based Trusted Persistent Identifier system for Big Data in
   Science
SO FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING AND DECISION SCIENCES
AB A stable reference of Internet resources is crucial not only to identify a resource in a trustworthy and certified way but also to guarantee continuous access to it over time. The current practice in scientific publication as the use of a Persistent Identifier (PID) like a DOI or Handle, is becoming attractive also for the datasets. In fact, in the era of Big Data, the aspects of replicability and verification of the scientific result are paramount. In this paper we verify the functional feasibility of permissioned blockchain technology as a tool to implement a Trustworthy Persistent Identifier (T-PID) system for datasets in the scientific domain.

TI The First Original Copy and the Role of Blockchain in the Reproduction
   of Cultural Heritage
SO PRESENCE-TELEOPERATORS AND VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS
AB The First Original Copy refers to any first true 3D facsimile of a digitally reproduced physical object. The notion of a copy being the first and original implies that it is unique and therefore the approach used for managing rights and ownership influences its value. Whilst virtual goods traded within virtual worlds are subject to rules and policies, the production of digital objects in the real world does not have a mechanism from which rarity and uniqueness can be guaranteed. Digital copies are subject to further copying and thus, the value of even an exact copy can never be perceived to be equivalent to its original. Through what means can we imbue 3D reproductions of cultural objects with value that is at least asymptotic to their originals? There may be a candidate solution. Discussed in this article is a possible approach for resolving a long-term issue related to authenticity, ownership, perpetuity, and the quantitative tracking of value associated with 3D copies. Blockchains essentially bring the systemic management of virtual objects within virtual worlds into the real world. This forum article examines the candidate solution by answering the questions above, and discusses the issues associated with the concept of the First Original Copy.

TI LSB: A Lightweight Scalable Blockchain for IoT security and anonymity
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB In recent years, Blockchain has attracted tremendous attention due to its salient features including auditability, immutability, security, and anonymity. Resulting from these salient features, blockchain has been applied in multiple non-monetary applications including the Internet of Things (IoT). However, blockchain is computationally expensive, has limited scalability and incurs significant bandwidth overheads and delays which are not suited for most IoT applications. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Scalable blockchain (LSB) that is optimized for IoT requirements while also providing end-to-end security. Our blockchain instantiation achieves decentralization by forming an overlay network where high resource devices jointly manage the blockchain. The overlay is organized as distinct clusters to reduce overheads and the cluster heads are responsible for managing the public blockchain. We propose a Distributed Time-based Consensus algorithm (DTC) which reduces the mining processing overhead and delay. Distributed trust approach is employed by the cluster heads to progressively reduce the processing overhead for verifying new blocks. LSB incorporates a Distributed Throughput Management (DTM) algorithm which ensures that the blockchain throughput does not significantly deviate from the cumulative transaction load in the network. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative example for broader IoT applications. Qualitative arguments demonstrate that our approach is resilient to several security attacks. Extensive simulations show that packet overhead and delay are decreased and blockchain scalability is increased compared to relevant baselines. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI System architecture for high-performance permissioned blockchains
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Blockchain(BC), as an emerging distributed database technology with advanced security and reliability, has attracted much attention from experts who devoted to e-finance, intellectual property protection, the Internet of Things (IoT) and so forth. However, the inefficient transaction processing speed, which hinders the BC's widespread, has not been well tackled yet. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, called Dual-Channel Parallel Broadcast model (DCPB), which could address such a problem to a greater extent by using three methods which are dual communication channels, parallel pipeline processing and block broadcast strategy. In the dual-channel model, one channel processes transactions, and the other engages in the execution of BFT. The parallel pipeline processing allows the system to operate asynchronously. The block generation strategy improves the efficiency and speed of processing. Extensive experiments have been applied to BeihangChain, a simplified prototype for BC system, illustrates that its transaction processing speed could be improved to 16K transaction per second which could well support many real-world scenarios such as BC-based energy trading system and Micro-film copyright trading system in CCTV.

TI News and subjective beliefs: A Bayesian approach to Bitcoin investments
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB The use of crypto-currencies in financial applications is receiving increasing interest. This paper relies on a Bayesian framework that combines market-neutral information with subjective beliefs to show an application of how Bitcoin can be exploited to build diversified investment strategies. By means of an intuitive procedure based on the Black and Litterman model, I propose to relate portfolio construction with the role of news in generating investors' subjective beliefs, which are computed according to market reactions occurred after similar announcement events in the recent past. To test this approach, the analysis refers to an extremely volatile market phase for Bitcoin such as the interval from mid-2017 to mid-2018. Results indicate that Bitcoin can contribute to improve the risk-adjusted performances of diversified portfolios and that investors' subjective beliefs can help to interpret the fundamental drivers of crypto-currencies' market behaviors. This approach may also stimulate the investigation of more sophisticated strategies built according to the relationships between news and investors' personal views on Bitcoin market dynamics.

This paper presents an evolving granular fuzzy-rule-based model for temporal pattern recognition and time series prediction in online nonstationary context, where values may be missing. The model has a modified rule structure that includes reduced-term consequent polynomials, and is supplied by an incremental learning algorithm that simultaneously impute missing data and update model parameters and structure. The evolving Fuzzy Granular Predictor (eFGP) handles single and multiple Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) values in nonstationary data streams. Experiments on cryptocurrency prediction show the usefulness, accuracy, processing speed, and eFGP robustness to missing values.

TI Are cryptocurrencies contagious to Asian financial markets?
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB Despite numerous studies on financial contagion over the last few decades, the definition of financial contagion is not universally accepted. Furthermore, economic studies on cryptocurrency are limited. This research presents a pioneering study investigating cryptocurrencies contagion in the Asian financial markets. We use three methods of measuring contagions. The first method adjusts the bias in the correlation coefficient. The second method identifies exceedances (extreme return) and performs a multinomial logistic regression to explain the coexceedances. Finally, we also use a vector autoregression (VAR) system. We documented evidence that the (unadjusted) correlation coefficients between five cryptocurrencies and thirteen Asian financial markets tended to be low in both high and low variance periods. After adjusting the bias in the correlation coefficient, we found that there was no longer evidence of a significant change in the magnitude of the propagation mechanism from five cryptocurrencies to Asian foreign exchange and stock markets. Using a multinomial logit analysis, we also acknowledged that cryptocurrencies tended to be statistically insignificant determinants for both positive and negative coexceedances. Our third contagion analysis using a VAR system further revealed that cryptocurrencies tended to be statistically insignificant determinants explaining the current Asian financial market change variables. Our results suggest that cryptocurrencies do not possess a systemic risk to the Asian financial markets.

AB We examine commonality in returns and volume for Bitcoin-fiat currency pairs, each trading in a country with a single time zone. Bitcoin has substantial volume and obeys the theory related to commonality, liquidity, and price discovery. We find evidence that one common factor explains 68% of the variance in hourly volume. Though trading is higher on weekdays, there is substantial weekend trading, reflecting high retail participation. Volume is higher on exchanges during local working hours, as seen in forex markets, supporting the view that trading patterns depend on the location of trade rather than the location of the asset traded.

Herding is significant (irrespective of Bitcoin's presence and trends over time) and strongly asymmetric (appearing stronger during up-markets, low volatility and high volume days), with smaller cryptocurrencies enhancing its magnitude. Our findings suggest that the cryptocurrency market entails strong destabilizing potential, the latter being of particular relevance to the authorities entrusted with its regulatory treatment.

TI Forecasting of BTC volatility: comparative study between parametric and
   nonparametric models
SO PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB Bitcoin has rapidly gained much attention by media, investors and scholars, since it is widely used for investment purposes as an alternative to regular currencies. The price of bitcoin is characterized with high volatility, which makes firms that hold large amounts of it prone to risks. To prevent those risks and to gain insights into its behavior and trading strategies, it is necessary to forecast bitcoin volatility. In that context, this study reviews the impact of different factors on BTC price, returns and volatility. Moreover, it examines the sensitivity of GARCH family models to standardized residuals distributions in forecasting BTC volatility based on the leverage effect. Then, it compares the best GARCH-type model against the best ANN model with respect to short-term and long-term horizons. Results outline that APARCH, TGARCH and EGARCH are very sensitive to standardized residuals distributions, such that TGARCH run with the normal distribution is the best model that captures BTC volatility. Further, MLP outperforms all the parametric and nonparametric models, while its accuracy weakens with the level of forecasting horizons. Consequently, nonparametric models prevail parametric models in BTC volatility forecasting due to their high degree of flexibility and strong generalization abilities, whereas MLP is only effective in short-term forecasting.

TI Bitcoin mining: A global review of energy and power demand
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB After its introduction in 2008, increasing Bitcoin prices and a booming number of other cryptocurrencies lead to a growing discussion of how much energy is consumed during the production of these currencies. Being the most expensive and the most popular cryptocurrency, both the business world and the research community have started to question the energy intensity of Bitcoin mining. This paper only focuses on computational power demand during the proof-of-work process rather than estimating the whole energy intensity of mining. We make use of 160GB of Bitcoin blockchain data to estimate the energy consumption and power demand of Bitcoin mining. We considered the performance of 269 different hardware models (CPU, GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). For estimations, we defined two metrics, namely; minimum consumption and maximum consumption. The targeted time span for the analysis was from 3 January 2009 to 5 June 2018. We show that the historical peak of power consumption of Bitcoin mining took place during the bi-weekly period commencing on 18 December 2017 with a demand of between 1.3 and 14.8 GW. This maximum demand figure was between the installed capacities of Finland (similar to 16 GW) and Denmark (similar to 14 GW). We also show that, during June 2018, energy consumption of Bitcoin mining from difficulty recalculation was between 15.47 and 50.24 TWh per year.

AB The Internet-of-Things (IoT) can facilitate a perception-driven architectural service. A highly personalized adaptive Architecture-as-Service (AaS), meeting individual demands and expectations, is an example of Design-on-Demand-as needed and when it's needed. This goes beyond reactive smart environments in the direction of a dwelling's anticipatory characteristics, i.e., adapting to changing requirements. For such an architecture to be possible, intelligent materials need to be integrated via the IoT in new structures adapted to life and work circumstance of our time. The IoT is the only practical implementation that can handle the large number of processes involved and connect to computational resources on the cloud. The personalized AaS is protected via blockchain technology and made available, on demand or according to what the context suggests. For this purpose, a decentralized autonomous organization is put in place. Distributed across a large array of various devices, the ledger representing the blockchain enables digital ownership and, more important, interactions without a central control. The data informing the project was acquired from experiments in a Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE)-type virtual reality (VR) system. The same VR facility was used as a modeling medium for the future of a new kind of on-demand adaptive architecture.

AB The paper examines market co-movement between pairs of international assets in the time and frequency spectrum. Using the cumulative prospect theory (CPT), twenty-one cryptocurrencies are classified into high and low assets, with three assets from each class making it into the final sample. We included in our analysis four major global equities. The empirical results indicate a highly connected market for the classified cryptocurrency pairs. Moreover, we found evidence of market differences to be much pronounced as global equities weakly co-move with the cryptocurrency markets. For the undiversified portfolio profitability analysis, the equities, particularly S&P500 unanimously outperformed the cryptocurrencies across all trading scales; whereas portfolio returns produced by PIVX emerged winner under the aggregate return series. Furthermore, the inclusion of CPT classified cryptocurrencies to diversified portfolios constituting international equities significantly affected the portfolio risk-return dynamics positively. Our findings provide intuitive and coherent investment strategies aimed at guiding investors with different market aspirations and risk-return appetite.

AB Smart contracts are scripts on the top of the blockchain technology. They represent a form of automation by what the layers of intermediaries can be reduced or even completely replaced. Accordingly, blockchain smart contracting systems decrease transaction and enforcement costs as well as process time.
   Moreover, we argue, blockchain and smart contracts can facilitate cross-organisational collaboration and their underlying business processes. Hence, they are able to support the integration of entrepreneurs and SMEs into trans-national supply chains by reducing high entry barriers and weakening the dominating position of big players.
   This paper discusses the research questions how blockchain smart contracting can facilitate the implementation of collaborative logistics structures and how the integration of SMEs into sustainable maritime supply chains can be safeguarded. The research bases on expert interviews and case studies. The results showcase the potentials of using blockchain smart contracting in the environment of trans-national and multimodal supply chains.

TI Blockchain: The emerging technology of digital trust
SO TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB Trust in individual relationships with blockchain has become an increasingly prominent issue.
   This study introduces a key heuristic used to assess trust in blockchain by analyzing how privacy and security concerns about blockchains have an impact on the user's attitude and behavior. It proposes a blockchain user model by integrating security and privacy as primary influencing factors of trust and behavioral intent. The results from a user experience model of blockchain users confirm that the model explains user experience and predicts behavioral intent of blockchain. The results establish users' cognitive role in embedding privacy and security in blockchain. The research contributes to the ongoing research by clarifying the role and dimension of trust in relation to security and privacy in blockchains and provides heuristic implications for academia and industry.

TI Lead-Lag relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum: Evidence from hourly
   and daily data
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB This paper investigates lead-lag relationship between heavyweight cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum. Traditional studies of information flow between markets preponderate on cash vs. futures, whereby researchers are interested in the stabilizing impact of futures on spot markets. While interest in the same relationship in the nascent cryptocurrency sphere is emerging, little is known regarding price leadership between these assets. In this paper, we employ a battery of statistical tests-VECM, Granger Causality, ARMA, ARDL and Wavelet Coherence-to identify price leadership between the two crypto heavyweights Bitcoin and Ethereum. Based on one year hourly and daily data from August 2017 through to September 2018, our tests yield varied results but largely suggest bi-directional causality between the two assets. Moreover, the results indicate that intraday crypto traders can barely exploit Bitcoin-Ethereum hourly or daily price discovery process to their advantage.

TI Time-varying dynamic conditional correlation between stock and

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB This study examines the time-varying correlations between six cryptocurrency and S&P 500 index markets using a copula-ADCC-EGARCH model. The increasing influence and usage of cryptocurrencies has led the notion in which it is regarded as risky assets. In order to maximize returns on investment, there must be hedging options to protect investors against potential risks. From empirical analysis, we find the overall time-varying correlations are very low, indicating that cryptocurrency serves as a hedge asset against the risk of S&P 500 stock market. We also show that volatilities respond more to negative shock as compared to positive shock in both markets. Furthermore, we identify Litecoin to be the most effective hedge asset against risk of S&P 500 index. Thus, we conclude that the cryptocurrency might be one of important elements in portfolio diversification. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Unveiling the interplay between blockchain and loyalty program
   participation: A qualitative approach based on Bubichain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Keeping motivated customers partaking in point exchange activities is a major challenge in extant loyalty program (LP) studies. In the literature, IT or its applications play a paramount role in enabling firms to offer superior services and consequently deepen the relationships with their customers. Although already applied to augment customer experience and increase participation in practice, how blockchain applications interact with the LP context is still largely unknown in IS research. The objective of this research is to explore how blockchain, as an IT artifact on the rise, influences value creation in a LP context. Drawing on self-determination theory (SDT), this paper considers both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations in a LP context guided by SDT regulation: meeting the needs of Economy, Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness, and explores the effects of blockchain application on customers' motivations, which influence value perception and participative behaviors. By using an exploratory case study of BubiChain in China, we collected data through semi-structured interviews and extracted from the raw data of BubiChain-based loyalty point exchange platform, including real-time, multi-brands, peer-to-peer, and secure, traceable and fraud-proof exchange. We found that these features of blockchain applications not only improve customers' economic perceived value by meeting their extrinsic motivation but also enhance their social interaction and psychological self-fulfillment value perception by satisfying their intrinsic motivations, thus increasing customers' experience and participative behaviors. We also synthesized the results and theorized the findings into 4 formal testable propositions, which would offer testable hypotheses for future empirical studies. This paper reveals an innovative breakthrough on SDT theory and LP research, and is an early attempt to analyze how the blockchain is applied to LPs. We endeavor to establish a theoretical overview of how the key features of blockchain-driven point exchange platform influence customers' motivations, which affect value perception and consequently induce participative behaviors in a loyalty point context.

TI Uncertainty-aware workflow migration among edge nodes based on

SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Workflow is one of the most typical applications in distributed computing, which makes a variety of complex computing work orderly. However, assigning workflow tasks to nodes in the process of multi-node collaboration is still a challenge, because there are some unpredictable emergencies, i.e., uncertainty, in the process of workflow scheduling. The paper proposes a blockchain-powered resource provisioning (BPRP) method to solve the above problems. Technically, we use the directed acyclic graph in the graph theory to represent the workflow task and optimize the workflow scheduling strategy in the presence of uncertainty. The processing time and energy consumption of workflow tasks are also optimized by using non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III). Finally, we carry out experimental simulations to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI Securing instant messaging based on blockchain with machine learning
SO SAFETY SCIENCE
AB Instant Messaging (IM) offers real-time communications between two or more participants on Internet. Nowadays, most Ms take place on mobile applications, such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber and Facebook Messenger, which have more users than social networks, such as Twitter and Facebook. Among the applications of IMs, online shopping has become a part of our everyday life, primarily those who are busiest. However, transaction disputes are often occurred online shopping. Since most IMs are centralized and message history is not stored in the center, the messaging between users and owners of online shops are not reliable and traceable. In China, online shopping sales have soared from practically zero in 2003 to nearly 600 hundred million dollars last year, and now top those in the United States. It is very crucial to secure the instant messaging in online shopping in China. We present techniques to exploit blockchain and machine learning algorithms to secure instant messaging. Since the cryptography of Chinese national standard is encouraged to adopt in security applications of China, we propose a blockchain-based IM scheme with the Chinese cryptographic bases. First, we design a message authentication model based on SM2 to avoid the counterfeit attack and replay attack. Second, we design a cryptographic hash mode based on SM3 to verify the integrity of message. Third, we design a message encryption model based on SM4 to protect the privacy of users. Besides, we propose a method based on machine learning algorithms to monitor the activity on blockchain to detect anomaly. To prove and verify the blockchain-based IM scheme, a blockchain-based IM system has been designed on Linux platforms. The implementation result shows that it is a practical and secure IM system, which can be applied to a variety of instant messaging applications directly.

AB Business processes often involve operational processes, contracts, and regulations. The modeling of such processes must address regulation monitoring and enforcement and maintain a reliable history of data for evidence. This study proposes modeling business processes as chaincode (CC) on permissioned blockchains (BCs). The challenges encountered by the proposed approach are state synchronizations among distributed nodes (called authnodes)and realtime requirements. This study separates CC executions from the state management of multiple BCs and demonstrates the validity of the proposed approach with a payment authorization system at a Chinese bank.

TI New instant confirmation mechanism based on interactive incontestable
   signature in consortium blockchain
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The blockchain is a radical innovation that has a considerable effect on payments, stock exchanges, cybersecurity, and computational law. However, its limitations in terms of the uncertainty involved in transaction confirmation are significant. In this paper, we describe the design of a decentralized voting protocol for the election of a block generator in a consortium blockchain and propose a new system framework that allows fast and exact confirmation of all transactions. In addition, to replace a transaction's owner signature, a new interactive incontestable signature between the dealer and owner is used to confirm a transaction. By means of this signature, the dealer can assure the owner that a transaction will be permanently included in the blockchain in a non-repudiation manner. Moreover, the signatures of all transactions in a block share only one witness that provides membership proof between the block and these transactions. Finally, a security and performance analysis shows that the proposed schemes are provably secure and highly efficient.

It is therefore useful to understand the features of cryptocurrencies and their economic implications. In this research, we use bitcoin, Ether, and XRP, the three cryptocurrencies with the highest market values as of this writing, as well as Libra, which is forthcoming and topical, as examples to analyze their features. Specifically, we argue that these cryptocurrencies are fundamentally different due to differences in the following factors: the identity management of their ledger writers, their consensus algorithms, and their coin supply. We discuss how these factors determine cryptocurrency performance, including security, privacy, and financial influence. We also discuss potential research topics around these cryptocurrencies that are still open.

TI Blockchain security risk assessment and the auditor
SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB A blockchain is an Internet-based peer-to-peer system that forms a network of independent and connected computers that simultaneously record and verify transactions. This peer-to-peer system focuses on who owns the information and how that information is transferred. Blockchains offer significant advantages over traditional databases where users can delete, modify, and change records. The advantages include improved efficiencies, lower costs, enhanced transparency, and an immutable audit history of all transactions. The advantages, however, are not without significant risks. The risks include technological risks, data security risks, interoperability risks, and third-party vendor risks. Because of the inherent advantages in blockchains, auditors are being called upon to provide assurance services to clients who use blockchains and to advise clients on blockchain technology. Therefore, auditors must be equipped with the knowledge and expertise of not only blockchain technology, but also the assessment of risks inherent in blockchain technology.

TI The value of Blockchain technology implementation in international
   trades under demand volatility risk
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB The extant literature has conceptually argued that Blockchain technology can provide both financial and operational benefits to firms in international trades. However, no studies have systematically and analytically investigated the effectiveness of Blockchain. This study introduces analytical models that consider the implementation of Blockchain technology in international trades, to test whether the technology improves an exporting firm's performance under demand volatility risk. The simulation and numerical analysis results show that the reduced lead time and decreased ocean transport cost under Blockchain enable the exporting firm to increase shipment via the ocean, which reduces the quantity shipped via air. In addition, the reduced total unit cost for ocean and air transports leads the firm to effectively reserve spaces for air transport, which implies that Blockchain makes the firm more proactive while preparing a backup plan to more effectively and efficiently react to demand realisation. We conclude that Blockchain can be beneficial for firms facing considerable demand volatility in international trades, and that such effectiveness could be more effective for firms that prioritise minimising lost sales (by efficiently utilising ocean and effectively exploiting air) over minimising excess quantity shipped by ocean.

SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB This study analyses the price movements of a select sample of cryptocurrencies and examines whether they are cointegrated and predictable using machine learning algorithm and Johansen Test. The study used daily historical trading data of 76 cryptocurrencies sourced from different cryptocurrency exchanges. A sub-sample of six cryptocurrencies were chosen for the cointegration and machine learning analysis based on their market share, attractiveness to the investors and availability of data for the full sample period. The data records starting from April 29, 2013 to February 7, 2019 were considered for the study. An error correction model was estimated to investigate both the long-run and short-run dynamics between the cryptocurrency prices. The evidence from the error correction model estimates shows that there is a long-run association between the prices of crypto currencies. The machine learning algorithm involving neural networks (multilayer perception) was used to comprehend the data patterns in the cryptocurrency price series, and the results show that the model fits well in identifying and predicting the data patterns. The study also examines the possible value drivers of cryptocurrencies by estimating a linear regression with a set of covariates, which include the cryptocurrency demand and supply interaction variables and financial variables such as the NZX/S&P 50 index and exchange rates. The linear model estimates confirm that cryptocurrency market fundamentals have an important impact on cryptocurrency prices; however, they do not support the prediction that financial fundamentals are the major value drivers of cryptocurrencies.

AB Risk management is an important and helpful process for investors, hedge funds, traders and market makers. One of its key points is the appropriate estimation of risk measures which can improve the investment decisions and trading strategies. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies turns them a really risky investment and consequently, appropriate risk measures estimation is extremely necessary. In this article, we deal with the estimation of two widely used risk measures such as Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall in a cryptocurrency context. To face the presence of outliers and the correlation between cryptocurrencies, we propose a methodology based on vine copulas and robust volatility models. Our procedure is illustrated in a seven-dimensional equal-weight cryptocurrency portfolio and displays good performance.

AB In recent years the development of cryptocurrencies and wider implementations of blockchain technology have been valourized as digitally decentralized networks that dissipate control evenly among their peers. With Bitcoin, the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, monetary policy is enacted via software built through an open source consensus model. This promotes a techno-decentralist ideology that promises to democratize societies by eradicating centralized points of control in economic systems. Contrastingly, this paper demonstrates how Bitcoin's production process operates through strict authoritative channels. The overall political framework for altering the Bitcoin code is described as senatorial governance: a (de)centralized model of bureaucratic parties who compete to change the monetary policy (codified rules) of the protocol. This model shows how Bitcoin is not an autonomous system but is assembled and maintained via human discretion.

TI The future of raising finance-a new opportunity to commit fraud: a
   review of initial coin offering (ICOs) scams
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Over one billion US dollars were invested in blockchain in 2016. The potential application of blockchain extends far beyond cryptocurrencies. One use of blockchain is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), a digital method of raising finance involving issuance of tokens in exchange for cryptocurrencies or fiat money. It is a cheaper, easier and quicker way to raise funds compared with traditional public offerings. However, it has raised a new opportunity for fraud. An estimated 10% of ICO funds have been lost to fraud. Using case-study analysis, this study determines characteristics of such fraud schemes and the regulatory changes made in response to them. The study reveals key lessons for investors in terms of proactive steps that can be taken to protect themselves from being victims, for issuers to ensure awareness and take steps to secure investors' trust, and for regulators to promote a safe environment. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to document the effect of ICO fraud schemes on the regulatory environment, which is going through a series of amendments to provide protection against such fraudulent schemes. Additionally, it provides direction for future research to further investigate the risks of this new method of raising funds.

TI Emerging blockchain-based applications and techniques
SO SERVICE ORIENTED COMPUTING AND APPLICATIONS
AB The primary mission of the blockchain is to establish a creditworthy ecosystem among independent participants in a non-trustable distributed environment. A blockchain system is secure and autonomous based on its chained blocks, peer-peer nodes, consensus-based ledger mechanism, anonymous accounts, self-regulated data ownership, and programmable smart contracts. There are continuous arguments at which features from Bitcoin are fundamental for blockchains and what are changeable. Furthermore, a devoted credit system is required to make blockchain systems creditworthy although blockchains provide a creditworthy infrastructure for data-level storage and operations. The necessity, feasibility, efficiency, and expected benefits are crucial factors to evaluate a blockchain venture. Several popular and promising blockchain techniques are underdeveloped; among them are those for blockchain creditworthiness, performance, efficiency, security, privacy, supervision, and online-to-offline integration. A new prosperity of the blockchain is on its way since two symbolic projects, the Libra by Facebook and the DCEP by Central Bank of China, were announced.

TI Blockchain archival discourse: Trust and the imaginaries of digital
   preservation
SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB From its origins in virtual financial transactions, emerging initiatives are seeking to acquire a new identity for blockchain as capable of addressing anxieties over the capacity of digital media to permanently and accurately store information. In this article, we explore the ensuing mediation between blockchain enterprises and new professional communities to which they are catering. Drawing on thematic analysis, we analyze how this process is being carried out through the discursive construction of trust, leveraged rhetorically in academic, trade, and news publications to extend an application for financial transactions to cultural institutions. We describe how trust is used not only to mediate the introduction of an application that prioritizes decentralization and cryptography, but is the turf on which traditional institutions are staking a claim as the trustworthy managers of digital records through their use of blockchain. The concept of the archival imaginary-a vision of what archives and blockchain should be and mean that pivots on imagined needs and technological capacities based on the current information ecology, institutional control, and expert systems-offers a way to illuminate this process.

TI Should accountants care about blockchain?
SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB The use of blockchain technology has increased tremendously over the last decade. Blockchain continues to evolve and new features and capabilities are developed continuously. Although the use of the technology started in cryptocurrency (specifically, Bitcoin), it has expanded to other areas that can benefit from a shared, secure, ledger. This article investigates the potential impact of blockchain technology on the accounting profession. This article analyzes data security and privacy considerations, technology, adoption, and implementation considerations, and some considerations that relate specifically to accounting and auditing. We find that the unique needs of an accounting information system may not be a good match for blockchain as it currently exists. While we explain that blockchain may deliver many benefits, particularly in the areas of data reliability and the financial statement audit, we identify several factors, which raise significant questions about whether blockchain will ever be significantly integrated in the accounting function. Chief among those concerns is the scalability of the technology at an acceptable cost. While significant investment has and will be made for further development of blockchain business applications, it is our assessment that proponents of blockchain integration in accounting have not yet made the economic case for it. We also have significant concerns about whether blockchain technology can adequately address risks associated with data security and privacy. Addressing all these issues will be a minimum requirement for gaining widespread acceptance by firms and their accountants.

TI Advanced social media sentiment analysis for short-term cryptocurrency
   price prediction
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB In recent years, the scrutiny of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as legal and regulated components of financial systems has been increasing. Bitcoin is currently one of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capital market share. Therefore, this study proposes that sentiment analysis can be used as a computational tool to predict the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for different time intervals. A key characteristic of the cryptocurrency market is that the fluctuation of currency prices depends on people's perceptions and opinions, not institutional money regulation. Therefore, analysing the relationship between social media and web search is crucial for cryptocurrency price prediction. This study uses Twitter and Google Trends to forecast the short-term prices of the primary cryptocurrencies, as these social media platforms are used to influence purchasing decisions. The study adopts and interpolates a unique multimodel approach to analyse the impact of social media on cryptocurrency prices. Our results prove that people's psychological and behavioural attitudes have a significant impact on the highly speculative cryptocurrency prices.

AB The cloud network has the advantages in efficiently offloading the large-scale Internet traffic, which is considered as a promising architecture to provide the satisfactory multimedia services for mobile users. However, most current studies lack the joint consideration of economic and security of services in hybrid cloud networks. In this paper, a novel multimedia service optimization mechanism is proposed hereby to meet the user's requirements mentioned above while guaranteeing the reliability of service. Firstly, a credible scheme is designed to help the mobile users distinguish the reliable cloud providers. Meanwhile, a blockchain-based content credibility approach is further designed to guarantee the reliability and integrity of video contents. Moreover, a noncooperative Stackelberg game model is presented to maximize the profit of each party. Furthermore, the equilibrium of this game is achieved by the methods of backward induction and gradient descent. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that our solution has efficient performance in terms of secure service ratio, utility, service pricing, etc.

TI The fundamental problem blocking open access and how to overcome it: the
   BitViews project
SO INSIGHTS-THE UKSG JOURNAL
AB In our view the fundamental obstacle to open access (OA) is the lack of any incentive-based mechanism that unbundles authors' accepted manuscripts (AMs) from articles (VoRs). The former can be seen as the public good that ought to be openly accessible, whereas the latter is owned by publishers and rightly paywall-restricted. We propose one such mechanism to overcome this obstacle: BitViews. BitViews is a blockchain-based application that aims to revolutionize the OA publishing ecosystem. Currently, the main academic currency of value is the citation.There have been attempts in the past to create a second currency whose measure is the online usage of research materials (e.g. PIRUS). However, these have failed due to two problems. Firstly, it has been impossible to find a single agency willing to co-ordinate and fund the validation and collation of global online usage data. Secondly, online usage metrics have lacked transparency in how they filter non-human online activity. BitViews is a novel solution which uses blockchain technology to bypass both problems: online AMS usage will be recorded on a public, distributed ledger, obviating the need for a central responsible agency, and the rules governing activity-filtering will be part of the open-source BitViews blockchain application, creating complete transparency. Once online AMS usage has measurable value, researchers will be incentivized to promote and disseminate AMs. This will fundamentally re-orient the academic publishing ecosystem. A key feature of BitViews is that its success (or failure) is wholly and exclusively in the hands of the worldwide community of university and research libraries, as we suggest that it ought to be financed by conditional crowdfunding, whereby the actual financial commitment of each contributing library depends on the total amount raised. If the financing target is not reached, then all contributions are returned in full and if the target is over-fulfilled, then the surplus is returned pro rata.

TI Relationship between price and volume in the Bitcoin market
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose Bitcoin has recently become the focal point of investors as a digital currency and an alternative payment method. Despite Bitcoin being in the spotlight, a gap in the literature on its price-setting behaviors has been observed. This study aims to contribute to the literature by investigating the relationship between Bitcoin price and volume in the period between January 1, 2012 and April 7, 2018 through a symmetric and asymmetric causality test. Design/methodology/approach Daily price and volume data relevant to Bitcoin traded in the Bitstamp market were obtained from . Within the framework of data applicable for analysis, the data set for this study includes a total of 2,286 observations for the period between January 1, 2012 and April 7, 2018. Findings Based on the results of the standard causality test, a causality relationship was determined from price to volume. Based on the results of the asymmetric causality test between positive and negative shocks of variables, a unilateral causality relationship was determined from negative shocks in Bitcoin prices to negative shocks in trading volume as well as from positive shocks in trading volume to positive shocks in prices. Furthermore, it was found that the relationship between Bitcoin price and volume is cointegrated. Practical implications - The empirical results can be used by investors and portfolio managers to make trading decisions. Originality/value The contribution of this paper to the literature is that it is the first study on the symmetric and asymmetric causality relationship between Bitcoin price and volume. Moreover, this paper reveals short- and long-term behaviors of Bitcoin using the cointegration test used for determining the long-term relationship between Bitcoin price and volume.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the day-of-the-week effects of Bitcoin (BTC) markets on the exchange level from January 2014 to September 2018. Design/methodology/approach The in-depth study on the day-of-the-week effects is conducted by using data consisting of Bitcoin prices denominated in 20 fiat currencies from 23 Bitcoin trading exchanges through the method of rolling sample for calendar effect proposed by Zhang et al. (2017). Findings It is shown by the empirical results that different patterns of the day-of-the-week effects are observed on Bitcoin denominated in various fiat currencies by referring to the price data collected from exchanges. Furthermore, the patterns of the day-of-the-week effects are also available after adjusting Bitcoin prices denominated in domestic currencies into USD. Research limitations/implications - Because of the discontinuity of data for some daily return series, estimation with dynamic variance is not applicable. It is assumed that the error item follows normal distribution with constant variance. Originality/value The day-of-the-week effects are wide-spread in Bitcoin markets, and they are not mainly caused by movements of foreign exchange rates. Actually, empirical findings in this study provide evidence for inefficiency of Bitcoin markets.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of this study hopes to encourage further research into the topic of local currencies, as well as specific research into increasing the efficiency of these systems through the use of blockchain technology. There is currently a lack of available research into the topic, which poses barriers for those who wish to study it, so the paper provides a general overview to be used as a starting point for those wishing to broaden their knowledge of local currency systems while also introducing a working implementation of a proof-of-concept for the proposed system. Design/methodology/approach A literature review of available studies on local currencies is conducted to provide an overview of the current systems and their shortcomings. Subsequently, blockchain technology is briefly introduced and an Ethereum-based model is proposed, which helps overcome the problems identified. The section exploring the Ethereum-based model draws code written by the author to simulate the features. Findings The paper concludes that blockchain technology can significantly help improve efficiency, transparency and security of local currency systems, while also helping cut costs associated with the implementation of a complementary monetary system. In the medium-term, local currency systems will most likely use a blockchain protocol as the underlying technology for the network. Originality/value Local currencies are an understudied topic by itself and the intersection between them and blockchain is a nearly non-existent research space. Thus, the paper takes a multidisciplinary approach, aiming to bridge the fields of computer science and economics to provide a foundation for further research.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to address the problem of content immutability and integrity of online scientific periodicals on the sites of small publishers that can be violated not only by the external hack of the publisher's site but also by publisher's and author's misconduct or by submitting different versions of a periodical to different sites. Design/methodology/approach The authors defined a list of requirements that verify online scientific publications immutability and integrity. Then, the authors analyzed existing projects and recently emerged information on security technologies and identified challenges met during the development and testing. The use of the public blockchain network Ethereum as a secure storage location for data was explained. Findings The authors developed the method of checking online scientific periodicals for immutability and presented ecosystem architecture to control immutability and integrity of data. On the example of the online periodical "Istoriya", it was demonstrated how the immutability of online scientific publication has been verified with the use of the public blockchain over a six-month period. First, operating results were evaluated; challenges hampering the implementation of the suggested ecosystem on Ethereum now were identified; and potential advantages of the suggested approach as compared to similar projects were discovered. Research limitations/implications - The considered prototype is not a ready-to-use system, but in future providing higher transparency and the development of general distributed ecosystem small publishers will have new opportunities for development given that the issues of scalability, reliability and operating speed on a public blockchain will be addressed. Introduction of the described ecosystem may even provoke some changes on such conservative market as that of publishing of academic papers. Originality/value This research is one of the first attempts to expand digital object identifier technology with the use of additional verifications based on the data storage and search in the public blockchain. The suggested idea is the example of "blockchainified science" that was brought to implementation in a real online journal. This method has some advantages compared to Crossmark service.

AB The energy sector is undergoing a massive transformation that greatly affects and is being affected by its market mechanisms. This paper presents the design, the prototype implementation and the analysis of a decentralized, real-time, uniform-price double auction energy market. The proposed market is a distributed and decentralized application and its rules may be specified through a smart contract. Market participants interact with the smart contract sending their asks and offers and the distributed application clears the market based on a uniform-price economic dispatch model. We propose and analyze three different implementation approaches on an Ethereum blockchain network. A model representing a physical demonstration project conducted in Seattle, USA, is utilized to simulate the power grid and to provide real-life scenarios for our analysis. We systematically evaluate our three implementation approaches and elucidate several blockchain issues regarding the decentralization of next-generation energy markets. In particular, we identify that certain computation modules may be installed on smart consuming devices in order to increase efficiency, security and decentralization and reduce the overall blockchain overhead cost. Furthermore, we show that in order to fulfill the market's high demand for step timing, we ought to have the block generation time several magnitudes smaller compared to the auction period.

TI A theory of optimum cryptocurrency scope
SO ECONOMICS OF INNOVATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGY
AB Robert Mundell (1961. "A Theory of Optimum Currency Areas." The American Economic Review 51 (4): 657-665) framed the fixed-versus-flexible exchange rate controversy in a novel way when he focused attention on currency areas and the ingredients necessary for a group of nations to form an optimal currency area (OCA). This paper proposes an analogous theory for cryptocurrencies, called optimal currency scope (OCS), and explains the conditions necessary for an OCS to exist. In contrast to an OCA, which is defined by its non-overlapping geographic areas, an OCS is defined by its multiple-overlapping attributes and the needs they solve, which we call scope. Scopes are not geographic and have fuzzy boundaries; so, the possibility of competing currencies in a single scope needs to be considered. The central issues surrounding an OCS are the optimal number and magnitude of currency attributes, rather than whether nations should adopt fixed versus fluctuating exchange rates. Similar to the findings since Mundell first introduced his OCA Theory, we find that the optimum number of cryptocurrency attributes and, therefore, the optimal number of cryptocurrencies must be determined empirically rather than theoretically.

The aim of this paper is to review the current state of consumer privacy research in business to consumer e-commerce and thereby understand what has been studied, what is omitted, and what potential research areas have emerged in the course of transformational technological changes. We conducted a systematic review of behavioral studies published on analyzing privacy concerns at the individual level during the last 20 years. We methodically analyzed the selected literature using the thematic analysis technique. The results revealed eight main themes. We present a taxonomy of consumer privacy concerns and a research agenda that could lead to a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of privacy dynamics in e-commerce.

TI MBS: Multilevel Blockchain System for IoT
SO PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING
AB Despite of their increasing popularity, Internet of Things (IoT) platforms are still suffering from major security problems, particularly during communications between the IoT devices. Indeed, these devices are commonly prone to malicious attacks and require prior mutual authentication to guarantee the confidentiality and security of data being shared as well as a proper network operation. In order to deal with this issue, several researchers have proposed the use of the emergent blockchain paradigm, which has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which information will be shared. As this paradigm is facing scalability and flexibility problems, the use of multi-agents systems has been adopted in recent works. However, current solutions are using agents for the rudimentary role of data collection only. In this paper, we propose to secure the IoT platform with a multilevel blockchain system (MBS) where the speed and flexibility of blockchain transactions are enforced by mobile agents which are migrating throughout the IoT network. The simulations of our solution through the Hyperledger Fabric are showing relevant results in terms of response time and energy consumption.

TI Blockchain and edge computing-based architecture for participatory smart
   city applications
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Smart cities aim to provide smart governance with the emphasis on gaining high transparency and trust in public services and enabling citizen participation in decision making processes. This means on the one hand data generated from urban transactions need to be open and trustworthy. On the other hand, security and privacy of public data needs to be handled at different administrative and geographical levels. In this paper, we investigate the pivotal role of blockchain in providing privacy, self-verification, authentication, and authorization of participatory transactions in open governance. We also investigate up to what extent edge computing can contribute toward management of permissioned sharing at specific administrative levels and enhance privacy and provide an economic approach for resource utilization in a distributed environment. We introduce a novel architecture that is based on distributed hybrid ledger and edge computing model. The architecture provides refined and secure management of data generated and processed in different geographical and administrative units of a city. We implemented a proof of concept of the architecture and applied it on a carefully designed use case, ie, citizen participation in administrative decisions through consensus. This use case highlights the need to keep and process citizen participation data at local level by deploying district chaincodes and only share consensus results through permissioned chaincodes. The results reveal that proposed architecture is scalable and provide secure and privacy protected environment for citizen participatory applications. Our performance test results are promising and show that under control conditions, the average registration time for a citizen transaction is about 42 ms, whilst the validation and result compilation of 100 concurrent citizens' transactions took about 2.4 seconds.

SO LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Through the case analysis of China's digital library, the purpose of this paper is to make readers understand the development status, achievements and problems of China's digital library. At the same time, it also enables readers to understand the common application forms of these modern information technologies in digital libraries, so as to provide a reference basis for the application of new technologies in other countries' digital libraries. Design/methodology/approach On the basis of literature review, the authors have analyzed a conspicuous collection of related papers in order to make a comprehensive summary and elaboration on the present situation of modern information technology application in Chinese digital libraries. Findings This paper defines and analyses the concepts, contents and relationships of the three most important modern Big Data information technologies, and then completes the analysis of the current situation of the application of information technology in Chinese digital libraries. The block chain can achieve more accurate information collection, more secure information storage and more effective information dissemination. Artificial intelligence can improve the existing digital library service level in three aspects: resource construction, information organization and information service. Internet plus will help transform the traditional digital library business mode in order to adapt to the change of user-centered service. Originality/value This is among the first structured attempts of comprehensively and generally summarizing the application of modern information technology in Chinese digital libraries. It also contains an original exploration of the relationship between the main kinds of modern information technology. Based on this, a relatively complete application scenario and possible vision of modern information technology in digital library can be built.

TI Reliable interoperation of demand response entities considering
   reputation based on blockchain
SO IEEJ TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB Demand response (DR) in the smart grid will promote the stable operation of the power system and reduce economic costs effectively. However, uncertainty of users' behavior becomes a barrier of DR, in which the credibility between the DR users and aggregators will have a crucial impact on the DR. Blockchain is a new technology to solve the trust problem without third-party endorsement, which has the advantages of decentralization and irreversibility. Considering the difference of computing capability between users and aggregators, this article proposes a blockchain-based strategy to support the bidirectional selection between DR users and aggregators based on reputation values, which improves the success rate of the DR and mitigates the impact of user behavior on the DR. At the same time, this strategy can also increase the enthusiasm of users with a high reputation value to participate in DR. Using the network topology and DR incentive rules of Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, the rationality of blockchain-based reliable interoperation for DR entities proposed in this paper is verified.

TI Secure hierarchical Bitcoin wallet scheme against privilege escalation
   attacks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
AB As the rising popularity of Bitcoin, people tend to use Bitcoin wallets to manage the keys for spending or receiving funds. Instead of generating randomly pairs of keys, which may need higher space complexity for key management, hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets derive all the keys from a single seed, which is sufficient to recover all the keys, to reduce the complexity of key management. In an HD wallet, it allows users to generate child public keys from the parent public keys without knowing any of the corresponding private keys. This feature allows a permitted auditor to derive all the public keys for auditing. However, this feature makes HD wallets suffered from so-called privilege escalation attacks, where the leakage of any child private key along with its parent public key will expose the other child private keys. To confront with this security flaw, we propose a novel HD wallet scheme that gives out a signature with trapdoor hash functions instead of directly giving private keys for signing. Since it conceals private keys from any child nodes, it can prevent from privilege escalation attacks. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme also provides unlinkability between two public keys to achieve anonymity of user identities and high scalability to the derivations of huge amount of keys. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves user anonymity, public key derivation, and high scalability.

   smart contracts
SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB The rapid evolution of the blockchain and distributed ledger technology and the associated applications will require many changes in the way business is transacted and how transactions are recorded. Significant R&D investments in blockchain environments and the maturation of application uses of "smart contracts" and other types of self-executing tools are establishing frameworks for expanded use, infrastructure growth, and further development. The realization of the impact of these investments is currently changing entire business processes, transforming industries, and impacting governments globally. This global disruptive impact is a major technology evolution and will be transformational to society over the next several decades much as the Internet has been over the last 30 years. As these changes will be especially transformational to fundamental accounting processes, tools, and methodologies of today, accounting and finance professionals would be wise to embrace the technological challenges associated with blockchain technology.

TI Reducing transaction costs of tradable permit schemes using Blockchain
   smart contracts
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE
AB Tradable permit schemes (TPS) are market-based policy instruments, which are claimed to be more statically and dynamically efficient in achieving their policy objectives compared to the traditional regulatory instruments. However, some researchers argue that the high level of transaction costs associated with these policy instruments might undermine their efficiency. This paper addresses this issue through exploring the use of Blockchain technology in order to lower transaction costs that arise from TPS transactions. More specifically, it identifies the benefits of using Blockchain smart contracts in implementing TPS that include: increasing the amount of relevant information available to interested actors thus reducing uncertainties; reducing the amount of irrelevant information available to interested actors thus decreasing complexities; correcting information asymmetries among the actors involved thus limiting opportunistic behaviours; lowering the need for the involvement of intermediaries thus decreasing direct monetary costs; and facilitating the linkage between buyers and sellers thus improving trading quality. These potential benefits can increase the efficiency of TPS by decreasing policy-related transaction costs.

TI Acceptance of Shari?ah-compliant precious metal-backed cryptocurrency as
   an alternative currency: An empirical validation of adoption of
   innovation theory
SO THUNDERBIRD INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS REVIEW
AB In the crypto world, there is a proverbial (and literal) gold rush now occurring. Currently, more than 37 gold-backed cryptocurrency companies have now emerged. Interestingly, some of them also claim to be Shari?ah-compliant. Introducing precious metal-backed cryptocurrencies is perceived to be an innovation among global payment systems, hampered in part by lack of supporting empirical evidence. Therefore, this research investigates potential users' tendency to adopt a Shari?ah-compliant precious metal-backed cryptocurrency. As such, this study adopts an extended adoption model, which consists of eight factors. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was conducted on data elicited from economic active residents in Klang Valley from questionnaires. Overall, it was found six out of the eight constructs specified to influence the adoption of precious metal-backed cryptocurrency were statistically significant where 54.5% of the variation in adoption of PMBC can be explained by the structure model provided by this research. It was also found 63.55% of the respondents are willing to adopt precious metal-backed cryptocurrency in their future transactions.

TI Radical rentierism: gold mining, cryptocurrency and commodity
   collateralization in Venezuela
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB After the oil price collapsed in 2014, debates in oil-producing nations emerged around the importance of doing away with commodity dependence. Modernization plans and developmental projects sprung up among large and small producers alike. Nevertheless, some countries remain dramatically committed to rentier practices, and many in Latin America and Africa have engaged in new forms of resource dependence by expanding their mining frontiers. Further, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, new forms of online payments entered the global political economy and generated discussion among policymakers about the legality and implications of these payment mechanisms. In this article, I explain the linkages of two apparently disconnected forms of mining. Drawing on the case of Venezuela, I argue that the spread of small-scale, irregular and artisanal gold extraction and cryptocurrency mining is the result of the decaying rentier state in crisis. These originally decentralized and irregular activities were later endorsed and transformed by the state with the Orinoco Mining Arc project and the launching of the commodity-backed cryptocurrency, the 'petro'. The state's endorsement of these forms of mining translate into the collateralization of primary commodities and the emergence of new forms of authority in a radicalized form of rentierism connected with global financial circuits.

TI Evolution of Access Network Sharing and Its Role in 5G Networks
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This paper details the evolution of access network sharing models from legacy DSL to the most recent fibre-based technology and the main challenges faced from technical and business perspectives. We first give an overview of existing access sharing models, that span physical local loop unbundling and virtual unbundled local access. We then describe different types of optical access technologies and highlight how they support network sharing. Next, we examine how the concept of SDN and network virtualization has been pivotal in enabling the idea of "true multi-tenancy", through the use of programmability, flexible architecture and resource isolation. We give examples of recent developments of cloud central office and OLT virtualization. Finally, we provide an insight into the role that novel business models, such as blockchain and smart contract technology, could play in 5G networks. We discuss how these might evolve, to provide flexibility and dynamic operations that are needed in the data and control planes.

TI Secure and transparent audit logs with BlockAudit
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB Audit logs serve as a critical component in enterprise business systems and are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks enabling adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs without getting detected. Among them, two well-known attacks are "the physical access attack," which exploits root privileges, and "the remote vulnerability attack," which compromises known vulnerabilities in database systems. In this paper, we present BlockAudit a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchain to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit and outline its functional and operational procedures. We implement our design on a custom-built Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) blockchain system and evaluate the performance in terms of latency, network size, payload size, and transaction rate. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into BlockAudit to achieve higher security and defend against the known attacks on audit logs.

TI Multi-party Contract Signing Protocol Based on Certificateless
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Online contract signing is becoming more and more popular in e-commerce. It is not easy to sign a contract between two parties who do not trust each other. Many of these protocols involve the participation of third parties, but they are not advantageous in efficiency and prone to security problems. Currently, contract signing agreements with third-party participation are replaced by block chain technology, but the public verification of block chain challenges the sensitive information of both the signer and the contract to be signed. And most of the agreements are for the signing of contracts between the two parties. With the increase of the number of signatories, the communication cost and complexity of the agreements increase sharply. Combined with the existing protocols, this paper proposes an efficient multi-party contract signing protocol. In the protocol, an efficient aggregation signature scheme based on no certificate is used to improve the signature verification efficiency of the signer under the block chain, and only the temporary key of the signer is disclosed on the block chain to reduce the system overhead. The protocol satisfies the requirements of correctness, security, fairness, privacy and high efficiency.

We start with the decentralized supply chain and find that poor data quality lowers supply chain profit and social welfare. We consider the implementation of blockchain to help and identify the situation in which blockchain helps enhance social welfare but brings harm to supply chain profitability. We propose a government sponsor scheme as well as an environment taxation waiving scheme to help. We further extend the study to the centralized supply chain setting.

TI The Bitcoin mining breakdown: Is mining still profitable?
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB We provide an updated estimation of the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network, and a calculation of the evolution of the production cost of Bitcoin over time. Using these data, we conclude that since June 2018 Bitcoin mining is no longer profitable for commodity miners without access to electricity prices below 0.14 $/kWh. This phenomenon explains why many Western miners have dropped out of the circuit, further increasing the centralization of mining activity in China. In addition, we estimate that the marginal cost of the production of bitcoin is around 1,952 US dollars. Below this price the cost of mining would not be profitable, even with the most efficient equipment and the lowest possible price for the energy required. This could lead to a massive exit of the biggest mining players, with unpredictable consequences for the future of this cryptocurrency. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Bitcoin is one of the most influential digital cryptocurrencies in the world, of which the security is under serious threat. One of the most serious security problems is facing several attacking strategies on the bitcoin protocol, represented by selfish mining and block withholding attacks. In this paper, we propose SelfHolding as a combined attack model based on the selfish mining and block withholding strategies. We mainly focus on the SelfHolding attacker when (i) attacking one honest mining pool: (ii) attacking two honest mining pools. Based on the proposed model, we compute the expected revenue of the attacker and analyze the factors affecting it. Finally, we compare the revenues of an attacker under some other attacking strategies to those of our proposed strategy. Our experiments show that when the attacker's computing power is relatively small, SelfHolding attack strategy can obtain higher revenues than the classic selfish mining attack.

AB Smart campuses and smart universities make use of IT infrastructure that is similar to the one required by smart cities, which take advantage of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing solutions to monitor and actuate on the multiple systems of a university. As a consequence, smart campuses and universities need to provide connectivity to IoT nodes and gateways, and deploy architectures that allow for offering not only a good communications range through the latest wireless and wired technologies, but also reduced energy consumption to maximize IoT node battery life. In addition, such architectures have to consider the use of technologies like blockchain, which are able to deliver accountability, transparency, cyber-security and redundancy to the processes and data managed by a university. This article reviews the state of the start on the application of the latest key technologies for the development of smart campuses and universities. After defining the essential characteristics of a smart campus/university, the latest communications architectures and technologies are detailed and the most relevant smart campus deployments are analyzed. Moreover, the use of blockchain in higher education applications is studied. Therefore, this article provides useful guidelines to the university planners, IoT vendors and developers that will be responsible for creating the next generation of smart campuses and universities.

Mostowski showed that any finite poset embeds into the generic multiverse while preserving the nonexistence of upper bounds. We obtain several improvements of his result, using what we call the blockchain construction to build generic objects with varying degrees of mutual genericity. The method accommodates certain infinite posets, and we can realize these embeddings via a wide variety of forcing notions, while providing control over lower bounds as well. We also give a generalization to class forcing in the context of second-order set theory, and exhibit some further structure in the generic multiverse, such as the existence of exact pairs.

TI Breaking the binding: Attacks on the Merkle approach to prove
   liabilities and its applications
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Proofs of liabilities are used for applications, function like banks or Bitcoin exchanges, to prove the sums of money in their dataset that they should owe. The Maxwell protocol, a cryptographic proof of liabilities scheme which relies on a data structure well known as the summation Merkle tree, utilizes a Merkle approach to prove liabilities in the decentralized setting, i.e., clients independently verify they are in the dataset without any trusted auditor's involvement. In this paper, we go into the Maxwell protocol and the summation Merkle tree. We formalize the Maxwell protocol and show it is not secure. We present an attack with which the proved liabilities are less than the actual values when adopting the Maxwell protocol. This attack can have significant consequences: A Bitcoin exchange controlling a total of n client accounts can present valid liabilities proofs including only one account balance. We suggest two improvements to deal with this problem, and we present a formal proof for the improvement that is closest in spirit to the Maxwell protocol. Moreover, we show the DAM scheme, a micropayment scheme of Zerocash which adopts the Maxwell protocol as a tool to disincentivize double/multiple spending, is vulnerable to a multi-spending attack. We show the Provisions scheme, which adopts the Maxwell protocol to extend its privacy-preserving proof of liabilities, is also infected by a similar attack. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Investigating the Bitcoin System and Its Properties within the Scope of
   Business Ethics
SO TURKISH JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Digitalization has increased with globalization, the removal of borders between countries, the liberalization of trade, and the rise in Internet and information technologies. In the digital world, many innovations such as working at home without going to work, mobile or internet banking without going to the bank, and shopping for food without going to the market through shopping sites have entered our lives. One of these innovations is the Bitcoin crypto-monetary system, which is a cheap and easy money-transfer and investment instrument and a unit of spending not connected to a central authority. This system has been in our lives since 2008. This study aims to evaluate businesses' and investors' use and retention of Bitcoin as an investment and conversion tool for money transfers and gold/foreign exchange, to evaluate Bitcoin earnings within the scope of mining operations, and then to address these earnings in terms of morality and business ethics. This evaluation explains the use of the Bitcoin system as a means of exchange in the drug market, its current status within the drug market, its use in money-laundering operations, the instant decreases and increases in its value, its use for tax evasion, its high electrical consumption, and its harm to the environment. In addition, the innovation and superiority of block-chain technology has been discussed and an evaluation has been made.

TI Complementary and Synergistic Properties of Blockchain and Artificial
   Intelligence
SO IT PROFESSIONAL
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain are likely to bring powerful economic and social effects. Blockchain's ability to cryptographically validate identities and transactions and create immutable records can enhance trust, transparency, and accountability. Part of the fascinating character of the AI stems from the fact that computers perform better than humans in repetitive tasks. Their judgment and intelligence are not affected by emotions, feelings, and needs. They have better memories and can process large amounts of information.1 AI, thus, enhances efficiency and provides new opportunities for cost savings and revenue generation. What is even more important is that AI and blockchain have strong complementary capabilities that can have dramatic effects on the performance of industries and markets. Each also has a potential to improve the performance and functioning of the other (see Figure 1).

   transaction network
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Research on the Bitcoin transaction network has increased rapidly in recent years, but still, little is known about the network's influence on Bitcoin prices. The goals of this paper are twofold: to determine the predictive power of the transaction network's most frequent edges on the future price of Bitcoin and to provide an efficient technique for applying this untapped dataset in day trading. To accomplish these goals, a complex method consisting of single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) is used. Based on the results, the presented method achieved an accuracy of approximately 60.05% during daily price movement classifications, despite only considering a small subset of edges.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION
AB Fintechs, as providers of digital service innovations and as highly relevant and novel channels through which to deliver entrepreneurial finance based on the creative use of state-of-the-art technology in the financial domain, have thus far mainly been addressed in research by examining the functional aspects of their value propositions (VPs). This article thus sets out to gain insights into the interplay and overall role of societal VPs as potential antecedents and change catalysts in the formation of the often promised disruptive potential of fintechs for the financial sector. In an inductive, theory-building approach, the authors first examine how societal VPs transcend individual functional and emotional ones for entrepreneurs, and conclude with a conceptual model of how the former can build up the disruptive potential of fintechs and deliver apt solutions for entrepreneurs seeking finance.

TI A blockchain-based approach for a multi-echelon sustainable supply chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technology is destined to revolutionise supply chain processes. At the same time, governmental and regulatory policies are forcing firms to adjust their supply chains in response to environmental concerns. The objective of this study is therefore to develop a distributed ledger-based blockchain approach for monitoring supply chain performance and optimising both emission levels and operational costs in a synchronised fashion, producing a better outcome for the supply chain. We propose the blockchain approach for different production allocation problems within a multi-echelon supply chain (MESC) under a carbon taxation policy. As such, we couple recent advances in digitalisation of operations with increasingly stringent regulatory environmental policies. Specifically, with lead time considerations under emission rate constraints (imposed by a carbon taxation policy), we simultaneously consider the production, distribution and inventory control decisions in a production allocation-based MESC problem. The problem is then formulated as a Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model. We show that the distributed ledger-based blockchain approach minimises both total cost and carbon emissions. We then validate the feasibility of the proposed approach by comparing the results with a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The findings provide support for policymakers and supply chain executives alike.

TI Interactive verification of architectural design patterns in FACTum
SO FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING
AB Architectural design patterns (ADPs) are architectural solutions to common architectural design problems. They are an important concept in software architectures used for the design and analysis of architectures. An ADP usually constrains the design of an architecture and, in turn, guarantees some desired properties for architectures implementing it. Sometimes, however, the constraints imposed by an ADP do not lead to the claimed guarantee. Thus, applying such patterns for the design of architectures might result in architectures which do not fulfill their intended requirements. To address this problem, we propose an approach for the verification of ADPs, based on interactive theorem proving. To this end, we introduce a model for dynamic architectures and alanguage for the specification of ADPs over this model. Moreover, we propose a framework for the interactiveverification of such specifications based on Isabelle/HOL. In addition we describe an algorithm to map a specification to a corresponding Isabelle/HOL theory over our framework. To evaluate the approach, we implement it inEclipse/EMF and use it for the verification of four ADPs: variants of the Singleton, the Publisher-Subscriber, theBlackboard pattern, and a pattern for Blockchain architectures. With our approach we complement traditionalapproaches for the verification of architectures, which are usually based on automatic verification techniquessuch as model checking.

TI Introduction to blockchain and cryptocurrencies
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE COMPUTACAO APLICADA
AB The technology used by cryptocurrencies, such as blockchains, made it possible for users to transact with each other without needing a trusted third-party entity (a bank for example). Cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin and Monero) can be defined as trustless decentralized systems which operate without a financial intermediary, making it possible to build decentralized payment systems where users are able to send payments securely without establishing trust. Due to those characteristics, the use of blockchains has spread rapidly among traditional financial systems. Large banks and corporations are investing heavily in the technology, aiming to increase its systems efficiency and reduce the costs of international transactions. Ripple was one of the first cryptocurrencies directed to financial institutions. The application of technologies brought by cryptocurrencies spread quickly to different areas with the intent of solving a myriad of problems. This tutorial presents an introduction to the technologies utilized by cryptocurrencies. The main objective is to share knowledge about the topic and promote the development of research involving those technologies. We discuss the fundamentals of blockchains and the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Monero, with emphasis on data security and privacy.

TI On the use of blockchain-based mechanisms to tackle academic misconduct
SO RESEARCH POLICY
AB Current incentives for publishing in academic journals result in a "winner-take-all" contest-like situation, with significant benefits for publishing research in quality journals. At the same time, empirically, we observe a greater incidence of research misconduct. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the nature and extent of the misconduct problem, to show why it may persist in the absence of conscious remedial action, and to discuss solutions that help lower the likelihood of spurious research escaping undetected. A simple model is constructed to emphasize that there exists the potential for a Prisoners' Dilemma in academia, where scholars engage in misconduct at equilibrium (the Academic Dilemma). The paper then examines why conventional "centralized" regulatory solutions under the current system are not likely to succeed in resolving the problem, analyzes the properties of a decentralized solution utilizing blockchains, and argues that once incentive structures in academia are factored in, a permissioned blockchain may emerge as an effective middle-ground solution for mitigating scientific misconduct. In doing so, the paper highlights the importance of new technologies and recent advancements in Open Science for battling misconduct, and takes stock of the evolving nature of academic publishing.

SO BRITISH ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB This paper reviews the accounting literature that focuses on four Internet-related technologies that have the potential to dramatically change and disrupt the work of accountants and accounting researchers in the near future. These include cloud, big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, access to distributed ledgers (blockchain) and big data supported by cloud-based analytics tools and AI will automate decision making to a large extent. These technologies may significantly improve financial visibility and allow more timely intervention due to the perpetual nature of accounting. However, given the number of tasks technology has relieved of accountants, these technologies may also lead to concerns about the profession's legitimacy. The findings suggest that scholars have not given sufficient attention to these technologies and how these technologies affect the everyday work of accountants. Research is urgently needed to understand the new kinds of accounting required to manage firms in the changing digital economy and to determine the new skills and competencies accountants may need to master to remain relevant and add value.

TI IoT-F2N: An energy-efficient architectural model for IoT using
   Femtolet-based fog network
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Energy- and latency-optimized Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging research domain within fifth-generation (5G) wireless network paradigm. In traditional cloud-centric IoT the sensor data processing and storage occurs inside remote cloud servers, which increase delay and energy consumption. To reduce the delay and energy consumption, an IoT paradigm is proposed using 5G device Femtolet-based fog network. In this architecture, the data obtained from sensors are processed and maintained inside the edge and fog devices. The Femtolet works as an adaptable fog device and it expands and shrinks coverage according to user's presence. A mathematical model is developed for the proposed paradigm. The delay and power consumption in the proposed model are determined. Qualnet 7 is used for simulating the proposed model. The results of simulation illustrate that the proposed architectural model reduces the energy consumption and delay by approximately 25% and 43% respectively than the fog computing-based existing IoT paradigm. The comparative analysis with the existing IoT paradigm shows that IoT using Femtolet-based fog network is a green and efficient approach.

SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Information systems in organizations are regularly subject to cyber attacks targeting confidential data or threatening the availability of the infrastructure. In case of a successful attack it is crucial to maintain integrity of the evidence for later use in court. Existing solutions to preserve integrity of log records remain cost-intensive or hard to implement in practice. In this work we present a new infrastructure for log integrity preservation which does not depend upon trusted third parties or specialized hardware. The system uses a blockchain to store non-repudiable proofs of existence for all generated log records. An open-source prototype of the resulting log auditing service is developed and deployed, followed by a security and performance evaluation. The infrastructure represents a novel software-based solution to the secure logging problem, which unlike existing approaches does not rely on specialized hardware, trusted third parties or modifications to the logging source.

TI Hierarchical Byzantine fault-tolerance protocol for permissioned
   blockchain systems
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Emerging blockchain technology has introduced a new challenge to the distributed system research: Can Byzantine fault-tolerance protocols scale up to, for example, hundreds of nodes? In this work, we introduce HiBFT, a hierarchical Byzantine fault-tolerance protocol to address the problem. The core idea is to divide replicas into groups and exchange consensus messages among groups, thus avoiding the necessity of message broadcasting. The motivation for such approach bases on the hierarchical property of network architecture in permissioned block chains, our target deployments. HiBFT works very much in the same way as the classical Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerance protocol. However, it replaces the concept of physical replica with a logical one that represents a replica group. As such, protocol message complexity can be reduced from O(N-2) to O(s(2)) where N and s are the total number of replicas and the number of groups. Additionally, using threshold signature scheme for representing a logical group results in two important improvements: The cost of signature verification is significantly reduced at each replica; blocks can be secured more effectively in terms of signature size. Our protocol guarantees safety and liveness under partially synchronous assumption with a correctness proof. Our experiment results show that the protocol can scale up to hundred of nodes.

AB Blockchain, a distributed and democratically-sustained public register of the transactions of the digital currency "Bitcoin", proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto a pseudonym of a hided developer in 2009, has been the driver of a huge number of initiatives devoted to develop and implement a peer-to-peer distributed database, and with no central authority created as an open source software. Expansion of Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, has been due to lower transaction costs, high security protocols and lack of inflation with respect to fiat money and no need of a clearing entity or a central bank. Although, environmental issues related to the use of this currency and, in particular, in the energy consumes, have been raised by the scientific community, but no signals of limiting factors have been detected until now. The hidden in the wings blockchain technology has been recognized the driver of innovation in various fields, contributing to create a more sustainable world. The purpose of this paper is to describe both the recent trends in the applications of the blockchain technology in the cryptocurrencies market and the new projects considering the environmental sustainability (energy consumption, materials depletion) and social impacts. The contribute of blockchain in reducing and accelerating bureaucracy and incentivizing environmentally friendly behaviour, has been discussed. Although the environmental issues related to the energy consumed in Bitcoin mining may scare companies in adopting the new technology, there is no evidence of limiting factors or carrying capacity of the entire system. In future the development of a less energy intensive alternative for validating the blocks to stack in the distributed database, would render the blockchain the ideal candidate for the applicability of sustainability paradigms in the economic, environmental and social sectors.

TI Market Drivers and Discovering Technologies in Meat Species
   Identification
SO FOOD ANALYTICAL METHODS
AB Changing demographics and the need to know what we eat has fueled a drastic rise in consumer awareness and hence the demand for certification by government and regulatory bodies. The inceptions of regulations in emerging economies like India and China that have entered the global food trade are expected to increase the demand for testing services. Due to the sheer volume of the global meat market, there has been focus on technologies for meat speciation, like immunoassay-based techniques and electrophoretic techniques. However, by virtue of their intrinsic constraints, these technologies have been superseded by the recent molecular DNA-based methods. DNA-based technologies, mainly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR (RTPCR), are in the spotlight because of their quantitative capabilities, better sensitivity, and rapidity. Next-generation sequencing (NGS), a high-throughput sequencing method, has revolutionized meat speciation studies in terms of speed, read length, and throughput, along with cost-reduction. Variants of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques are an attractive option due to the speed of analysis and minimal sample preparation but they fail to quantify adulteration in cases such as cooked meat, which has more complex chromatographic patterns. Even with the advent of these methods, consumers need to be vigorously assured that players across the supply network are operating in the consumer's interest and not in their own financial gain. Under the Blockchain system of technology, traceability of the end product is feasible at every point of its processing or packaging and all the data can be retrieved in less than 2 min. Considering the intersection of the largest target segment, meat, and the fastest growing technology, PCR-based technology, this review intends to provide an updated overview, of market and research studies for authenticity, and a short summary of traceability systems to enhance trade transparency.

TI A Secure Communicating Things Network Framework for Industrial IoT using
   Blockchain Technology
SO AD HOC NETWORKS
AB Communicating Things Network (CTN) is the latest paradigm in the development of smart technologies. CTN comprises a network of physical devices capable of extracting and sharing digital information. The aim of CTN is to develop smart appliances that boost productivity and provide real-time data rapidly than any structure or a network that is dependent on human interference. Interconnected physical objects in the network communicate with each other and facilitate intelligent decision-making by monitoring and analysing their surroundings. In today's era, CTNs are playing a significant role in daily activities by providing a substantial reduction in costs with increased visibility and efficiency in all aspects of businesses and individuals. In this manuscript, we have considered an important application of CTNs (i.e., IoT) and have proposed a secure Hybrid Industrial IoT framework using the Blockchain technique. We have used a hybrid industrial architecture where different branches of a company are located in more than one country. Although IoT devices are used in many organizations and assist in reducing their production costs along with improving quality, several threats can occur in IoT devices initiated by various intruders. Intruders may compromise IoT devices with the purpose of performing malicious activities. For example, a company's employee may steal some product or may rest during working hours. To prevent these issues, the Blockchain technology is considered as the best technique that provides secrecy and protects the control system in real-time conditions. In this manuscript, we have used a Blockchain mechanism to extract information from IoT devices and store extracted records into Blockchain to maintain transparency among various users located at different places. Furthermore, the experimentation of the proposed framework has been performed against the internal communication of Blockchain where IoT devices are compromised by several intruders. Results have been analysed against the conventional approach and validated with improved simulated results that offer an 89% success rate over user request time, falsification attack, black hole attack, and probabilistic authentication scenarios because of the Blockchain technology.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB Motivation: Clinical genome sequencing laboratories return reports containing clinical testing results, signed by a board-certified clinical geneticist, to the ordering physician. This report is often a PDF, but can also be a paper copy or a structured data file. The reports are frequently modified and reissued due to changes in variant interpretation or clinical attributes.
   Materials and Methods: To precisely track report authenticity, we developed ARBoR (Authenticated Resources in a Hashed Block Registry), an application for tracking the authenticity and lineage of versioned clinical reports even when they are distributed as PDF or paper copies. ARBoR tracks clinical reports as cryptographically signed hash blocks in an electronic ledger file, which is then exactly replicated to many clients.
   Results: ARBoR was implemented for clinical reporting in the Human Genome Sequencing Center Clinical Laboratory, initially as part of the National Institute of Health's Electronic Medical Record and Genomics (eMERGE) project.
   Conclusions: To date, we have issued 15 205 versioned clinical reports tracked by ARBoR. This system has provided us with a simple and tamper-proof mechanism for tracking clinical reports with a complicated update history.

TI An analytic evaluation for the impact of uncle blocks by selfish and
   stubborn mining in an imperfect Ethereum network
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Besides supporting smart contract, another Ethereum distinct feature lies in the improvement of running efficiency achieved by the uncle block mechanism. To mitigate network congestion, an orphan block has a chance to be referenced by a regular block as an uncle block rather than being abandoned directly. In this paper, we use a Markov state machine to model selfish and stubborn mining in an imperfect Ethereum network with natural forks. The security threshold against selfish mining, which indicates how difficult an attacker could gain more than he deserves, decreases to 23.8% in an uncle block rate of 11%. Two advanced selfish mining strategies, trail stubborn mining and equal fork combined with trail stubborn mining, are also analyzed with different uncle block rates in this paper. In different feasible regions, strategies that bring about the optimal reward vary from each other. All evaluations in this paper are carried out in an analytic method, which is more flexible and scalable than a numeric method if it combines multiple attacks or extends to several attackers.

SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
AB Although a number of studies focus on using the blockchain technology (BT) in various application aspects, there is no comprehensive survey on the blockchain applications in maritime shipping supply chain. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive blockchain applications and future improvements survey, and empirically evaluate its effects on intention to use. The results suggested that customs clearance and management, digitalizing and easing paperwork, standardization and platform development dimensions positively affected intention to use. In particular, this paper gives the maritime shipping blockchain-based digitalization also points out the future improvement directions in the blockchain technology.

TI Proof-of-QoS: QoS based blockchain consensus protocol
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB The consensus protocol is the foundation of all blockchain systems. Existing consensus protocols like Proof-of-Work (PoW) consume a vast amount of energy. However, they are severely limited to transaction throughput. Consensus protocols like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) have been proposed to address this challenge. However, these protocols have compromised the fairness by discouraging the "poorer" participants and allowing "richest" stakeholders to have full control over the generation of blocks. Towards meeting these conflicting requirements on throughput and fairness, we propose a blockchain consensus protocol based on the Quality-of-Service (QoS). In our Proof-of-QoS (PoQ) protocol, the entire network is divided into small regions. Each region nominates a node based on its QoS. A deterministic Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus is then run among all nominated nodes. PoQ aims to achieve a very high transaction throughput as a permissionless protocol and provides a fairer environment for participants. Our experimental results show that PoQ can achieve 9.7K transactions per second (TPS) for a network of 12 regions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Research on electronic medical record access control based on blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB For the medical industry, there are problems such as poor sharing of medical data, tampering, and leakage of private data. In view of these problems, a blockchain-based electronic medical record access control research scheme based on the role-based access control model is proposed in this article. First, the appropriate access control strategy is adopted to solve the leakage problem of the user's medical privacy information during the access process. Then, the information entropy technology is used to quantify the medical data, so that the medical data can be effectively and maximally utilized. Using the distributed general ledger characteristics of blockchain and its inherent security attributes, data islands can be eliminated, data sharing among medical systems can be promoted, access records can be prevented from being tampered with, and medical research and precise medical treatment can be better supported. Through this research, not only can user's medical privacy information protection be realized during the service process but also patients can manage their own medical data autonomously, which is beneficial to privacy protection under the medical data sharing.

TI Blockchain-based photo forensics with permissible transformations
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Thanks to the popularity of smartphones with megapixel cameras, people would like to capture and share their daily life by means of photos, which results billions of photos uploaded onto Internet every day. However, photo-faking is an extremely easy task at present, since digital photo editing tools are more and more popular and powerful. Besides, due to the lack of copyright protection mechanisms, photo owners lose control of their photos after uploading the photos to Internet. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based photo forensics scheme in order to uniformly solve photo-faking problems, photo-tracing problems and copyright dispute problems. We combine blockchain technology with image authentication technologies and propose a new mining protocol to stimulate miners to verify photos for users. The scheme allows users to define their own access control rules and provides on-chain photo proofs with which one can verify the copyright of photos and trace the operating histories of them. We implement the system on Ethereum platform and analyze the security of the system. Compared with other schemes, our scheme has the ability of photo forensics with authentication, copyright protection and traceability. In addition, our system allows a variety of permissible transformations without adding additional storage overhead. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Quantum-computing with AI & blockchain: modelling, fault tolerance and
   capacity scheduling
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
AB We model the hardware and software architecture for generalized Internet of Things (IoT) by quantum cloud-computing and blockchain. To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users' selection in a 'win-lose' manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a 'win-win' manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical examples.

TI Secure Electronic Ticketing System based on Consortium Blockchain
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In electronic ticketing system, the malicious behavior of scalpers damages the customer's interest and disturbs the normal order of market. In order to solve the problem of scalpers, we took two steps. Firstly, we established the electronic ticketing system based on the consortium blockchain (CB-ETS). By establishing CB-ETS, we can make the ticketing market develop better in a controlled environment and be managed by the members in the consortium blockchain. Secondly, we put forward a kind of taxation mechanism for suppressing scalpers based on CB-ETS. Together with the regulatory mechanism, our scheme can effectively reduce the scalpers' profits and further inhibit scalpers. Through the above two steps, the scheme can effectively resist the malicious behavior of scalpers. Among them, in the process of transferring tickets, we optimized the transfer mechanism to achieve a win-win situation. Finally, we analyzed the security and efficiency of our scheme. Our scheme realizes the anonymity through the mixed currency protocol based on ring signature and guarantees the unforgeability of tickets by multi-signature in the process of modifying the invalidity of tickets. It also could resist to Dos attacks and Double-Spending attacks. The efficiency analysis shows that our scheme is significantly superior to relevant works.

TI Blockchain in Additive Manufacturing and its Impact on Supply Chains
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS LOGISTICS
AB Additive manufacturing (AM) appears to be a particularly attractive use case for blockchain. This research combines inductive in-depth interviews with the Delphi method to explore what potentials blockchain technology in AM creates, which adoption barriers firms need to overcome, and how supply chains will be affected by the integration of these two potentially disruptive technologies. The results suggest opportunities that are related to intellectual property (IP) rights management, the monitoring of printed parts throughout their lifecycle, process improvements, and data security. The most important barriers for blockchain adoption in AM are an absence of blockchain-skilled specialists on the labor market, missing governance mechanisms, and a lack of firm-internal technical expertise. By addressing important limitations of AM, blockchain is expected to improve the competitiveness of AM in parts' production, catalyzing the trend toward more decentralized manufacturing resulting in more agile, resilient, and flexible supply chains and reduced logistics costs. Beyond that, blockchain-based AM platforms are expected to enhance supply chain visibility, drive supply chain digitalization, support supply chain finance, and contribute to the emergence of shared factory systems.

TI Blockchain-based ubiquitous manufacturing: a secure and reliable
   cyber-physical system
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB With product customisation and emerging business opportunities, small and medium manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) must find ways to collaborate and share competency in a trustable manner to survive a turbulent market. Therefore, service industry turns to the manufacturing industry and SMEs migrate to cloud manufacturing (CM) and ubiquitous manufacturing. However, existing platforms use centralised networking, which suffers from security, scalability and big-data problems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based platform as a trustable network to eradicate third-party problems, which can improve the scalability, security and big-data problems for SMEs. Our proposed platform is developed based on a consortium blockchain which provides a peer-to-peer communication network between the end user and the service provider. We improve existing consensus mechanism and communication protocol based on a cyber-physical system (CPS), via an autonomous agent. Firstly, we provide a review of cloud manufacturing, ubiquitous manufacturing and blockchain-based manufacturing approaches by highlighting the main problems. Then, the proposed platform, blockchain ubiquitous manufacturing (BCUM), is explained, based on its architecture, consensus algorithm and CPS, with the help of autonomous agent communication. The proposed platform has been developed for 3D printing companies which are geographically distributed and tested based on network performance and three practical scenarios.

Governance mechanisms to solve this paradox are embedded into the technical architecture of the platform, addressing the dimensions of access, control, and incentives. Blockchain technology offers unique ways to design novel governance mechanisms through the standardization of interactions. However, the design of such an architecture requires careful consideration of the cost associated with it.

SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Recently, Blockchain technology has been the focus of large research efforts spanning several application domains. Use of Blockchain has been proposed in wireless networks as well. In this paper an overview will be presented of the existing literature about the application of Blockchain in wireless access networks. Then, focus will be put on two distinct uses of Blockchain: i) application of Blockchain for providing anonymous access control to wireless access networks; ii) exploitation of the proof-of-work (a key component of Blockchain) as a mechanism for congestion avoidance replacing exponential backoff when network traffic load is high. Application of Blockchanin mechanisms in the two above cases will be investigated critically. The analysis carried out in the paper shows that, even if there are several technical issues that must be solved yet, the application of Blockchain mechanisms in wireless access networks is very promising.

TI Control of crystal orientation of spatially confined PCL homopolymers by
   cleaving chain-ends of PCL blocks tethered to nanolamella interfaces
SO POLYMER
AB We have examined the crystalline nanomorphology (i.e., crystallinity, melting temperature (reflecting crystal thickness), and crystal orientation) of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) blocks and PCL homopolymers spatially confined in lamellar microdomain structures (nanolamellae) using two polystyrene (PS)-b-PCL diblock copolymers (with either PCL chain-end anchored to nanolamella interfaces) and one PS-b-PCL-b-PS triblock copolymer (with both chain-ends anchored). These copolymers had photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl groups at all the block junctions, so the PCL blocks could be converted into PCL homopolymers by UV irradiation with keeping the nanolamellar geometry. The crystallization of photocleaved PCL homopolymers was achieved by two procedures; (1) the amorphous PCL blocks were first converted into PCL homopolymers and they were crystallized at room temperature (RT) (one-step crystallization) or (2) the PCL blocks were first crystallized at selected temperatures to form some crystalline nanomorphology and then converted into PCL homopolymers to further crystallize and/or anneal at RT (two-step crystallization). The crystallinity and melting temperature of PCL homopolymers were similar for both procedures, suggesting that a certain amount of PCL homopolymers formed lamellar crystals with a comparable thickness. However, the lamellar crystals showed significantly different orientations between two procedures, because some crystal orientation was made by the advance crystallization of PCL blocks and remained unchanged after UV irradiation/subsequent crystallization in two-step crystallization, yielding a substantial difference in the crystal orientation of PCL homopolymers in nanolamellae.

TI Building a Secure Biomedical Data Sharing Decentralized App: Tutorial
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Decentralized apps (DApps) are computer programs that run on a distributed computing system, such as a blockchain network. Unlike the client-server architecture that powers most internet apps, DApps that are integrated with a blockchain network can execute app logic that is guaranteed to be transparent, verifiable, and immutable. This new paradigm has a number of unique properties that are attractive to the biomedical and health care communities. However, instructional resources are scarcely available for biomedical software developers to begin building DApps on a blockchain. Such apps require new ways of thinking about how to build, maintain, and deploy software. This tutorial serves as a complete working prototype of a DApp, motivated by a real use case in biomedical research requiring data privacy. We describe the architecture of a DApp, the implementation details of a smart contract, a sample iPhone operating system (iOS) DApp that interacts with the smart contract, and the development tools and libraries necessary to get started. The code necessary to recreate the app is publicly available.

TI ComChain: A blockchain with Byzantine fault-tolerant reconfiguration
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Selecting which blockchain participants can decide upon a new block is a difficult problem. Consortium blockchains need the participants to be predetermined while public blockchains incentivize all participants to waste their resources to decide every block. In this paper, we introduce the community blockchain that allows potentially all participants to decide upon "some" block while restricting the set of participants deciding upon "one" block. To this end, we propose a blockchain reconfiguration, a Byzantine consensus protocol that allows to dynamically change the set of blockchain participants deciding upon the upcoming blocks. The resulting blockchain, called ComChain, is resilience optimal and transitions through different configurations of participants recorded in dedicated blocks so that each configuration decides upon its subsequent transaction blocks. We evaluate an implementation that adds reconfiguration to the Red Belly Blockchain and demonstrates its practical performance in a distributed system.

TI Connectedness of cryptocurrencies and prevailing uncertainties
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB We investigate dynamic connectedness of cryptocurrencies using Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition into short, medium, and long-term phases. Though all phases resemble similar drifts, the magnitude of short-term connectedness is much higher than medium and long-term. Notably, the U-shaped trajectory explains the increasing connectedness of cryptocurrencies with their heightened popularity in recent times. We further utilize Continuous Wavelet Transform to rationalize such connectedness with common economic and financial market uncertainty. Importantly, we show that as economic uncertainty increases, the connectedness among cryptocurrencies decreases. This highlights the potential for cryptocurrencies to be an alternative instrument for hedging against underlying uncertainty.

TI TraceChain: A blockchain-based scheme to protect data confidentiality
   and traceability
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The risk of sharing data in cloud computing has gathered increasing attention. After the owner of some confidential data outsources the data to cloud storage services and shares it with others, the data owner lost the control to the data to a large extent. To achieve data sharing while keeping data confidentiality, attribute-based encryption (ABE) can be employed by cloud storage services. However, ABE can only guarantee that outsourced data on the cloud is decrypted by attribute-satisfying users but cannot restrict data from being accessed by dishonest users whose attributes also satisfy the access-control policy. It is impossible for the data owner to control the shared data after it has been decrypted by dishonest users, especially when a set of attribute-satisfying dishonest users may collude. To address this concern, we propose a traceable data sharing scheme called TraceChain. In TraceChain, data is encrypted over a new CP-ABE scheme called E-CP-ABE. Furthermore, the system parameters for generating the private key in E-CP-ABE are uploaded to the private blockchain and transactions are performed on the chain. The data owner can obtain the identity of users by monitoring system parameters simultaneously and control data sharing on the blockchain. To prove the security of our scheme, the security analysis is given in this paper. Meanwhile, experimental results also show that our system is viable and efficient.

TI The role of online leadership in open collaborative innovation Evidence
   from blockchain open source projects
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the roles of online leadership in open collaborative innovation success by extending functional leadership theory in the context of open source projects. Design/methodology/approach This study uses negative binomial regression models to empirically test the proposed hypotheses with samples of blockchain open source projects on GitHub. Findings The results indicate that task-oriented leadership behaviors in forms of technical contributions have little influence on open collaborative innovation success; relation-oriented leadership behaviors embedded in internal social capital and external social capital contribute to open collaborative innovation success prominently. Furthermore, the joint effects of technical contributions, internal social capital and community commitment with openness orientation are positively significant on open collaborative innovation success, respectively. Practical implications - For leaders and participants of open collaborative innovation projects, they should attach importance to both leadership behaviors and the joint effects with openness orientation so as to make informed decisions. Originality/value This study offers a new fine-grained framework of open collaborative innovation success by investigating specific dimensions of task-oriented and relation-orientated leadership behaviors, as well as their joint effects with openness orientation.

TI A first look at blockchain-based decentralized applications
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB With the increasing popularity of blockchain technologies in recent years, blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps for short in this paper) have been rapidly developed and widely adopted in many areas, being a hot topic in both academia and industry. Despite of the importance of DApps, we still have quite little understanding of DApps along with its ecosystem. To bridge the knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of blockchain-based DApps to date, based on an extensive dataset of 995 Ethereum DApps and 29,846,075 transaction logs over them. We make a descriptive analysis of the popularity of DApps, summarize the patterns of how DApps use smart contracts to access the underlying blockchain, and explore the worth-addressing issues of deploying and operating DApps. Based on the findings, we propose some implications for DApp users to select proper DApps, for DApp developers to improve the efficiency of DApps, and for blockchain vendors to enhance the support of DApps.

TI Blockchain: Trends and future opportunities
SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Blockchain has been receiving considerable attention from the research community lately. Several research efforts have proposed the use of blockchain in many application domains. Not all of these application areas have received the same level of blockchain attention however and, for some of the applications, blockchain investigation has even stopped. Blockchain has the ability to shape the future, but not in all applications and topics. We explored those application areas that have not received much blockchain attention so that we can focus more on the application domains that have strong potential to reach the customer and have a high impact on the market. Based on our quantitative evaluation of blockchain applications and topics, we recommend those that need further investigation and implementation.

TI BCEdge: Blockchain-based resource management in D2D-assisted mobile edge
   computing
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB In recent decades, newly emerging mobile applications and services are becoming increasingly resource hungry and computation intensive. Portable size mobile devices fall short in providing such services. Cloud computing has been a core computation technology to provide visualized resources in a scalable way for mobile services. However, the unpredictable network transmission latency makes cloud computing not efficient enough for time-sensitive mobile services, which requires major changes in underlying computing platform. Mobile edge computing is widely known as one of the novel technologies has emerged in recent years to address this issue. For being impractical to construct huge edge cloud in network edge, edge clouds can still be overloaded in rush time. Offloading to near-user facilities using device-to-device (D2D) or other technologies becomes an augmentation approach. However, how to manage the facilities/resources effectively become a new issue. In this paper, we proposed a resource management scheme named BCEdge based on blockchain in D2D-assisted mobile edge computing. BCEdge is a reliable scheme that operates in a distributed way to relieve the load of edge clouds. We illustrate the advantages and technical details of BCEdge using flow charts and interaction charts. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of our scheme. Finally, we discuss the possible future extensions.

TI Triple-entry accounting with blockchain: How far have we come?
SO ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB Although double-entry accounting has been used for more than 600 years, today's era of disruptive technological change utilising blockchain and FinTech has led to the emergence of another promising accounting method: triple-entry accounting. This paper explores triple-entry accounting, from its conception to the current state of play, using three case studies. We find that: (i) in a blockchain ecosystem, for some accounts, business entities will only need to perform a single entry internally and the opposite entry will be recorded in a public shared ledger; and (ii) triple-entry accounting is a new and a more efficient way to address fundamental trust and transparency issues that plague current accounting systems. Triple-entry accounting with blockchain, when properly implemented, can fundamentally improve accounting.

TI A Blockchain-Based Platform for Consent Management of Personal Data
   Processing in the IoT Ecosystem
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, the volume of data generated by devices in the user's environment is continually increasing and becoming of particular value. In such an environment the average user is bound to face considerable difficulties in understanding the size and scope of his/her collected data. However, the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) require data subjects to be able to control their personal data, be informed, and consent to its processing in an intelligible manner. This paper proposes ADVOCATE platform, a user-centric solution that allows data subjects to easily manage consents regarding access to their personal data in the IoT ecosystem. The proposed platform also assists data controllers to meet GDPR requirements, such as informing data subjects in a transparent and unambiguous manner about the data they will manage, the processing purposes, and periods. The integrity of personal data processing consents and the immutable versioning control of them are protected by a blockchain infrastructure. Finally, the paper provides a prototype implementation of the proposed platform that supports the main consents management functionality.

SO COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS
AB In this study, the impacts of Bitcoin on Japan, China, Turkey and USA stock indexes were investigated. Nikkei225, SSE380, BIST100 and S&P500 were selected as the stock market indexes. The weekly data including dates between January 03, 2016 and December 16, 2018 were analyzed using EViews program and firstly the time-dependent, non-stationary data set was stabilized. Then, the stabilized data was analyzed with VAR(3) model according to Akaike information criteria. According to the Johansen cointegration test, 2nd model was selected as the most appropriate model for the study. The variables were rearranged with error correction model and then Granger causality analysis was performed. As a result of these analysis, it was determined that Bitcoin only affected BIST100 and that there were two-way causality relation between them. In addition, a one-way causality from Nikkei225 to SSE380, from SSE380 to Bitcoin, from S&P500 to Nikkei225 and from Nikkei225 to Bitcoin were observed.

TI Light Repository Blockchain System with Multisecret Sharing for
   Industrial Big Data
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that promises many exciting applications in various fields, including financial, medical, energy, and logistics management. However, there are still some limitations in the existing blockchain framework that prevents its widespread adoption in the commercial world. One important limitation is the storage requirement, wherein each blockchain node has to store a copy of the distributed ledger. Thus, as the number of transactions increases, this storage requirement grows quadratically, eventually limiting the scalability of a blockchain system. Moreover, the public ledger in a blockchain framework allows anyone in the network to audit the transaction, which may not be favourable in some privacy-sensitive applications. In this paper, a secret-sharing scheme is proposed to reduce the size of the blockchain transactions. Each transaction block is divided into t parts, and the size of each part is 1/t size of transaction block. We use the secret-sharing mechanism to share t parts into n shares. Hence, each node stores not one transaction but one share in the blockchain system. The proposed scheme can eventually reduce the storage cost of a blockchain transaction by 1/t without introducing an additional recovery communication cost; however, robustness is reduced in node failure as a tradeoff. Meanwhile, the proposed scheme was more efficient and secure compared to other state-of-the-art schemes that aim to reduce blockchain storage for industrial big data.

TI On fitting cryptocurrency log-return exchange rates
SO EMPIRICAL ECONOMICS
AB Cryptocurrency has become the leading method for peer-to-peer electronic cash system. It uses cryptography to secure financial transactions. Recently, several researchers have attempted to understand the behaviors of cryptocurrency exchange rates. In this paper, we introduce a new location-scale family of distributions to understand the distributional properties of the log-return exchange rates of cryptocurrencies. We use quantile kurtosis measures to show that the proposed family of distributions provides a desirable level of flexibility in terms of skewness and tail heaviness. Several recent data on US dollar-based cryptocurrency exchange rates have been analyzed, and the results are compared against those of the generalized hypergeometric distribution. It is shown that the proposed family of distributions possesses desired features including model simplicity, shape flexibility and quality of distribution fit.

TI QoS-aware secure transaction framework for internet of things using
   blockchain mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables an enormous network with millions of connected smart things to control almost all aspect of services. In an IoT scenario, self-configured things are dynamically connected in a universal network. The small things are broadly distributed in a real world model with some essential processing capacity and finite storage. Security, privacy and reliability are the most important pillars of the IoT infrastructure. It is challenging to share personal data, highly confidential professional data over a centralized system. The infrastructure itself is capable to provide the guarantee to transmit data safely. However, a special attention for the data along with data consistency is required. Cyber attackers and hackers mostly target the centralized systems. To triumph over these types of situations we propose a security based blockchain service along with some encryption approaches for a secure communication. The encryption and decryption is performed by a hash based secret key. Risk modelling and relative risk reduction also done to prevent attacks under a virtual private network in IoT domain. Before and after attack users also wish to know quality of service (QoS). We have developed a mobile application framework which provides desire output of a user from different aspect of QoS for better understanding. The MQTT broker performs as a negotiator to convey data between cloud consumer and cloud provider. In QoS monitoring section user get chance to reconsider availability, reliability and responsibility like QoS factors while recovering resources and actual resources before attacking system based on CPU utilization, cache status and storage. As per experiment result we able to recover 100% RAM, 97.64% CPU utilization and 78.7% storage using proposed encryption and algorithm on blockchain infrastructure.

TI Big Data and blockchain supported conceptual model for enhanced
   healthcare coverage The Indian context
SO BUSINESS PROCESS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Purpose Significant advances have been made in the field of healthcare service delivery across the world; however, health coverage particular for the poor and disadvantaged still remains a distant dream in developing world. In large developing countries like India, disparities in access to healthcare are pervasive. Despite recent progress in ensuring improved access to health care in past decade or so, disparities across gender, geography and socioeconomic status continue to persist. Fragmented and scattered health records and lack of integration are some of the primary causes leading to uneven healthcare service delivery. The devised framework is intended to address these challenges. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach In view of such challenges, in this research a Big Data and blockchain anchored integrative healthcare framework is proposed focusing upon providing timely and appropriate healthcare services to every citizen of the country. The framework uses unique identification number (UID) system as formalized and implemented by the Government of India for identification of the patients, their specific case histories and so forth. Findings The key characteristic of our proposed framework is that it provides easy access to secure, immutable and comprehensive medical records of patients across all treatment centers within the country. The model also ensures security and privacy of the medical records based upon the incorporation of biometric authentication by the patients for access of their records to healthcare providers. Originality/value A key component of our evolved framework is the Big Data analytics-based framework that seeks to provide structured health data to concerned stakeholders in healthcare services. The model entails all pertinent stakeholders starting from patients to healthcare service providers.

TI BCDN: A proof of concept model for blockchain-aided CDN orchestration
   and routing
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB As the conventional definition, the Content Delivery Networks (CDN) build surrogate servers on top of the Internet architecture to provide contents to the end users as fast as possible. However, the high client requests lead to overloading of the surrogate servers. Despite the routing procedures which try to distribute these high requests among end users, routing these requests to other surrogate servers also emerges as a crucial content provisioning problem. This leads another challenge, which is the high latency that is an inevitable consequence of the conventional CDN architecture. To this end, it is necessary to design a CDN architecture which provides orchestration framework for virtual instances and routing procedure among surrogate servers, by considering the client trends. Moreover, during the routing procedure, the content provisioning should also be taken into account to prevent latency arisen from caching problems. For this purpose, we propose a proof of concept CDN model which combine a novel orchestration framework and blockchain architecture, Blockchain-Aided CDN, namely BCDN. Here the main reason to use Blockchain methodology is its specific features of distributed contracts and fully automated reliable flow generation. With this proposed orchestration framework, we provide dynamically changing virtual instances of the surrogate servers according to client requests and resource capacity. Moreover, by using blockchain network, we ensure that the our proposed CDN model can handle with evenly distributed high bandwidth requests by considering status of other Points of Present (PoPs). Also, deducing from the blockchain data enable surrogate servers to make content provisioning. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Towards a Stakeholder-Oriented Blockchain-Based Architecture for
   Electronic Health Records: Design Science Research Study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Data security issues still constitute the main reason for the sluggish dissemination of electronic health records (EHRs). Given that blockchain technology offers the possibility to verify transactions through a decentralized network, it may serve as a solution to secure health-related data. Therefore, we have identified stakeholder-specific requirements and propose a blockchain-based architecture for EHRs, while referring to the already existing scientific discussions on the potential of blockchain for use in EHRs.
   Objective: This study aimed to introduce blockchain technology for EHRs, based on identifying stakeholders and systematically eliciting their requirements, and to discuss the key benefits (KBs) and key challenges (KCs) of blockchain technology in the context of EHRs.
   Methods: The blockchain-based architecture was developed in the framework of the design science research paradigm. The requirements were identified using a structured literature review and interviews with nine health care experts. Subsequently, the proposed architecture was evaluated using 4 workshops with 15 participants.
   Results: We identified three major EHR stakeholder groups and 34 respective requirements. On this basis, we developed a five-layer architecture. The subsequent evaluation of the artifact was followed by the discussion of 12 KBs and 12 KCs of a blockchain-based architecture for EHRs. To address the KCs, we derived five recommendations for action for science and practice.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that blockchain technology offers considerable potential to advance EHRs. Improvements to currently available EHR solutions are expected, for instance, in the areas of data security, traceability, and automation by smart contracts. Future research could examine the patient's acceptance of blockchain-based EHRs and cost-benefit analyses.

TI Can energy commodities affect energy blockchain-based cryptos?
SO STUDIES IN ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed fresh light into whether an energy commodity price index (ENFX) and energy blockchain-based crypto price index (ENCX) can be used to predict movements in the energy commodity and energy crypto market. Design/methodology/approach Using principal component analysis over daily data of crude oil, heating oil, natural gas and energy based cryptos, the ENFX and ENCX indices are constructed, where ENFX (ENCX) represents 94% (88%) of variability in energy commodity (energy crypto) prices. Findings Natural gas price movements were better explained by ENCX, and shared positive (negative) correlations with cryptos (crude oil and heating oil). Using a vector autoregressive model (VAR), while the 1-day lagged ENCX (ENFX) was significant in estimating current ENCX (ENFX) values, only lagged ENCX was significant in estimating current ENFX. Granger causality tests confirmed the two markets do not granger cause each other. One standard deviation shock in ENFX had a negative effect on ENCX. Weak forecasting results of the VAR model, support the two markets are not robust forecasters of each other. Robustness wise, the VAR model ranked lower than an autoregressive model, but higher than a random walk model. Research limitations/implications - Significant structural breaks at distinct dates in the two markets reinforce that the two markets do not help to predict each other. The findings are limited by the existence of bubbles (December 2017-January 2018) which were witnessed in energy blockchain-based crypto markets and natural gas, but not in crude oil and heating oil. Originality/value As per the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze the relationship between leading energy commodities and energy blockchain-based crypto markets.

Design/methodology/approach To explore previous works on the disruptive potential of technology in accounting, the study compares topics in accounting research articles that contain variations of the term "disrupt" with those articles containing variations of the term "technology". Based on the method first proposed in Marrone and Hammerle (2016), an entity linker application was used to extract key topics from the top 50 accounting journals, and these topics were then compared to determine the extent of thematic intersection. Findings A key finding is that accounting academic articles featuring "disruption" are rarely linked with "technology". The concept of "disruption" has been largely synonymous with crisis, and the crises endured to date have had predominantly social or environmental causes (e.g. the GFC and natural disasters). The literature on technology has coalesced around three broad themes - creation, deployment and protection - which have not been identified as crises triggers so far. This finding underscores the importance of the papers comprising this special issue, which explore enhanced data visualisation, blockchain and social media, as well as considering how such technologies might be managed and their potential for either emancipation or enslavement. Originality/value In relation to the review of prior literature, no previous studies have undertaken a quantitative analysis of the intersection of technology disruption in accounting research. In relation to this special issue, these papers collectively provide a multi-faceted view of how technology can and will transform the practice and potential of accounting in the years ahead. Finally, the provision of a thematic framework and research agenda will assist future researchers in exploring this dynamic and important field.

TI A target-centric intelligence approach to WannaCry 2.0
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate the utility of a target-centric approach to intelligence collection and analysis in the prevention and investigation of ransomware attacks that involve cryptocurrencies. The paper uses the May 2017 WannaCry ransomware usage of the Bitcoin ecosystem as a case study. The approach proves particularly beneficial in facilitating information sharing and an integrated analysis across intelligence domains. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted data collection and analysis of the component Bitcoin elements of the WannaCry ransomware attack. A note of both technicalities of Bitcoin operations and current models for sharing cyber intelligence was made. Our analysis builds on and further develops current definitions and strategies for sharing cyber threat intelligence. It uses the problem definition model (PDM) and generic target network model (TNM) to create an analytic framework for the WannaCry ransomware attack scenario, allowing analysts the ability to test their hypotheses and integrate and share data for collaborative investigation. Findings Using a target-centric intelligence approach to WannaCry 2.0 shows that it is possible to model the intelligence problem of collecting and analysing data related to inflows and outflows of Bitcoin-related ransomware transactions. Bitcoin transactions form graph networks and allow to build a target network model for collecting, analysing and sharing intelligence with multiple stakeholders. Although attribution and anonymity prevail under cryptocurrency usage, there is a means for developing transaction walks using this method to target nefarious cryptocurrency exchanges where criminals are inclined to cash out their proceeds of crime. Originality/value The application of a target-centric intelligence approach to the cryptocurrency components of a ransomware attack provides a framework for intelligence units to break down the problem in the financial domain and model the network behaviour of illicit Bitcoin transactions relating to ransomware.

TI Return and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and other asset classes
   in Turkey Evidence from VAR-BEKK-GARCH approach
SO EUROMED JOURNAL OF BUSINESS
AB Purpose With a substantial return and volatility characteristic of Bitcoin, which may be seen as a new category of investment assets, better understanding of the nature of return and volatility spillover can help investors and regulators in achieving the potential goal from portfolio diversification. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper explores the return and volatility transmission between the Bitcoin, as the largest cryptocurrency, and other traditional asset classes, namely stock, bond and currencies from the standpoint of Turkey over the period July, 2010-June, 2018 using the newly developed multivariate econometric technique, VAR-GARCH, in mean framework with the BEKK representation. Findings The empirical results reveal the existence of the positive unilateral return spillovers from the bond market to Bitcoin market. Regarding the results of shock and volatility spillovers, there exists strong evidence of bidirectional cross-market shock and volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and all other financial asset classes, except US Dollar exchange rate. Originality/value The important extention is the adoption of a newly developed multivariate econometric technique, VAR-GARCH, in mean framework with the BEKK representation, proposed by Engle and Kroner (1995), which is employed for the first time specifically to examine the extent of integration in terms of volatility and return between Bitcoin and key asset classes. Second, Bitcoin has experienced a rapid growth since around a decade and a number of investors are showing interest in its potential as an integrative part of portfolio diversification. The information provided by empirical results gives empirical bases from which to address topics concerning hedging purposes and optimal portfolio allocation. It is also increasingly important to analyze the current behavior of Bitcoin in relation to other assets to provide policy makers and regulatory bodies with guidance on the role of the Bitcoin as an investment asset in Turkey. Thus, this is the first serious attempt at exploring the potential for Bitcoin to offer diversification opportunities in the context of Turkey.

TI Blockchain adoption for information sharing: risk decision-making in
   spacecraft supply chain
SO ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB This research studies the risk decision-making (RDM) problem faced by participants in a spacecraft supply chain, considering the adoption of the blockchain technology to facilitate information sharing. We investigate a three-level spacecraft supply chain composed of a spacecraft builder, supplier, and logistics service integrator with the Stackelberg game under the scenarios of decentralized, partially centralized, and fully centralized decision-making. For each scenario, we show how the spacecraft builder?s optimal order quantity and the supplier?s application degree of the blockchain technology change with the spacecraft builder?s risk coefficient. We also compare the overall profit of the supply chain for three decision-making scenarios.

TI Authentication Protocol for Cloud Databases Using Blockchain Mechanism
SO SENSORS
AB Cloud computing has made the software development process fast and flexible but on the other hand it has contributed to increasing security attacks. Employees who manage the data in cloud companies may face insider attack, affecting their reputation. They have the advantage of accessing the user data by interacting with the authentication mechanism. The primary aim of this research paper is to provide a novel secure authentication mechanism by using Blockchain technology for cloud databases. Blockchain makes it difficult to change user login credentials details in the user authentication process by an insider. The insider is not able to access the user authentication data due to the distributed ledger-based authentication scheme. Activity of insider can be traced and cannot be changed. Both insider and outsider user's are authenticated using individual IDs and signatures. Furthermore, the user access control on the cloud database is also authenticated. The algorithm and theorem of the proposed mechanism have been given to demonstrate the applicability and correctness.The proposed mechanism is tested on the Scyther formal system tool against denial of service, impersonation, offine guessing, and no replay attacks. Scyther results show that the proposed methodology is secure cum robust.

TI A Novel Decision-Making Model with Pythagorean Fuzzy Linguistic
   Information Measures and Its Application to a Sustainable Blockchain
   Product Assessment Problem
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study presents a novel multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) model on the basis of Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic information measures. To do so, we first present a new concept of Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic sets to describe fuzziness and inconsistent information, in which the Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic values (PFLVs) are represented by the linguistic membership degree and linguistic non-membership degree. Then, we introduce two axiomatic definitions of information measures for PFLVs, including Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic entropy and the Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic similarity measure, to measure the uncertainty degree of PFLVs and the similarity degree between among PFLVs. In addition, based on the logarithmic function, we construct two new information measure formulas and verify that they satisfy the axiomatic conditions of the Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic entropy and similarity measure, respectively. We further explore the relationship between the Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic entropy and similarity measure. Finally, we present a novel Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic MADM model with the Pythagorean fuzzy linguistic entropy and similarity measure. A numerical example of selecting the most desirable sustainable blockchain product is given, and a comparison with the existing approach was performed to validate the reliability of the developed decision-making model.

TI PRICHAIN: A Partially Decentralized Implementation of UbiPri Middleware
   Using Blockchain
SO SENSORS
AB With the popularization of the Internet-of-Things, various applications have emerged to make life easier. These applications generate a large amount of user data. Analyzing the data obtained from these applications, one can infer personal information about each user. Considering this, it is clear that ensuring privacy in this type of application is essential. To guarantee privacy various solutions exist, one of them is UbiPri middleware. This paper presents a decentralized implementation of UbiPri middleware using the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts were used in conjunction with a communication gateway and a distributed storage service to ensure users privacy. The results obtained show that the implementation of this work ensures privacy at different levels, data storage security, and performance regarding scalability in the Internet of Things environments.

TI Blockchain as a medium for transindividual collective
SO CULTURE THEORY AND CRITIQUE
AB Today, digitalisation is penetrating every corner of our mundane life, thus affecting our being in manifold ways. In spite of this, digital technologies provide us with paths towards advancing humanity. One way to model the possibilities of the new technologies in a sustainable way is to frame them in light of Gilbert Simondon's philosophy and especially his understanding of 'transindividuality', which is the foundation for a robust, evolving collective. The transindividual relation, mediated by technical objects, is the possibility of a concurrent problem-solving at the collective and individual level. One of these new technologies, blockchain, a decentralised peer-to-peer database, practically demonstrates a complex system that can cultivate this transindividuality. Although not without its flaws, blockchain nonetheless presents a serious innovation for collective being.

TI Non-fundamental, non-parametric Bitcoin forecasting
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency in the world, but its lack of quantitative qualities makes fundamental analysis of its intrinsic value difficult. As an alternative valuation and forecasting method we propose a non-parametric model based on technical analysis. Using simple technical indicators, we produce point and density forecasts of Bitcoin returns with a feedforward neural network. We run several models over the full period of April 2011-March 2018, and four subsamples, and we find that backpropagation neural networks dominate various competing models in terms of their forecast accuracy. We conclude that the dynamics of Bitcoin returns is characterized by predictive local non-linear trends that reflect the speculative nature of cryptocurrency trading. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI False Image Injection Prevention Using iChain
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The advances in information and communication technology are consistently beneficial for the healthcare sector. A trend in the healthcare sector is the progressive shift in how data are acquired and the storage of such data in different facilities, such as in the cloud, due to the efficiency and effectiveness offered. Digital images related to healthcare are sensitive in nature and require maximum security and privacy. A malicious entity can tamper with such stored digital images to mislead healthcare personnel and the consequences of wrong diagnosis are harmful for both parties. A new type of cyber attack, a false image injection attack (FIIA) is introduced in this paper. Existing image tampering detection measures are unable to guarantee tamper-proof medical data in real time. Inspired by the effectiveness of emerging blockchain technology, a security framework, image chain (iChain) is proposed in this paper to ensure the security and privacy of the sensitive healthcare images. The practical challenges associated with the proposed framework and further research that is required are also highlighted.

TI Legal Regulation of Digital Money Issuance and Circulation
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article considers the issues of legal regulation of new forms of money that have appeared quite recently or may appear in the coming years. At this stage of development, their legal status is not determined, and Russia will have to choose the most appropriate model for their regulation. First of all, the trends in the development of money forms are researched, since it is the development of information technologies that made the emergence of the phenomenon of digital money (cryptocurrency) possible. The authors note that the concepts of digital money and electronic money are mixed in Russia, which is quite incorrect. Only electronic money in Russia is currently the official legal category while new forms of digital money are still outside the legal field. The next important issue is the choice of a regulatory model for the use of digital money. The authors distinguish two models. In the first model, the issuer of digital money is the central bank. At the same time, the functions of the central bank are to develop their own decentralized system, in which a single type of cryptocurrency will circulate. In accordance with the second model, the functions of the central bank include only the licensing of financial organizations and other participants to conduct operations with private cryptocurrencies. The authors note that, despite global trends in the use of "private money", it cannot be fully recognized as money, since the essence of money is revealed through its functions, and modem private cryptocurrencies cannot perform all the necessary functions, but only individual ones. It seems that due to national traditions and a high degree of centralization of public administration, the first model seems preferable for Russia. At the same time, an attempt to regulate and create digital money issued by central banks can be an impetus for the actual formation of new types of monetary systems based on the use of, e.g., private digital money. In the course of the work, the authors explore the legal aspects of regulating the issue of digital money by the Bank of Russia and come to the conclusion that, when deciding on the implementation of the first model of using digital money, neither the Constitution of the Russian Federation nor the Civil Code contain restrictions on issuance of digital money by the Russian Central Bank. The main restrictions, which are analyzed in this article, are enshrined in the Federal Law "On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)", since this law does not provide for the powers of the Bank of Russia to issue its own national digital currency. In this regard, the authors propose to eliminate these restrictions and expand the powers of the Bank of Russia to issue digital money for a wide range of people. Amendments to the federal law proposed in the work will allow creating a more flexible and reliable system of payments based on digital money of the Central Bank and will strengthen the financial inclusion for different segments of the population.

TI Blockchain in IoT Systems: End-to-End Delay Evaluation
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Providing security and privacy for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications while ensuring a minimum level of performance requirements is an open research challenge. Recently, blockchain offers a promising solution to overcome the current peer-to-peer networks limitations. In the context of IoT, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)-based consensus protocols are used due to the energy efficiency advantage over other consensus protocols. The consensus process in BFT is done by electing a group of authenticated nodes. The elected nodes will be responsible for ensuring the data blocks' integrity through defining a total order on the blocks and preventing the concurrently appended blocks from containing conflicting data. However, the blockchain consensus layer contributes the most performance overhead. Therefore, a performance study needs to be conducted especially for the IoT applications that are subject to maximum delay constraints. In this paper, we obtain a mathematical expression to calculate the end-to-end delay with different network configurations, i.e., number of network hops and replica machines. We validate the proposed analytical model with simulation. Our results show that the unique characteristics of IoT traffic have an undeniable impact on the end-to-end delay requirement.

TI A blockchain-based certificateless public key signature scheme for
   vehicle-to-infrastructure communication in VANETs
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have been developing based on the state-of-art in wireless network communication technologies to improve traffic on roads. However, there are some threats to security and privacy due to the open wireless environment in VANETs and the high speed of vehicles. The authentication of messages related to traffic which are exchanged with the vehicles and the Road-Side Unit (RSU) is considered one of the most VANETs necessary security requirements. In this context, several schemes have been designed to secure the traffic-related messages in VANETs. However, these schemes suffer from high computational costs in signatures' verification. To minimize the computational cost of signature generation and verification, we propose an efficient Certificateless Public Key Signature (CL-PKS) scheme using bilinear pairing to provide conditional privacy-preserving authentication for Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) communication in VANETs. The CL-PKS scheme supports batch signature verification and aggregate signature verification functions to speed up verification process. In addition to this, we include blockchain to our CL-PKS scheme to implement revocation transparency of pseudo-identities efficiently before verifying the signatures. Furthermore, this scheme provides security proof and protection against different types of attacks. The proposed scheme incurs lower computational cost as compared to that incurred by existing schemes.

TI BLOCKCHAIN PLATFORM FOR REAL-TIME PAYMENTS: A LESS COSTLY AND MORE
   SECURE ALTERNATIVE TO ACH
SO TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
AB This paper examines the historical development of banking and automated clearing house legacy systems and offers blockchain platform for real-time payments as an alternative. Institutions with legacy systems resist disruptive change unless there are demands by businesses and customers and an opportunity for new products at reduced costs and additional revenues. Although the Automated Clearing House (ACH) in the U.S. has phased in a twice-a-day clearing and settlement system, it is still behind real-time models in use in several other countries. ACH uses individual clearance and settlements for large payments and batches for smaller transactions. Using ACH data, this paper calculates the annual opportunity cost of using a real-time model such as blockchain versus ACH's discrete, twice-a-day clearance and settlement procedure. For 2016, the real-time protocol would have resulted in benefits for businesses and customers of $10 billion.

TI Cryptocurrencies and blockchain in tourism as a strategy to reduce
   poverty
SO RETOS-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS DE LA ADMINISTRACION Y ECONOMIA
AB Poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean continues to be a problem with no apparent solution. In this article is proposed the use of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a tool to reduce poverty in the region through economic activities from tourism. A detailed analysis of the potentialities collected by tourism, cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology was carried out. Due to the tourism capabilities of the Latin American and Caribbean regions, a set of efforts must be made by governments and private companies to implement tourism development in regions and locations with great biodiversity and cultural resources not yet explored. The relative access to bitcoin accounts through smartphones means that financial transactions through cryptocurrencies are available to small merchants who normally do not have access to traditional bank accounts. On the other hand, access to the internet via mobile telephony must be further strengthened to facilitate payment systems and so that blockchain-based technologies can be developed at maximum capacity. It is concluded that in order to achieve a significant reduction of poverty. it is necessary an adequate regulation of the cryptocurrencies by the governments as well as the development of an adequate infrastructure that allows the creation and / or recovery of microenterprises boosted by the "Initial Coin Offering" (ICO).

TI Security and privacy of mobile wallet users in Bitcoin, Dash, Monero,
   and Zcash
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Mobile devices play an increasingly important role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, yet their privacy guarantees remain unstudied. To verify transactions, they either trust a server or use simple payment verification.
   First, we review the security and privacy of popular Android wallets for Bitcoin and the three major privacy-focused cryptocurrencies (Dash, Monero, Zcash). Then, we investigate the network-level properties of cryptocurrencies and propose a method of transaction clustering based on timing analysis. We implement and test our method on selected wallets and show that a moderately resourceful attacker can correlate transactions issued from one device with relatively high accuracy.

TI Analysis of barriers to implement blockchain in industry and service
   sectors
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Blockchain technology holds immense potential for industries and services by executing transactions in a verifiable and permanent way. It operates as an open distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties. However, the adoption and implementation of blockchain technologies in various industries and services is a challenging task. In this study, we develop a framework for investigating barriers to the adoption and successful implementation of blockchains across different industries and services, using DEMATEL technique. We identify these barriers with the help of extant literature and experts' opinions and further classify them into ten broad categories. Then, we establish the causal relationships among those barriers and rank them based on their degree of prominence and relationships. We find that challenges in scalability and market-based risks are the most influencing barriers. Whereas high sustainability costs and poor economic behavior are the most influenced barriers during successful blockchain adoption. Finally, we perform a series of sensitivity analysis to test the robustness and generalizability of our proposed framework. Findings from our study will be beneficial for managers and help to eliminate the major barriers in the efficient implementation of blockchain technologies in their organizations.

TI Disruptive Technologies for Environment and Health Research: An Overview
   of Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, and Internet of Things
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The purpose of this descriptive research paper is to initiate discussions on the use of innovative technologies and their potential to support the research and development of pan-Canadian monitoring and surveillance activities associated with environmental impacts on health and within the health system. Its primary aim is to provide a review of disruptive technologies and their current uses in the environment and in healthcare. Drawing on extensive experience in population-level surveillance through the use of technology, knowledge from prior projects in the field, and conducting a review of the technologies, this paper is meant to serve as the initial steps toward a better understanding of the research area. In doing so, we hope to be able to better assess which technologies might best be leveraged to advance this unique intersection of health and environment. This paper first outlines the current use of technologies at the intersection of public health and the environment, in particular, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). The paper provides a description for each of these technologies, along with a summary of their current applications, and a description of the challenges one might face with adopting them. Thereafter, a high-level reference architecture, that addresses the challenges of the described technologies and could potentially be incorporated into the pan-Canadian surveillance system, is conceived and presented.

TI Creating consensus group using online learning based reputation in
   blockchain networks
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB One of the biggest challenges to blockchain technology is the scalability problem. The choice of consensus algorithm is critical to the practical solution of the scalability problem. To increase scalability, Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) based methods have been most widely applied. This study proposes a new model instead of Proof of Work (PoW) for forming the consensus group that allows the use of BFT based methods in the public blockchain network. The proposed model uses the adaptive hedge method, which is a decision-theoretic online learning algorithm (Qi et al., 2016). The reputation value is calculated for the nodes that want to participate in the consensus committee, and nodes with high reputation values are selected for the consensus committee to reduce the chances of the nodes in the consensus committee being harmful. Since the study focuses on the formation of the consensus group, a simulated blockchain network is used to test the proposed model more effectively. Test results indicate that the proposed model, which is a new approach in the literature making use of machine learning for the construction of consensus committee, successfully selects the node with the higher reputation for the consensus group.

TI DEPLEST: A blockchain-based privacy-preserving distributed database
   toward user behaviors in social networks
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Social networks record a significant amount of user behavior data every day. By analyzing this behavior data, companies or attackers use it for marketing or more questionable purposes. We propose a blockchain-based model to protect the privacy of users' data in such big data environments. Traditional blockchain methods require too many resources for this task, so we propose a model that secures sensitive user information in a distributed blockchain and passes nonsensitive information through to the primary system in order to manage the blockchain size. Our DEPLEST algorithm performs these synchronization operations to keep local database storage and computational capacity within the limits of individual users' devices. We also propose a consensus protocol for blockchain ledger maintenance that runs well on typical client systems and prove that this protocol has excellent Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). Our experimental results show that DEPLEST meets the architectural and performance needs and that our consensus protocol outperforms the existing proof of work (PoW) and proof of stake (PoS) methods in this application.

SO ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB At time of crisis, relief teams must have assured connectivity, not only just within the team but also across different service agencies in the area. Since emergency agencies and essential services always send service cars to affected zones, advanced technologies and computing resources aboard these vehicles can be pooled together to boost network capacity temporarily, just where it is crucially needed. These vehicles become automotive virtual edge communicators (AVECs). They are managed by a vehicular inter-agency service orchestration and resourcing (ViSOR) system that creates transient proximity-based "trust circles" to manage novel cooperative hosting, opportunistic virtualization, and "car sourcing" of crisis zone data. This study evaluates the feasibility for this challenging but highly rewarding concept and identifies gaps in emerging technologies.

SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Internet of Things (IoT) is reshaping the incumbent industry to smart industry featured with data-driven decision-making. However, intrinsic features of IoT result in a number of challenges, such as decentralization, poor interoperability, privacy, and security vulnerabilities. Blockchain technology brings the opportunities in addressing the challenges of IoT. In this paper, we investigate the integration of blockchain technology with IoT. We name such synthesis of blockchain and IoT as blockchain of things (BCoT). This paper presents an in-depth survey of BCoT and discusses the insights of this new paradigm. In particular, we first briefly introduce IoT and discuss the challenges of IoT. Then, we give an overview of blockchain technology. We next concentrate on introducing the convergence of blockchain and IoT and presenting the proposal of BCoT architecture. We further discuss the issues about using blockchain for fifth generation beyond in IoT as well as industrial applications of BCoT. Finally, we outline the open research directions in this promising area.

TI From old to new: From internet to smart contracts and from people to
   smart contracts
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB Discussing legal issues related to smart contracts on the blockchain is very topical. This article will discuss primarily smart contracts on the blockchain the conclusion and execution of which does not interact with the physical world, as well as briefly touch upon smart contracts on the blockchain which do interact with the physical world. For these smart contracts, it will be determined to what extent existing EU internet laws can help support their development and if not, what is needed to support this. In order to answer this question, the following will be discussed: the rise of e-commerce and in particular the EU internet laws supporting and regulating e-commerce, how smart contracts work and how smart contracts compare with existing technological developments and comparable legal constructs (internet, bank accounts and bank guarantees). Subsequently, it will be explained how the use of smart contracts leads to a shift of confidence, from trust in people to trust in code. On the basis of The DAO hack and the problems that arose, it will be illustrated that this shift to trust in code is not as absolute as is often thought. The article concludes that applying specific EU laws on supporting and regulating e-commerce to smart contracts is difficult for two reasons. First of all, the starting points differ: trust in people versus trust in code. Secondly, technical and practical obstacles often inhibit applying internet laws in a meaningful manner. When using smart contracts, it makes more sense to prevent problems from arising than to correct them afterwards. For this reason, it is advocated that programmers work together with lawyers to create better smart contracts and that the legislator focuses on laws dealing with auditing smart contracts code by trusted third parties and automatically equating smart contracts with written contracts with wet ink signatures. This will hopefully facilitate the rise of smart contracts on the blockchain. (C) 2019 T.J. de Graaf. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Consumer Demand for Blockchain-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading
   in the United Kingdom: An Online Survey Experiment
SO ENERGIES
AB Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading could help address grid management challenges in a decentralizing electricity system, as well as provide other social and environmental benefits. Many existing and proposed trading schemes are enabled by blockchain, a distributed ledger technology (DLT) relying on cryptographic proof of ownership rather than human intermediaries to establish energy transactions. This study used an online survey experiment (n = 2064) to investigate how consumer demand for blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer energy trading schemes in the United Kingdom varies depending on how the consumer proposition is designed and communicated. The analysis provides some evidence of a preference for schemes offering to meet a higher proportion of participants' energy needs and for those operating at the city/region (as compared to national or neighbourhood) level. People were more likely to say they would participate when the scheme was framed as being run by their local council, followed by an energy supplier, community energy organization, and social media company. Anonymity was the most valued DLT characteristic and mentioning blockchain's association with Bitcoin led to a substantial decrease in intended uptake. We highlight a range of important questions and implications suggested by these findings for the introduction and operation of P2P trading schemes.

TI Is Bitcoin a Commodity? On price jumps, demand shocks, and certainty of
   supply
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MONEY AND FINANCE
AB This paper discusses how similar Bitcoin is to a commodity. The application of a number of both linear and non-linear GARCH models indicates that the role of extreme price movements is particularly pronounced. GARCH models with student-t innovations as well as combined jump-GARCH models are among the models with the best fit. The role of large movements is found to be stronger in the Bitcoin market than in the markets for crude oil and gold. As Bitcoin shares with these exhaustible resource commodities characteristics such as the fixed supply, the analysis of Bitcoin prices can generally learn from the analysis of exhaustible resource commodities. However, whereas the short-run supply of gold and oil are uncertain, there are no uncertainties on the Bitcoin supply-side. Thus, the observed movements of Bitcoin prices can be interpreted as results of Bitcoin demand shocks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Review of Blockchain based Educational Projects
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain is a decentralized and shared distributed ledger that records the transaction history done by totally different nodes within the whole network. The technology is practically used in the field of education for record-keeping, digital certification, etc. There have already been several papers published on this, but no one can't find a single paper covering the blockchain-based educational projects. So, There is a gap of latest trends to education. Blockchain-based educational projects resolve the issues of today's educators. On that basis, we conclude that there is a need for conducting a systematic literature review. This study, therefore, reviews the artistic gap between these two based on educational projects. For this purpose, the paper focuses on exploring some block-chain based projects and protocols that are used in these projects. It also analyses the block-chain features that are being used and the services are offered by the existing educational projects using block-chain features to improve the execution of this technology in education.

TI A Fair Blockchain Based on Proof of Credit
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB Proof of work and proof of stake (PoS) are commonly used in the current permissionless blockchains. These consensus protocols can be abstracted into a random process of selecting a node for accounting in a blockchain ledger. However, they are generally faced with resource consumption and vulnerability issues. We present proof of credit (PoC), a fair blockchain protocol based on the PoC blockchain protocol. It is a special PoS protocol where the credit is a special kind of stake quantifying whether the node's activity is beneficial to the system. Any nodes cannot change their credits arbitrarily. We demonstrate that our PoC protocol satisfies the security properties, including common prefix, chain quality, and chain growth, under the assumption that the total credit the honest held is majority. In addition, we propose a self-audit mechanism and a hybrid incentive mechanism to enhance the security and stability. Finally, we explain the method by which the PoC protocol resists the double-spending attacks and the selfish mining attacks.

TI Smart contract-based approach for efficient shipment management
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Efficient tracking of shipments is critical in managing global trade and logistics activities. The volume of global container movement combined with information opaqueness and process complexity necessitates implementing a robust technology solution with real time tracking capabilities. Blockchain is an emerging technology that offers the necessary platform to track and manage shipment movements in the supply chain using a peer-to-peer, secured, distributed ledger, and without intermediaries or trusted third parties. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution for efficient supply chain management involving items shipped via smart containers. Our proposed solution utilizes the features of smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain to govern and manage interactions between the sender and receiver. Shipped items are included in smart containers equipped with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors that can be used to track and monitor predefined shipping conditions related to temperature, geographical location, humidity, pressure, light exposure, sudden fall, broken seal, etc. Ethereum smart contracts are used to manage shipment conditions, automate payments, legitimize receiver and also issue a refund in case of violations to predefined conditions. In the paper, we present and discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, information flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality with a potential business case applied to vaccine supply chain. The Smart contracts were implemented in Solidity language and tested using Remix IDE environment, the code has been made publicly available for academic, research and practice community.

Most importantly, in the healthcare industry, this has become more and more involved with the information and communication technology-based services. One of the most important services is monitoring of remote patients, that enables the healthcare providers to observe, diagnose and prescribe the patients without being physically present. The advantage of miniaturization of sensor technologies gives the flexibility of installing in, on or off the body of patients, which is capable of forwarding physiological data wirelessly to remote servers. Such technology is named as Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). In this paper, WBAN architecture, communication technologies for WBAN, challenges and different aspects of WBAN are illustrated. This paper also describes the architectural limitations of existing WBAN communication frameworks. blueFurthermore, implementation requirements are presented based on IEEE 802.15.6 standard.

AB Blockchain is a promising information technology which can provide several potential applications related to operations and supply chains. By using distributed software architecture and advanced computing, blockchain can solve the problem of immutable ledgers distributed to several actors in the chain. This paper reviews blockchain technology and outlines possible uses for immutable distributed ledgers in operations and supply chains. A classification of the applications of blockchain technology in the scope of operations and supply chain management is presented. In order to demonstrate the technical architecture of the blockchain-based logistics monitoring system (BLMS), a reference implementation was programmed and tested based on Ethereum. The purpose of the BLMS is to provide a solution for parcel tracking in a supply chain to support an open and immutable history record for each transaction. The functionality of the system consists of transaction entry for logistics operators. The presented reference architecture demonstrates how blockchain can be implemented in the operations and supply chain context by using software components.

TI How Does Information Transmission Influence the Value Creation
   Capability of a Digital Ecosystem? An Empirical Study of the
   Crypto-Digital Ecosystem Ethereum
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB With the advancement of digitization, digital ecosystems are playing an increasingly important role in value creation. The mechanism by which digital ecosystems create value, however, has been generally deemed to be a mixed effect due to various factors. On the basis of signaling theory, this paper explores the effect of information transmission on the value creation capability of a digital ecosystem from two dimensions: the scale and sustainability of value creation. Taking a sample of weekly transaction data from Ethereum during August 2015-August 2018, our research proposes an integrated framework of information transmission in value creating, and discusses the diffusion process of the network effect within the digital ecosystem. As a generally accepted exchange medium, digital currency traffic acts as an observable proxy of information flow in a crypto-digital ecosystem, where the effects of heterogeneity in transaction attributes are filtered. Empirical results show that information transmission positively influences the scale and sustainability of value creation activities in a digital ecosystem by affecting user number and transaction frequency. Further research reveals that user number is the initial driving force of the network effect and a critical factor for the overall ecosystem market capitalization. This research provides a new insight into the design of sustainable value creation mechanisms under digital circumstances.

   Challenges, Recommendations and Future Direction
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Blockchain in healthcare applications requires robust security and privacy mechanism for high-level authentication, interoperability and medical records sharing to comply with the strict legal requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Blockchain technology in the healthcare industry has received considerable research attention in recent years. This study conducts a review to substantially analyse and map the research landscape of current technologies, mainly the use of blockchain in healthcare applications, into a coherent taxonomy. The present study systematically searches all relevant research articles on blockchain in healthcare applications in three accessible databases, namely, ScienceDirect, IEEE and Web of Science, by using the defined keywords 'blockchain', 'healthcare' and 'electronic health records' and their variations. The final set of collected articles related to the use of blockchain in healthcare application is divided into three categories. The first category includes articles (i.e. 43/58 scientific articles) that attempted to develop and design healthcare applications integrating blockchain, particularly those on new architecture, system designs, framework, scheme, model, platform, approach, protocol and algorithm. The second category includes studies (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) that attempted to evaluate and analyse the adoption of blockchain in the healthcare system. Finally, the third category comprises review and survey articles (i.e., 6/58 scientific articles) related to the integration of blockchain into healthcare applications. The final articles for review are discussed on the basis of five aspects: (1) year of publication, (2) nationality of authors, (3) publishing house or journal, (4) purpose of using blockchain in health applications and the corresponding contributions and ((5)) problem types and proposed solutions. Additionally, this study provides identified motivations, open challenges and recommendations on the use of blockchain in healthcare applications. The current research contributes to the literature by providing a detailed review of feasible alternatives and identifying the research gaps. Accordingly, researchers and developers are provided with appealing opportunities to further develop decentralised healthcare applications through a comprehensive discussion of about the importance of blockchain and its integration into various healthcare applications.

TI BUAV: A Blockchain Based Secure UAV-Assisted Data Acquisition Scheme in
   Internet of Things
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB Internet of things (IoT), mobile edge computing (MEC), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have attracted significant attention in both industry and academic research. By consolidating these technologies, IoT can be facilitated with improved connectivity, better data transmission, energy saving, and other advantages. However, the communication between these entities is subject to potential cyber threats. In addition, the integrity of the data must be maintained after storing into local storage. Blockchain is a data structure that supports features like pseudonymity, data integrity etc. This paper represents a blockchain based data acquisition process in which information is gathered from IoTs using UAV as a relay and is securely kept in blockchain at MEC server. In the proposed scheme, data are encrypted prior to transfer to MEC server with the assistance of a UAV. Upon receiving the data, MEC server validates the data and the identity of the sender. Successful validation is followed by stocking of the data into blockchain, subsequent to obtaining consent from the validators. Security analysis is conducted in order to show the feasibility of the proposed secure scheme. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed via simulation and implementation.

TI A Review of Blockchain Architecture and Consensus Protocols: Use Cases,
   Challenges, and Solutions
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Over the last decade, blockchain technology has emerged to provide solutions to the complexity and privacy challenges of using distributed databases. It reduces cost for customers by eliminating intermediaries and builds trust in peer-to-peer communications. Over this time, the concept of blockchain has shifted greatly due to its potential in business growth for enterprises and the rapidly evolving applications in a collaborative smart-city ecosystem, healthcare, and governance. Many platforms, with different architectures and consensus protocols, have been introduced. Consequently, it becomes challenging for an application developer to choose the right platform. Furthermore, blockchain has misaligned with the goals for an efficient green collaborative digital ecosystem. Therefore, it becomes critical to address this gap and to build new frameworks to align blockchain with those goals. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of blockchain architecture and consensus protocols, bringing a retrospective analysis and discussing the rationale of the evolution of the various architectures and protocols, as well as capturing the assumptions conducive to their development and contributions to building collaborative applications. We introduce a classification of those architectures helping developers to choose a suitable platform for applications and providing insights for future research directions in the field to build new frameworks.

TI Digital health and nursing The future is now
SO PNEUMOLOGE
AB The digitalization of healthcare systems is no longer a trend but a reality, which is driven by the rapid developments in the fields of medicine, information and communication technology (ICT). It revolutionizes the practice of medicine by making innovative treatment forms possible by the accelerated exchange of patient data. In this way it brings tremendous advantages to all stakeholders in healthcare delivery. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity, the decreasing number of physicians, long distances and poor road infrastructure between doctors and patients create loopholes in the delivery of healthcare services, especially in rural regions, which can at least partially be filled by the use of telemedicine. The acceptance of ehealth is the most important success factor in its use for the management of patients. User-friendliness, efficiency, effectiveness, legal safety and reimbursement of telemedical services are the important conditions for this. Furthermore, training and continuing training of healthcare personnel also drive the development of telemedicine. Factors delaying the use of telemedicine are partial lack of reimbursement and lack of interoperability among different systems of medical technology. Pilot projects serve to provide evidence for the usefulness and effectiveness of telemedicine. They also help to build the structural foundation on which telemedicine can develop. Examples of such projects are emergency triage, online video consultations and digital care projects. There are many emerging trends in the field of digital health, which are developing at different paces. Examples of such trends are artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and augmented reality.

TI Banning bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB We employ a monetary model with endogenous search and random consumption preferences to consider the extent to which a government can ban an alternative currency, like bitcoin. We define a ban as a policy whereby government agents refuse to accept an alternative currency and mete out punishments to private agents caught using it. After identifying monetary equilibria where an alternative currency is accepted, we then derive the conditions under which a ban might deter its use. As in earlier studies, we show that a government of sufficient size can prevent an alternative currency from circulating without relying on punishments. We also show that, given its size, a government can ban an alternative currency so long as it is willing and able to mete out sufficiently severe punishments. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI CloudRPS: a cloud analysis based enhanced ransomware prevention system
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Recently, indiscriminate ransomware attacks targeting a wide range of victims for monetary gains have become a worldwide social issue. In the early years, ransomware has used e-mails as attack method. The most common spreading method was through spam mail or harmful websites. In addition, social networking sites or smartphone messages are used. Ransomware can encrypt the user's files and issues a warning message to the user and requests payment through bitcoin, which is a virtual currency that is hard to trace. It is possible to analyze ransomware but this has its limitations as new ransomware is being continuously created and disseminated. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ransomware prevention system based on abnormal behavior analysis and detection in cloud analysis system-CloudRPS. This proposed system can defend against ransomware through more in-depth prevention. It can monitors the network, file, and server in real time. Furthermore, it installs a cloud system to collect and analyze various information from the device and log information to defend against attacks. Finally, the goal of the system is to minimize the possibility of the early intrusion. And it can detect the attack quickly more to prevent at the user's system in case of the ransomware compromises.

TI Dynamic Access Control Policy based on Blockchain and Machine Learning
   for the Internet of Things
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is now destroying the barriers between the real and digital worlds. However, one of the huge problems that can slow down the development of this global wave, or even stop it, concerns security and privacy requirements. The criticality of these latter comes especially from the fact that the smart objects may contain very intimate information or even may be responsible for protecting people's lives. In this paper, the focus is on access control in the IoT context by proposing a dynamic and fully distributed security policy. Our proposal will be based, on one hand, on the concept of the blockchain to ensure the distributed aspect strongly recommended in the IoT; and on the other hand on machine learning algorithms, particularly on reinforcement learning category, in order to provide a dynamic, optimized and self-adjusted security policy.

AB Cloud computing has become an irreversible trend. Together comes the pressing need for verifiability, to assure the client the correctness of computation outsourced to the cloud. Existing verifiable computation techniques all have a high overhead, thus if being deployed in the clouds, would render cloud computing more expensive than the on-premises counterpart. To achieve verifiability at a reasonable cost, we leverage game theory and propose a smart contract based solution. In a nutshell, a client lets two clouds compute the same task, and uses smart contracts to stimulate tension, betrayal and distrust between the clouds, so that rational clouds will not collude and cheat. In the absence of collusion, verification of correctness can be done easily by crosschecking the results from the two clouds. We provide a formal analysis of the games induced by the contracts, and prove that the contracts will be effective under certain reasonable assumptions. By resorting to game theory and smart contracts, we are able to avoid heavy cryptographic protocols. The client only needs to pay two clouds to compute in the clear, and a small transaction fee to use the smart contracts. We also conducted a feasibility study that involves implementing the contracts in Solidity and running them on the official Ethereum network.

While expectations are high, real world impact and benefit are still unclear. To be able to assess its impact, the first structured literature review of peer-reviewed articles is conducted. As blockchain technology is centered around a peer-to-peer network, enabling collaboration between different parties, the service system is chosen as unit analysis to examine its potential contribution. We have identified a set of characteristics that enable trust and decentralization, facilitating the formation and coordination of a service system.

TI Fraud detections for online businesses: a perspective from blockchain
   technology
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Background: The reputation system has been designed as an effective mechanism to reduce risks associated with online shopping for customers. However, it is vulnerable to rating fraud. Some raters may inject unfairly high or low ratings to the system so as to promote their own products or demote their competitors.
   Method: This study explores the rating fraud by differentiating the subjective fraud from objective fraud. Then it discusses the effectiveness of blockchain technology in objective fraud and its limitation in subjective fraud, especially the rating fraud. Lastly, it systematically analyzes the robustness of blockchain-based reputation systems in each type of rating fraud.
   Results: The detection of fraudulent raters is not easy since they can behave strategically to camouflage themselves. We explore the potential strengths and limitations of blockchain-based reputation systems under two attack goals: ballot-stuffing and bad-mouthing, and various attack models including constant attack, camouflage attack, whitewashing attack and sybil attack. Blockchain-based reputation systems are more robust against bad-mouthing than ballot-stuffing fraud.
   Conclusions: Blockchain technology provides new opportunities for redesigning the reputation system. Blockchain systems are very effective in preventing objective information fraud, such as loan application fraud, where fraudulent information is fact-based. However, their effectiveness is limited in subjective information fraud, such as rating fraud, where the ground-truth is not easily validated. Blockchain systems are effective in preventing bad mouthing and whitewashing attack, but they are limited in detecting ballot-stuffing under sybil attack, constant attacks and camouflage attack.

TI Doxing: a conceptual analysis
SO ETHICS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Doxing is the intentional public release onto the Internet of personal information about an individual by a third party, often with the intent to humiliate, threaten, intimidate, or punish the identified individual. In this paper I present a conceptual analysis of the practice of doxing and how it differs from other forms of privacy violation. I distinguish between three types of doxing: deanonymizing doxing, where personal information establishing the identity of a formerly anonymous individual is released; targeting doxing, that discloses personal information that reveals specific details of an individual's circumstances that are usually private, obscure, or obfuscated; and delegitimizing doxing, which reveals intimate personal information that damages the credibility of that individual. I also describe how doxing differs from blackmail and defamation. I argue that doxing may be justified in cases where it reveals wrongdoing (such as deception), but only if the information released is necessary to reveal that such wrongdoing has occurred and if it is in the public interest to reveal such wrongdoing. Revealing additional information, such as that which allows an individual to be targeted for harassment and intimidation, is unjustified. I illustrate my discussion with the examples of the alleged identification of the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, by Newsweek magazine, the identification of the notorious Reddit user Violentacrez by the blog Gawker, and the harassment of game developer Zoe Quinn in the 'GamerGate' Internet campaign.

TI Predicting Fluctuations in Cryptocurrency Transactions Based on User
   Comments and Replies
SO PLOS ONE
AB This paper proposes a method to predict fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies, which are increasingly used for online transactions worldwide. Little research has been conducted on predicting fluctuations in the price and number of transactions of a variety of cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the few methods proposed to predict fluctuation in currency prices are inefficient because they fail to take into account the differences in attributes between real currencies and cryptocurrencies. This paper analyzes user comments in online cryptocurrency communities to predict fluctuations in the prices of cryptocurrencies and the number of transactions. By focusing on three cryptocurrencies, each with a large market size and user base, this paper attempts to predict such fluctuations by using a simple and efficient method.

TI Evaluating Prostate Cancer Using Fractional Tissue Composition of
   Radical Prostatectomy Specimens and Pre-Operative Diffusional Kurtosis
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Evaluating tissue heterogeneity using non-invasive imaging could potentially improve prostate cancer assessment and treatment.
   Methods
   20 patients with intermediate/high-risk prostate cancer underwent diffusion kurtosis imaging, including calculation of apparent diffusion (D-app) and kurtosis (K-app), prior to radical prostatectomy. Whole-mount tissue composition was quantified into: cellularity, luminal space, and fibromuscular stroma. Peripheral zone tumors were subdivided according to Gleason score.
   Results
   Peripheral zone tumors had increased cellularity (p<0.0001), decreased fibromuscular stroma (p<0.05) and decreased luminal space (p<0.0001). Gleason score >= 4+3 tumors had significantly increased cellularity and decreased fibromuscular stroma compared to Gleason score <= 3+4 (p<0.05). In tumors, there was a significant positive correlation between median K-app and cellularity (rho = 0.50; p<0.05), and a negative correlation with fibromuscular stroma (rho =-0.45; p<0.05). In normal tissue, median Dapp had a significant positive correlation with luminal space (rho = 0.65; p<0.05) and a negative correlation with cellularity (rho =-0.49; p<0.05). Median K-app and D-app varied significantly between tumor and normal tissue (p<0.0001), but only median K-app was significantly different between Gleason score >= 4+3 and <= 3+4 (p<0.05).
   Conclusions
   Peripheral zone tumors have increased cellular heterogeneity which is reflected in mean K-app, while normal prostate has a more homogeneous luminal space and cellularity better represented by D-app.

SO MACROMOLECULES
AB We investigate the self-assembly and aggregation behaviors of nanoparticles in hybrid assemblies made from amphiphilic block copolymer tethered nanoparticles using the dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)) approach. By varying the arm number of the tethered amphiphilic block copolymers, hydrophobic block chain length, and interaction parameter between nanoparticle and hydrophobic block, different morphelogical hybrid aggregates are obtained, including branching rod-like micelles, ring-like disk-like micelles, and vesicles. Most importantly, the nanoparticles aggregate in the various micelles and form nanowires, nanorings, and nanoclusters. Only using amphiphilic block copolymer tethered nanoparticles, hybrid vesicles induding patchy vesicles-and heterogeneous vesicles are obtained. Moreover, nanodusters with distinct-number of nanoparticles in hybrid disk-like micelles and vesicles are fabricated through controlling the interaction parameter between nanoparticle and hydrophobic block.

TI Multi-shape memory polymers achieved by the spatio-assembly of 3D
   printable thermoplastic building blocks
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Multi-shape memory polymers were prepared by the macroscale spatio-assembly of building blocks in this work. The building blocks were methyl acrylate-co-styrene (MA-co-St) copolymers, which have the St-block-(St-random-MA)-block-St tri-block chain sequence. This design ensures that their transition temperatures can be adjusted over a wide range by varying the composition of the middle block. The two St blocks at the chain ends can generate a crosslink network in the final device to achieve strong bonding force between building blocks and the shape memory capacity. Due to their thermoplastic properties, 3D printing was employed for the spatio-assembly to build devices. This method is capable of introducing many transition phases into one device and preparing complicated shapes via 3D printing. The device can perform a complex action via a series of shape changes. Besides, this method can avoid the difficult programing of a series of temporary shapes. The control of intermediate temporary shapes was realized via programing the shapes and locations of building blocks in the final device.

TI Why Do Markets Crash? Bitcoin Data Offers Unprecedented Insights
SO PLOS ONE
AB Crashes have fascinated and baffled many canny observers of financial markets. In the strict orthodoxy of the efficient market theory, crashes must be due to sudden changes of the fundamental valuation of assets. However, detailed empirical studies suggest that large price jumps cannot be explained by news and are the result of endogenous feedback loops. Although plausible, a clear-cut empirical evidence for such a scenario is still lacking. Here we show how crashes are conditioned by the market liquidity, for which we propose a new measure inspired by recent theories of market impact and based on readily available, public information. Our results open the possibility of a dynamical evaluation of liquidity risk and early warning signs of market instabilities, and could lead to a quantitative description of the mechanisms leading to market crashes.

AB Bitcoin exchanges function like banks, securely holding their customers' bitcoins on their behalf. Several exchanges have suffered catastrophic losses with customers permanently losing their savings. A proof of solvency demonstrates that the exchange controls sufficient reserves to settle each customer's account. We introduce Provisions, a privacy-preserving proof of solvency whereby an exchange does not have to disclose its Bitcoin addresses; total holdings or liabilities; or any information about its customers. We also propose an extension which prevents exchanges from colluding to cover for each other's losses. We have implemented Provisions and it offers practical computation times and proof sizes even for a large Bitcoin exchange with millions of customers.

TI Self-assembly of POSS-containing block copolymers: Fixing the
   hierarchical structure in networks
SO POLYMER
AB A series of P(MMA-co-GMA)-b-PMAPOSS block copolymers (BCPs) were synthesized by ATRP. The BCPs contain FOSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane) as a pendant unit on a particular polymer block chain. In selective solvents, the BCPs self-assemble to form ordered micellar-like structures. Spherical, cylindrical or vesicle-like morphologies were produced by tuning the BCP and mixed solvent compositions. Crosslinking of the BCP by the reaction of the glycidyl groups in the P(MMA-co-GMA) block of the micelle shell (GMA = glycidyl methacrylate) with a diamine results in a long-range structure ordering. The hexagonally packed cylindrical arrangement of the BCP networks was revealed by SAXS and TEM. The hierarchical, ordered structure of the FOSS-containing hybrids was fixed by crosslinking. In addition, transient physical gels were prepared from triblock copolymers with outer MAPOSS blocks, and their rheological behavior was investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the increasing popularity of Bitcoin, a digital decentralized currency and payment system, the number of malicious third parties attempting to steal bitcoins has grown substantially. Attackers have stolen bitcoins worth millions of dollars from victims by using malware to gain access to the private keys stored on the victims' computers or smart phones. In order to protect the Bitcoin private keys, we propose the use of a hardware token for the authorization of transactions. We created a proof-of-concept Bitcoin hardware token: BlueWallet. The device communicates using Bluetooth Low Energy and is able to securely sign Bitcoin transactions. The device can also be used as an electronic wallet in combination with a point of sale and serves as an alternative to cash and credit cards.

SE Lecture Notes in Computer Science
CT 11th Cryptographers Track - RSA Conference
CY FEB 14-18, 2011
CL San Francisco, CA
AB Client puzzles are meant to act as a defense against denial of service (DoS) attacks by requiring a client to solve some moderately hard problem before being granted access to a resource. However, recent client puzzle difficulty definitions (Stebila and Ustaoglu, 2009; Chen et al., 2009) do not ensure that solving n puzzles is n times harder than solving one puzzle. Motivated by examples of puzzles where this is the case, we present stronger definitions of difficulty for client puzzles that are meaningful in the context of adversaries with more computational power than required to solve a single puzzle.
   A protocol using strong client puzzles may still not be secure against DoS attacks if the puzzles are not used in a secure manlier. We describe a security model for analyzing the DoS resistance of any protocol in the context of client puzzles and give a generic technique for combining any protocol with a strong client puzzle to obtain a DoS-resistant protocol.

TI Herding behaviour in cryptocurrencies
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This study examines the presence of herding behaviour in the cryptocurrency market. The latter is the outcome of mass collaboration and imitation. Results from the static model suggest no significant herding. However, the presence of structural breaks and nonlinearities in the data series suggests applying a static model is not appropriate. Accordingly, we conduct a rolling-window analysis, and those results point to significant herding behaviour, which varies over time. Using a logistic regression, we find that herding tends to occur as uncertainty increases. Our findings induce useful insights related to portfolio and risk management, trading strategies, and market efficiency.

TI CrowdBC: A Blockchain-Based Decentralized Framework for Crowdsourcing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Crowdsourcing systems which utilize the human intelligence to solve complex tasks have gained considerable interest and adoption in recent years. However, the majority of existing crowdsourcing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to the weaknesses of traditional trust-based model, such as single point of failure. They are also vulnerable to distributed denial of service ( DDoS) and Sybil attacks due to malicious users involvement. In addition, high service fees from the crowdsourcing platform may hinder the development of crowdsourcing. How to address these potential issues has both research and substantial value. In this paper, we conceptualize a blockchain-based decentralized framework for crowdsourcing named CrowdBC, in which a requester's task can be solved by a crowd of workers without relying on any third trusted institution, users' privacy can be guaranteed and only low transaction fees are required. In particular, we introduce the architecture of our proposed framework, based on which we give a concrete scheme. We further implement a software prototype on Ethereum public test network with real-world dataset. Experiment results show the feasibility, usability, and scalability of our proposed crowdsourcing system.

TI Dynamic connectedness and integration in cryptocurrency markets
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB This study applies a set of measures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2016) to examine connectedness via return and volatility spillovers across six large cryptocurrencies from August 7, 2015 to February 22, 2018. Regardless of the sign of returns, the results show that Litecoin and Bitcoin are at the centre of the connected network of returns. This finding implies that return shocks arising from these two cryptocurrencies have the most effect on other cryptocurrencies. Further analysis shows that connectedness via negative returns is largely stronger than via positive ones. Ripple and Ethereum are the top recipients of negative-return shocks, whereas Ethereum and Dash exhibit very weak connectedness via positive returns. Regarding volatility spillovers, Bitcoin is the most influential, followed by Litecoin; Dash exhibits a very weak connectedness, suggesting its utility for hedging and diversification opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Taken together, results imply that the importance of each cryptocurrency in return and volatility connectedness is not necessarily related to its market size. Further analyses reveal that trading volume and global financial and uncertainty effects as well as the investment-substitution effect are determinants of net directional spillovers. Interestingly, higher gold prices and US uncertainty increase the net directional negative-return spillovers, whereas they do the opposite for net directional positive-return spillovers. Furthermore, gold prices exhibit a negative sign for net directional-volatility spillovers, whereas US uncertainty shows a positive sign. Economic actors interested in the cryptocurrency market can build on our findings when weighing their decisions.

TI Block4Forensic: An Integrated Lightweight Blockchain Framework for

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB systems that not only communicate with other vehicles but also gather various information from hundreds of sensors within them. These developments help create smart and connected (e.g., self-driving) vehicles that will introduce significant information to drivers, manufacturers, insurance companies, and maintenance service providers for various applications. One such application that is becoming crucial with the introduction of self-driving cars is forensic analysis of traffic accidents. The utilization of vehicle-related data can be instrumental in post-accident scenarios to discover the faulty party, particularly for self-driving vehicles. With the opportunity of being able to access various information in cars, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework among the various elements involved to manage the collected vehicle-related data. Specifically, we first integrate vehicular public key infrastructure (VPKI) to the proposed blockchain to provide membership establishment and privacy. Next, we design a fragmented ledger that will store detailed data related to vehicles such as maintenance information/history, car diagnosis reports, and so on. The proposed forensic framework enables trustless, traceable, and privacy-aware post-accident analysis with minimal storage and processing overhead.

TI Opportunities for Use of Blockchain Technology in Medicine
SO APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY
AB Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer computer network, which is secured through cryptography, and over time, its history gets locked in blocks of data that are cryptographically linked together and secured. So far, there have been use cases of this technology for cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, financial and public records, and property ownership. It is expected that future uses will expand into medicine, science, education, intellectual property, and supply chain management. Likely applications in the field of medicine could include electronic health records, health insurance, biomedical research, drug supply and procurement processes, and medical education. Utilization of blockchain is not without its weaknesses and currently, this technology is extremely immature and lacks public or even expert knowledge, making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true future potential. Presently, there are issues with scalability, security of smart contracts, and user adoption. Nevertheless, with capital investments into blockchain technology projected to reach US$400 million in 2019, health professionals and decision makers should be aware of the transformative potential that blockchain technology offers for healthcare organizations and medical practice.

SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The vast transactional, trust and security advantages of Bitcoin are dwarfed by the intentionally resource-intensive design in its transaction verification process which now threatens the climate we depend upon for survival. Indeed Bitcoin mining and transactions are an application of Blockchain technology employing an inefficient use of scarce energy resources for a financial activity at a point in human development where world governments are scrambling to reduce energy consumption through their Paris Agreement climate change commitments and beyond to mitigate future climate change implications.
   Without encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy consuming Blockchain technology designs.
   The research question explores how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain technologies. The article concludes by identifying appropriate fiscal policy options for this purpose, as well as further considerations on the potential for Blockchain technology in climate change mitigation.

We propose a novel indicator to assess informed trades ahead of cryptocurrency-related events. Using trade-level data of USD/BTC exchange rates, we find evidence of informed trading in the Bitcoin market prior to large events: Quantiles of the order sizes of buyer-initiated (seller-initiated) orders are abnormally high before large positive (negative) events, compared to the quantiles of seller-initiated (buyer-initiated) orders. When examining the timing of informed trades, we further notice that informed traders prefer to build their positions two days before large positive events and one day before large negative events. The profits of informed trading in the Bitcoin market are estimated to be considerably large.

TI MIStore: a Blockchain-Based Medical Insurance Storage System
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Currently, blockchain technology, which is decentralized and may provide tamper-resistance to recorded data, is experiencing exponential growth in industry and research. In this paper, we propose the MIStore, a blockchain-based medical insurance storage system. Due to blockchain's the property of tamper-resistance, MIStore may provide a high-credibility to users. In a basic instance of the system, there are a hospital, patient, insurance company and n servers. Specifically, the hospital performs a (t, n)-threshold MIStore protocol among the n servers. For the protocol, any node of the blockchain may join the protocol to be a server if the node and the hospital wish. Patient's spending data is stored by the hospital in the blockchain and is protected by the n servers. Any t servers may help the insurance company to obtain a sum of a part of the patient's spending data, which servers can perform homomorphic computations on. However, the n servers cannot learn anything from the patient's spending data, which recorded in the blockchain, forever as long as more than n - t servers are honest. Besides, because most of verifications are performed by record-nodes and all related data is stored at the blockchain, thus the insurance company, servers and the hospital only need small memory and CPU. Finally, we deploy the MIStore on the Ethererum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
AB A PubMed query run in June 2018 using the keyword 'blockchain' retrieved 40 indexed papers, a reflection of the growing interest in blockchain among the medical and healthcare research and practice communities. Blockchain's foundations of decentralisation, cryptographic security and immutability make it a strong contender in reshaping the healthcare landscape worldwide. Blockchain solutions are currently being explored for: (1) securing patient and provider identities; (2) managing pharmaceutical and medical device supply chains; (3) clinical research and data monetisation; (4) medical fraud detection; (5) public health surveillance; (6) enabling truly public and open geo-tagged data; (7) powering many Internet of Things-connected autonomous devices, wearables, drones and vehicles, via the distributed peer-to-peer apps they run, to deliver the full vision of smart healthy cities and regions; and (8) blockchain-enabled augmented reality in crisis mapping and recovery scenarios, including mechanisms for validating, crediting and rewarding crowdsourced geo-tagged data, among other emerging use cases. Geospatially-enabled blockchain solutions exist today that use a crypto-spatial coordinate system to add an immutable spatial context that regular blockchains lack. These geospatial blockchains do not just record an entry's specific time, but also require and validate its associated proof of location, allowing accurate spatiotemporal mapping of physical world events. Blockchain and distributed ledger technology face similar challenges as any other technology threatening to disintermediate legacy processes and commercial interests, namely the challenges of blockchain interoperability, security and privacy, as well as the need to find suitable and sustainable business models of implementation. Nevertheless, we expect blockchain technologies to get increasingly powerful and robust, as they become coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) in various real-word healthcare solutions involving AI-mediated data exchange on blockchains.

TI Secure and anonymous decentralized Bitcoin mixing
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The decentralized digital currency Bitcoin presents an anonymous alternative to the centralized banking system and indeed enjoys widespread and increasing adoption. Recent works, however, show how users can be reidentified and their payments linked based on Bitcoin's most central element, the blockchain, a public ledger of all transactions. Thus, many regard Bitcoin's central promise of financial privacy as broken.
   In this paper, we propose CoinParty, an efficient decentralized mixing service that allows users to reestablish their financial privacy in Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies. CoinParty, through a novel combination of decryption mixnets with threshold signatures, takes a unique place in the design space of mixing services, combining the advantages of previously proposed centralized and decentralized mixing services in one system. Our prototype implementation of CoinParty scales to large numbers of users and achieves anonymity sets by orders of magnitude higher than related work as we quantify by analyzing transactions in the actual Bitcoin blockchain. CoinParty can easily be deployed by any individual group of users, i.e., independent of any third parties, or provided as a commercial or voluntary service, e.g., as a community service by privacy-aware organizations.

AB Designing a secure permissionless distributed ledger (blockchain) that performs on par with centralized payment processors, such as Visa, is a challenging task. Most existing distributed ledgers are unable to scale-out, i.e., to grow their total processing capacity with the number of validators; and those that do, compromise security or decentralization. We present OmniLedger, a novel scale-out distributed ledger that preserves long-term security under permissionless operation. It ensures security and correctness by using a bias-resistant public-randomness protocol for choosing large, statistically representative shards that process transactions, and by introducing an efficient crossshard commit protocol that atomically handles transactions affecting multiple shards. OmniLedger also optimizes performance via parallel intra-shard transaction processing, ledger pruning via collectively-signed state blocks, and low-latency "trust-butverify" validation for low-value transactions. An evaluation of our experimental prototype shows that OmniLedger's throughput scales linearly in the number of active validators, supporting Visa-level workloads and beyond, while confirming typical transactions in under two seconds.

TI BIDaaS: Blockchain Based ID As a Service
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology has been known as the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies, but nowadays it is further considered as a functional technology for improving existing technologies and creating new applications previously never practical. In this paper, we are focused on utilizing blockchain technology to introduce a new ID as a service (IDaaS) for digital identity management. The proposed blockchain-based ID as a service (BIDaaS) is explained with one practical example that shows how the proposed BIDaaS works as an identity and authentication management infrastructure for mobile users of a mobile telecommunication company.

TI Virtualization for Distributed Ledger Technology (vDLT)
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recently, with the tremendous development of crypto-currencies, distributed ledger technology (DLT) (e.g., blockchain) has attracted significant attention. The traditional Internet was originally design to handle the exchange of information. With DLT, we will have the Internet of value. Although, DLT has a great potential to create new foundations for our economic and social systems, the existing DLT has a number of drawbacks (e.g., scalability) that prevent it from being used as a generic platform for distributed ledger across the globe. In this paper, we present a novel virtualization approach to address the challenges in the existing DLT systems. Specifically, in the proposed virtualization for DLT (vDLT), the underlying resources (e.g., hardware, compute, storage, network, and so on) are abstracted. By providing a logical view of resources, vDLT can significantly improve the performance, facilitate system evolution, and simplify DLT management and configuration. Several use cases of vDLT are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed vDLT.

TI Blockchain for good?
SO STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB The blockchain innovation appears to represent viable catalysts for achieving global sustainable development targets. Projects and initiatives seeking to extend the reach of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) seem mostly intended for the benefit of for-profit businesses, governments, and consumers. DLT projects devised for the public good could aim, in theory, to fulfill the United Nation's current sustainable development goals. Blockchain technology is being applied in ways that could transform this ambition for good into a practical reality.

AB With(1) the rapid growth of the internet of things (IoT) market and requirement, low power wide area (LPWA) technologies have become popular. In various LPWA technologies, Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT) and long range (LoRa) are two main leading competitive technologies. Comparing to NB-IoT network that mainly built and managed by mobile network operators, LoRa wide-area network (LoRaWAN) is mainly operated by private companies or organizations, which will bring the trust issues between application customers and network operations. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain technology based solution to build an open, trusted, decentralized and tamper-proof system for LoRaWAN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrating blockchain technology and LoRaWAN IoT technology.

AB The recent approval of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes new data protection requirements on data controllers and processors with respect to the processing of European Union (EU) residents' data. These requirements consist of a single set of rules that have binding legal status and should be enforced in all EU member states. In light of these requirements, we propose in this paper the use of a blockchain-based approach to support data accountability and provenance tracking. Our approach relies on the use of publicly auditable contracts deployed in a blockchain that increase the transparency with respect to the access and usage of data. We identify and discuss three models for our approach with different granularity and scalability requirements where contracts can be used to encode data usage policies and provenance tracking information in a privacy-friendly way. From these three models we designed, implemented, and evaluated a model where contracts are deployed by data subjects for each data controller, and a model where subjects join contracts deployed by data controllers in case they accept the data handling conditions. Our implementations show in practice the feasibility and limitations of contracts for the purposes identified in this paper.

TI Measuring personality functioning in older adults: construct validity of
   the Severity Indices of Personality Functioning - Short Form (SIPP-SF)
SO AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
AB Objective: The dimensional personality disorders model in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-5 section III conceptually differentiates impaired personality functioning (criterion A) from the presence of pathological traits (criterion B). This study is the first to specifically address the measurement of criterion A in older adults. Moreover, the convergent/divergent validity of criterion A and criterion B will be compared in younger and older age groups.Method: The Severity Indices of Personality Functioning - Short Form (SIPP-SF) was administered in older (N = 171) and younger adults (N = 210). The factorial structure was analyzed with exploratory structural equation modeling. Differences in convergent/divergent validity between personality functioning (SIPP-SF) and pathological traits (Personality Inventory for DSM-5; Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire) were examined across age groups.Results: Identity Integration, Relational Capacities, Responsibility, Self-Control, and Social Concordance were corroborated as higher order domains. Although the SIPP-SF domains measured unique variation, some high correlations with pathological traits referred to overlapping constructs. Moreover, in older adults, personality functioning was more strongly related to Psychoticism, Disinhibition, Antagonism and Dissocial Behavior compared to younger adults.Discussion: The SIPP-SF construct validity was demonstrated in terms of a structure of five higher order domains of personality functioning. The instrument is promising as a possible measure of impaired personality functioning in older adults. As such, it is a useful clinical tool to follow up effects of therapy on levels of personality functioning. Moreover, traits were associated with different degrees of personality functioning across age groups.

AB Current networking integrates common "Things" to the Web, creating the Internet of Things (IoT). The considerable number of heterogeneous Things that can be part of an IoT network demands an efficient management of resources. With the advent of Fog computing, some IoT management tasks can be distributed toward the edge of the constrained networks, closer to physical devices. Blockchain protocols hosted on Fog networks can handle IoT management tasks such as communication, storage, and authentication. This research goes beyond the current definition of Things and presents the Internet of "Smart Things." Smart Things are provisioned with Artificial Intelligence (AI) features based on CLIPS programming language to become self-inferenceable and self-monitorable. This work uses the permission-based blockchain protocol Multichain to communicate many Smart Things by reading and writing blocks of information. This paper evaluates Smart Things deployed on Edison Arduino boards. Also, this work evaluates Multichain hosted on a Fog network.

AB The development of robotics, the Internet of Things concept, big data processing techniques, automation, and distributed digital ledgers leads to the fourth industrial revolution. One of the main issues of new industry is interaction between the "smart factory" components both internally and with other factories based on the Internet of Things. This interaction should provide trust between the participants of the Internet of Things; control over the distribution of resources (such as maintenance time, energy, etc.) and finished products. The paper describes one of the possible ways of integrating Internet of Things and blockchain technologies to solve these issues. For this purpose, an architecture has been developed that combines Smart-M3 information sharing platform and blockchain platform. One of the main features of the proposed architecture is the use of smart contracts for processing and storing information related to the interaction between smart space components.

AB Blockchain is a novel way to construct fully distributed systems and has the potential to disrupt many businesses including Uber and Airbnb within the sharing economy. Specifically, blockchain provides a method to enforce the agreement between a user and the physical property owner without using any trusted party, e.g., if a user pays the agreed money, the blockchain guarantees that he/she has access to the property. While a blockchain based system has many desirable features, it may leak privacy information of involved parties due to its openness to the public. To mitigate the privacy concern, we propose a privacy respecting approach for blockchain-based sharing economy applications, which leverages a zero-knowledge scheme. We also analyze the security features and performance of the proposed approach to demonstrate its effectiveness in these applications.

TI Apple peel polyphenols: a key player in the prevention and treatment of
   experimental inflammatory bowel disease
SO CLINICAL SCIENCE
AB Diets rich in fruits and vegetables may reduce oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation via several mechanisms. These beneficial effects may be due to their high polyphenol content. The aims of the present study are to evaluate the preventive and therapeutic aspects of polyphenols in dried apple peel powder (DAPP) on intestinal inflammation while elucidating the underlying mechanisms and clinical benefits. Induction of intestinal inflammation in mice was performed by oral administration of the inflammatory agent dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) at 2.5% for 10 days. Physiological and supraphysiological doses of DAPP (200 and 400 mg/kg/day respectively) were administered by gavage for 10 days pre- and post-DSS treatment. DSS-mediated inflammation caused weight loss, shortening of the colon, dystrophic detachment of the epithelium, and infiltration of mono-and poly-morphonuclear cells in the colon. DSS induced an increase in lipid peroxidation, a down-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, an augmented expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an elevated production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and a shift in mucosa-associated microbial composition. However, DAPP normalized most of these abnormalities in preventive or therapeutic situations in addition to lowering inflammatory cytokines while stimulating antioxidant transcription factors and modulating other potential healing pathways. The supraphysiological dose of DAPP in therapeutic situations also improved mitochondrial dysfunction. Relative abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Enterobacteriaceae bacteria was slightly decreased in DAPP-treated mice. In conclusion, DAPP exhibits powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action in the intestine and is associated with the regulation of cellular signalling pathways and changes in microbiota composition. Evaluation of preventive and therapeutic effects of DAPP may be clinically feasible in individuals with intestinal inflammatory bowel diseases.

AB The Bitcoin cryptocurrency introduced a novel distributed consensus mechanism relying on economic incentives. While a coalition controlling a majority of computational power may undermine the system, for example by double-spending funds, it is often assumed it would be incentivized not to attack to protect its long-term stake in the health of the currency. We show how an attacker might purchase mining power (perhaps at a cost premium) for a short duration via bribery. Indeed, bribery can even be performed in-bandwith the system itself enforcing the bribe. A bribing attacker would not have the same concerns about the long-term health of the system, as their majority control is inherently short-lived. New modeling assumptions are needed to explain why such attacks have not been observed in practice. The need for all miners to avoid short-term profits by accepting bribes further suggests a potential tragedy of the commons which has not yet been analyzed.

AB Most popular blockchain solutions rely on proof-of-work to guarantee that participants reach consensus on a unique block per index of the chain. As consensus is impossible in the general case, it seems that these blockchain systems require messages are delivered fast and no participant mines faster than the crowd. To date, no experimental settings have however been proposed to demonstrate this hypothesis.
   In this paper, we identify conditions under which these blockchain systems fail to ensure consensus and present a reproducible execution on our Ethereum private chain. To this end, we introduce the Blockchain Anomaly, the impossibility for the blockchain to guarantee that a committed transaction is not abortable. This anomaly may translate into dramatic consequences for the user of proof-of-work blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like "Bob sends money to Carole after he received money from Alice" impossible and may lead to double spending. We also explain how the anomaly differs from a 51-percent attack and how one could avoid it by adapting the Ethereum implementation or by exploiting smart contracts.

TI Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification for Laboratory Confirmation of
   Buruli Ulcer Disease-Towards a Point-of-Care Test
SO PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB Background
   As the major burden of Buruli ulcer disease (BUD) occurs in remote rural areas, development of point-of-care (POC) tests is considered a research priority to bring diagnostic services closer to the patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a simple, robust and cost-effective technology, has been selected as a promising POC test candidate. Three BUD-specific LAMP assays are available to date, but various technical challenges still hamper decentralized application. To overcome the requirement of cold-chains for transport and storage of reagents, the aim of this study was to establish a dry-reagent-based LAMP assay (DRB-LAMP) employing lyophilized reagents.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Following the design of an IS2404 based conventional LAMP (cLAMP) assay suitable to apply lyophilized reagents, a lyophylization protocol for the DRB-LAMP format was developed. Clinical performance of cLAMP was validated through testing of 140 clinical samples from 91 suspected BUD cases by routine assays, i.e. IS2404 dry-reagent-based (DRB) PCR, conventional IS2404 PCR (cPCR), IS2404 qPCR, compared to cLAMP. Whereas qPCR rendered an additional 10% of confirmed cases and samples respectively, case confirmation and positivity rates of DRB-PCR or cPCR (64.84% and 56.43%; 100% concordant results in both assays) and cLAMP (62.64% and 52.86%) were comparable and there was no significant difference between the sensitivity of the assays (DRB PCR and cPCR, 86.76%; cLAMP, 83.82%). Likewise, sensitivity of cLAMP (95.83%) and DRB-LAMP (91.67%) were comparable as determined on a set of 24 samples tested positive in all routine assays.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Both LAMP formats constitute equivalent alternatives to conventional PCR techniques. Provided the envisaged availability of field friendly DNA extraction formats, both assays are suitable for decentralized laboratory confirmation of BUD, whereby DRB-LAMP scores with the additional advantage of not requiring cold-chains. As validation of the assays was conducted in a third-level laboratory environment, field based evaluation trials are necessary to determine the clinical performance at peripheral health care level.

AB We study the problem of malleability of Bitcoin transactions. Our first two contributions can be summarized as follows:
   (i) we perform practical experiments on Bitcoin that show that it is very easy to maul Bitcoin transactions with high probability, and
   (ii) we analyze the behavior of the popular Bitcoin wallets in the situation when their transactions are mauled; we conclude that most of them are to some extend not able to handle this situation correctly.
   The contributions in points (i) and (ii) are experimental. We also address a more theoretical problem of protecting the Bitcoin distributed contracts against the "malleability" attacks. It is well-known that malleability can pose serious problems in some of those contracts. It concerns mostly the protocols which use a "refund" transaction to withdraw a financial deposit in case the other party interrupts the protocol. Our third contribution is as follows:
   (iii) we show a general method for dealing with the transaction malleability in Bitcoin contracts. In short: this is achieved by creating a malleability-resilient "refund" transaction which does not require any modification of the Bitcoin protocol.

AB We construct a 3-move public coin special honest verifier zero-knowledge proof, a so-called Sigma-protocol, for a list of commitments having at least one commitment that opens to 0. It is not required for the prover to know openings of the other commitments. The proof system is efficient, in particular in terms of communication requiring only the transmission of a logarithmic number of commitments.
   We use our proof system to instantiate both ring signatures and zerocoin, a novel mechanism for bitcoin privacy. We use our Sigma-protocol as a (linkable) ad-hoc group identification scheme where the users have public keys that are commitments and demonstrate knowledge of an opening for one of the commitments to unlinkably identify themselves (once) as belonging to the group. Applying the Fiat-Shamir transform on the group identification scheme gives rise to ring signatures, applying it to the linkable group identification scheme gives rise to zerocoin.
   Our ring signatures are very small compared to other ring signature schemes and we only assume the users' secret keys to be the discrete logarithms of single group elements so the setup is quite realistic. Similarly, compared with the original zerocoin protocol we only rely on a weak cryptographic assumption and do not require a trusted setup.
   A third application of our Sigma protocol is an efficient proof of membership of a secret committed value belonging to a public list of values.

AB Back and Bentov (arXiv 2014) and Andrychowicz et al. (Security and Privacy 2014) introduced techniques to perform secure multiparty computations on Bitcoin. Among other things, these works constructed lottery protocols that ensure that any party that aborts after learning the outcome pays a monetary penalty to all other parties. Following this, Andrychowicz et al. (Bitcoin Workshop 2014) and concurrently Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014) extended the solution to arbitrary secure function evaluation while guaranteeing fairness in the following sense: any party that aborts after learning the output pays a monetary penalty to all parties that did not learn the output. Andrychowicz et al. (Bitcoin Workshop 2014) also suggested extending to scenarios where parties receive a payoff according to the output of a secure function evaluation, and outlined a 2-party protocol for the same that in addition satisfies the notion of fairness described above.
   In this work, we formalize, generalize, and construct multiparty protocols for the primitive suggested by Andrychowicz et al. We call this primitive secure cash distribution with penalties. Our formulation of secure cash distribution with penalties poses it as a multistage reactive functionality (i.e., more general than secure function evaluation) that provides a way to securely implement smart contracts in a decentralized setting, and consequently suffices to capture a wide variety of stateful computations involving data and/or money, such as decentralized auctions, markets, and games such as poker, etc. Our protocol realizing secure cash distribution with penalties works in a hybrid model where parties have access to a claim-or-refund transaction functionality F-CR(star) which can be efficiently realized in (a variant of) Bitcoin, and is otherwise independent of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We emphasize that our protocol is dropout-tolerant in the sense that any party that drops out during the protocol is forced to pay a monetary penalty to all other parties. Our formalization and construction generalize both secure computation with penalties of Bentov and Kumaresan (Crypto 2014), and secure lottery with penalties of Andrychowicz et al. (Security and Privacy 2014).

AB In this paper, we propose a new concept for understanding the role of algorithms in daily life: algorithmic authority. Algorithmic authority is the legitimate power of algorithms to direct human action and to impact which information is considered true. We use this concept to examine the culture of users of Bitcoin, a crypto-currency and payment platform. Through Bitcoin, we explore what it means to trust in algorithms. Our study utilizes interview and survey data. We found that Bitcoin users prefer algorithmic authority to the authority of conventional institutions, which they see as untrustworthy. However, we argue that Bitcoin users do not have blind faith in algorithms; rather, they acknowledge the need for mediating algorithmic authority with human judgment. We examine the tension between members of the Bitcoin community who would prefer to integrate Bitcoin with existing institutions and those who would prefer to resist integration.

AB In recent years, Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer network based crypto digital currency, has attracted a lot of attentions from the media, the academia, and the general public. A user in Bitcoin network can create Bitcoins by packing and verifying new transactions in the network using their computation power. Driven by the price surge of Bitcoin, users are increasingly investing on expensive specialized hardware for Bitcoin mining. To obtain steady payouts, users also pool their computation resources to conduct pool mining. In this paper, we study the evolution of Bitcoin miners by analyzing the complete transaction blockchain. We characterize how the productivity, computation power and transaction activity of miners evolve over time. We also conduct an in-depth study on the largest mining pool F2Pool. We show how it grows over time and how computation power is distributed among its miners. Finally, we build a simple economic model to explain the evolution of Bitcoin miners.

TI A general noise-reduction framework for fault localization of Java
   programs
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Existing fault-localization techniques combine various program features and similarity coefficients with the aim of precisely assessing the similarities among the dynamic spectra of these program features to predict the locations of faults. Many such techniques estimate the probability of a particular program feature causing the observed failures. They often ignore the noise introduced by other features on the same set of executions that may lead to the observed failures. It is unclear to what extent such noise can be alleviated.
   Objective: This paper aims to develop a framework that reduces the noise in fault-failure correlation measurements.
   Method: We develop a fault-localization framework that uses chains of key basic blocks as program features and a noise-reduction methodology to improve on the similarity coefficients of fault-localization techniques. We evaluate our framework on five base techniques using five real-life median-scaled programs in different application domains. We also conduct a case study on subjects with multiple faults.
   Results: The experimental result shows that the synthesized techniques are more effective than their base techniques by almost 10%. Moreover, their runtime overhead factors to collect the required feature values are practical. The case study also shows that the synthesized techniques work well on subjects with multiple faults.
   Conclusion: We conclude that the proposed framework has a significant and positive effect on improving the effectiveness of the corresponding base techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Co-explosivity in the cryptocurrency market
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Most of the limited evidence on the exponential price spikes (i.e. price explosivity) in the cryptocurrency market mainly considers the case of Bitcoin, although other cryptocurrencies have gradually eroded Bitcoin's dominance. Importantly, none has been documented as to whether explosivity periods in cryptocurrencies are contemporaneously related. Accordingly, we date-stamp price explosivity in leading cryptocurrencies and reveal that all cryptocurrencies investigated herein were characterised by multiple explosivity. Then, we determine whether explosivity in one cryptocurrency can lead to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies. Results show evidence of a multidirectional co-explosivity behaviour that is not necessarily from bigger to smaller and younger markets.

In addition, we provide a taxonomy and a side-by-side comparison of the state-of-the-art methods toward secure and privacy-preserving blockchain technologies with respect to the blockchain model, specific security goals, performance, limitations, computation complexity, and communication overhead. Based on the current survey, we highlight open research challenges and discuss possible future research directions in the blockchain technologies for IoT.

The aim is to investigate the current state of blockchain technology and its applications in several specific characteristics of this disruptive technology can revolutionise "business-as-usual" practices. To this end, the theoretical underpinnings of numerous research papers published in high ranked scientific journals during the last decade, along with several reports from grey literature as a means of streamlining our assessment and capturing the continuously expanding blockchain domain, are included in this review. Based on a structured, systematic review and thematic content analysis of the discovered literature, we present a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications across diverse sectors such as supply chain, business, healthcare, IoT, privacy, and data management, and we establish key themes, trends and emerging areas for research. We also point to the shortcomings identified in the relevant literature, particularly limitations the blockchain technology presents and how these limitations spawn across different sectors and industries. Building on these findings, we identify various research gaps and future exploratory directions that are anticipated to be of significant value both for academics and practitioners.

TI Blockchain-Based Medical Records Secure Storage and Medical Service

AB Accurate and complete medical data are one valuable asset for patients. Privacy protection and the secure storage of medical data are crucial issues during medical services. Secure storage and making full use of personal medical records has always been a concern for the general population. The emergence of blockchain technology brings a new idea to solve this problem. As a hash chain with the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability and immutability, blockchain technology can be used to securely store personal medical data. In this paper, we design a storage scheme to manage personal medical data based on blockchain and cloud storage. Furthermore, a service framework for sharing medical records is described. In addition, the characteristics of the medical blockchain are presented and analyzed through a comparison with traditional systems. The proposed storage and sharing scheme does not depend on any third-party and no single party has absolute power to affect the processing.

Blockchain, a decentralized database based on cryptographic techniques, is promising for IoT security, which may influence a variety of areas including manufacture, finance, and trading. The blockchain framework in an IoT system is an intriguing alternative to the traditional centralized model, which is struggling to meet some specified demands in IoT. In this article, we investigate typical security and privacy issues in IoT and develop a framework to integrate blockchain with IoT, which can provide great assurance for IoT data and various functionalities and desirable scalability including authentication, decentralized payment, and so on. We also suggest some possible solutions to these security and privacy issues in IoT based on blockchain and Ethereum to show how blockchain contributes to IoT.

We analyze the determinants of the success of these token offerings by considering a sample of 253 campaigns. We find that the probability of an ICO's success is higher if the code source is available, when a token presale is organized, and when tokens allow contributors to access a specific service (or to share profits). Our results provide valuable insights into this new source of capital for businesses and into the key determinants of fundraising success.

SO NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
AB There are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies in existence and the technological backbone of many of these currencies is blockchain-a digital ledger of transactions. The competitive process of adding blocks to the chain is computation-intensive and requires large energy input. Here we demonstrate a methodology for calculating the minimum power requirements of several cryptocurrency networks and the energy consumed to produce one US dollar's (US$) worth of digital assets. From 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, we estimate that mining Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero consumed an average of 17, 7, 7 and 14 MJ to generate one US$, respectively. Comparatively, conventional mining of aluminium, copper, gold, platinum and rare earth oxides consumed 122, 4, 5, 7 and 9 MJ to generate one US$, respectively, indicating that (with the exception of aluminium) cryptomining consumed more energy than mineral mining to produce an equivalent market value. While the market prices of the coins are quite volatile, the network hashrates for three of the four cryptocurrencies have trended consistently upward, suggesting that energy requirements will continue to increase. During this period, we estimate mining for all 4 cryptocurrencies was responsible for 3-15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.

TI Evolutionary Game for Mining Pool Selection in Blockchain Networks
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB In proof-of-work-based blockchain networks, the block miners participate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition to win the reward of publishing (i.e., mining) new blocks. Due to the remarkable difficulty of the crypto-puzzle, individual miners tend to join mining pools to secure stable profits. We study the dynamics of mining pool selection in a blockchain network, where mining pools may choose arbitrary block mining strategies. We identify the hash rate for puzzle-solving and the block propagation delay as two major factors determining the mining competition results. We then model the strategy evolution of individual miners as an evolutionary game. We provide the theoretical analysis of evolutionary stability in the pool selection dynamics for a two-pool case. Numerical simulations support our theoretical findings as well as demonstrate the stability in the evolution of miners' strategies in a general case.

TI Bitcoin and global financial stress: A copula-based approach to

SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB We apply different techniques and uncover the quantile conditional dependence between the global financial stress index and Bitcoin returns from July 18, 2010, to December 29, 2017. The results from the copula-based dependence show evidence of right-tail dependence between the global financial stress index and Bitcoin returns. We focus on the conditional quantile dependence and indicate that the global financial stress index strongly Granger-causes Bitcoin returns at the left and right tail of the distribution of the Bitcoin returns, conditional on the global financial stress index. Finally, we use a bivariate cross-quantilogram approach and show only limited directional predictability from the global financial stress index to Bitcoin returns in the medium term, for which Bitcoin can act as a safe-haven against global financial stress.

TI BMPLS: Blockchain-Based Multi-level Privacy-Preserving Location Sharing
   Scheme for Telecare Medical Information Systems
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB The sharing of patients' locations is an important part in mobile medical services and modern smart healthcare. Although location sharing based on blockchains has advantages on decentralization and openness, there is also a challenge to guarantee the security and the privacy of locations recorded in a blockchain. To this end, this paper investigates the location sharing based on blockchains for telecare medical information systems. Firstly, we define the basic requirements of blockchain-based location sharing including decentralization, unforgeability, confidentiality, multi-level privacy protection, retrievability and verifiability. Then, using order-preserving encryption and merkle tree, we propose a blockchain-based multi-level location sharing scheme, i.e. BMPLS. The analysis results show that our scheme satisfies the above requirements. Finally, the performance of our scheme is evaluated and the experiment results show that our scheme is efficient and feasible for both patients and medical workers. In a word, our scheme can be applied to realize privacy-preserving location sharing based on blockchains for telecare medical information systems.

TI Social Payments: Innovation, Trust, Bitcoin, and the Sharing Economy
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB The payments industry - the business of transferring value through public and corporate infrastructures - is undergoing rapid transformation. New business models and regulatory environments disrupt more traditional fee-based strategies, and new entrants seek to displace legacy players by leveraging new mobile platforms and new sources of data. In this increasingly diversified industry landscape, start-ups and established players are attempting to embed payment in 'social' experience through novel technologies of accounting for trust. This imagination of the social, however, is being materialized in gated platforms for payment, accounting, and exchange. This paper explores the ambiguous politics of such experiments, specifically those, like Bitcoin or the on-demand sharing economy, that delineate an economic imaginary of 'just us' - a closed and closely guarded community of peers operating under the illusion that there are no mediating institutions undergirding that community. This provokes questions about the intersection of payment and publics. Payment innovators' attenuated understanding of the social may, we suggest, evacuate the nitty-gritty of politics.

TI Does Bitcoin exhibit the same asymmetric multifractal cross-correlations
   with crude oil, gold and DJIA as the Euro, Great British Pound and Yen?
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB We applied MF-ADCCA to analyze the presence and asymmetry of the cross-correlations between the major currency rates and Bitcoin, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), gold price and the oil crude market. We find that multifractality exists in every cross-correlation studied, and there is asymmetry in the cross-correlation exponents under different trend of the WTI, Gold and DJIA. Bitcoin shows a greater multifractal spectra than the other currencies on its cross-correlation with the WTI, the Gold and the DJIA. Bitcoin shows a clearly different relationship with commodities and stock market indices which has to be taken into consideration when investing. This has to do with the years this currency has been traded, the characteristics of cryptocurrencies and its gradual adoption by financial organizations, governments and the general public.

TI Digital enablement of blockchain: Evidence from HNA group
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Blockchain, the distributed ledger underlying bitcoin, has attracted much attention and stimulated rich discussions. However, extant discussions are mostly conceptual expositions, and empirical evidence of how to use the technology is limited. This case analysis fills this gap by conducting a study on Hainan Airlines (HNA) group, a large conglomerate, which has successfully implemented a blockchain-enabled E-commerce platform to offer employees flexible benefits. The case study unveils that blockchain of value in three ways: 1) issuing crypto-currency, 2) protecting sensitive information, and 3) eliminating institutional intermediaries. These findings provide a reference point for IT and general managers who intend to use blockchain to digitally enable their organizations further.

TI Price dynamics and speculative trading in Bitcoin
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB Few innovations in the money markets have brought more attention by regulators and policy makers than the digital currency Bitcoin. However, few studies in the literature have examined the price dynamics of Bitcoin. Besides providing an exploratory glace at the value and volatility of the Bitcoin across time, we also test whether the unusual level of Bitcoin's volatility is attributable to speculative trading. Results in this study do not find that, during 2013, speculative trading contributed to the unprecedented rise and subsequent crash in Bitcoin's value nor do we find that speculative trading is directly associated with Bitcoin's unusual level of volatility.

TI Authenticating Health Activity Data Using Distributed Ledger
   Technologies
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB The on-demand digital healthcare ecosystem is on the near horizon. It has the potential to extract a wealth of information from "big data" collected at the population level, to enhance preventive and precision medicine at the patient level. This may improve efficiency and quality while decreasing cost of healthcare delivered by professionals. However, there are still security and privacy issues that need to be addressed before algorithms, data, and models can be mobilized safely at scale. In this paper we discuss how distributed ledger technologies can play a key role in advancing electronic health, by ensuring authenticity and integrity of data generated by wearable and embedded devices. We demonstrate how the Masked Authenticated Messaging extension module of the IOTA protocol can be used to securely share, store, and retrieve encrypted activity data using a tamper-proof distributed ledger.

TI A Secure Cryptocurrency Scheme Based on Post-Quantum Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Nowadays, blockchain has become one of the most cutting-edge technologies, which has been widely concerned and researched. However, the quantum computing attack seriously threatens the security of blockchain, and related research is still less. Targeting at this issue, in this paper, we present the definition of post-quantum blockchain (PQB) and propose a secure cryptocurrency scheme based on PQB, which can resist quantum computing attacks. First, we propose a signature scheme based on lattice problem. We use lattice basis delegation algorithm to generate secret keys with selecting a random value, and sign message by preimage sampling algorithm. In addition, we design the first-signature and last-signature in our scheme, which are defined as double-signature. It is used to reduce the correlation between the message and the signature. Second, by combining the proposed signature scheme with blockchain, we construct the PQB and propose this cryptocurrency scheme. Its security can be reduced to the lattice short integer solution (SIS) problem. At last, through our analysis, the proposed cryptocurrency scheme is able to resist the quantum computing attack and its signature satisfies correctness and one-more unforgeability under the lattice SIS assumption. Furthermore, compared with previous signature schemes, the sizes of signature and secret keys are relatively shorter than that of others, which can decrease the computational complexity. These make our cryptocurrency scheme more secure and efficient.

TI Asymmetric Effects on Risks of Virtual Financial Assets (VFAs) in
   different regimes: A Case of Bitcoin
SO QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB The rapid development of VFAs allows investors to diversify their choices of investment products. In this paper, we measure the return risk of VFAs based on GARCH-type model. By establishing a Markov regime-switching Regression (MSR) Model, we explore the asymmetric effects of speculation, investor attention, and market interoperability on return risks in different risk regimes of VFAs. The results show that the influences of speculation and investor attention on the risks of VFAs are significantly positive at all regimes, while market interoperability only admits a positive impact on risk under high risk regime. All of the three factors exert asymmetric effects on risks in different regimes. Further study presents that the risk regime-switching also shows asymmetric characteristic but the medium risk regime is more stable than any others. Therefore, transactions of investors and arbitrageurs are monitored by certain policies, such as limiting the number of transactions or restricting the trading amount at high risk regime. However, when return risk is low, it will return to a medium level if we encourage investors to access.

TI How blockchain technology can change medicine
SO POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE
AB Although the best-known use of blockchain technology (BCT) is in the field of economics and cryptocurrencies in general, its usefulness is extending to other fields, including the biomedical field. The purpose of this article is to clarify the role that BCT can play in the field of medicine. We have performed a narrative review of the literature on BCT in general and on medicine in particular. The great advantage of BCT in the health arena is that it allows development of a stable and secure data set with which users can interact through transactions of various types. This environment allows the entry and operation of clinical data without compromising other sensitive data. Another important advantage of BCT is that the entire network is decentralized and is maintained by the users themselves; thus, there is no need to rely on organizations for storage. The Blockchain code is open source and can be used, modified and revised by its users. BCT literature is scarce so far. This article describes the basics of this technology and summarizes the various aspects in which BCT could change the paradigm of current medicine. The great potential of BCT, as well as its many applications in the field of health sciences, encompasses the fields of legal medicine, research, electronic medical records, medical data analysis (big data), teaching and the regulation of payment for medical services. If technological advances continue along these lines, it could bring about a revolution in medicine as we know it.

AB While the rapid development of IoT devices is changing our daily lives, some particular issues hinder the massive deployment of IoT devices. For example, current network ID management system cannot handle so many new terminals; there is no agreed security standards for IoT manufacturers to follow when designing their products. The whole IoT industry is expecting the breakthrough in network infrastructure and the development of novel security mechanisms that can enable the flexible, secure and reliable access and management of IoT devices. Bitcoin, first released in 2009, breeds the decentralized Blockchain technology. The decentralization, anonymity and proof of security characteristics of Blockchain can prevent collusion and single point failure of a centralized server. We believe that the application of Blockchain into the IoT system can clear the obstacles facing the development of IoT architecture and security. To this end, we propose an out-of-band two-factor authentication scheme for IoT devices based on Blockchain infrastructure. We implemented the IoT and Blockchain integrated system with Eris Blockchain and equivalent computing devices to emulate IoT devices. The overheads to run Blockchain and smart contract services on the emulator devices are measured. The BeagleBone Black and Raspberry Pi 3 nodes have an average memory usage of 29.5M, and the CPU usage of 29.55% and 13.35%, respectively.

AB With the development of the Internet of Things, a complex CPS system has emerged and is becoming a promising information infrastructure. In the CPS system, the loss of control over user data has become a very serious challenge, making it difficult to protect privacy, boost innovation, and guarantee data sovereignty. In this article, we propose HyperNet, a novel decentralized trusted computing and networking paradigm, to meet the challenge of loss of control over data. HyperNet is composed of the intelligent PDC, which is considered as the digital clone of a human individual; the decentralized trusted connection between any entities based on blockchain as well as smart contract; and the UDI platform, enabling secure digital object management and an identifier-driven routing mechanism. HyperNet has the capability of protecting data sovereignty, and has the potential to transform the current communication-based information system to the future data-oriented information society.

We outline and provide examples for at least four important ways in which this potential disruption of traditional global health funding mechanisms could occur: universal access to financing through direct transactions without third parties; novel new multilateral financing mechanisms; increased security and reduced fraud and corruption; and the opportunity for open markets for healthcare data that drive discovery and innovation. We see these issues as a paramount to the delivery of healthcare worldwide and relevant for payers and providers of healthcare at state, national and global levels; for government and non-governmental organisations; and for global aid organisations, including the WHO, International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group.

TI Blockchain entrepreneurship opportunity in the practices of the unbanked
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB Two billion people in developing economies have limited or no access to formal financial services, creating cause for substantial research interest in financial inclusion as a complex multidimensional phenomenon. Digital finance technologies, including blockchain, have empowered a type of crescive entrepreneurship that seeks opportunities in relation to financially excluded individuals. This article hypothesizes that nonmonetary causal factors and informal financial practices play a major role in habits of the financially excluded, which would favor blockchain's disintermediation features over the incumbent approach. After applying fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to determine the conditions related to financial practice and motivations that explain the absence of a formal bank account, I prescribe five sensitivities that blockchain entrepreneurs need to consider when targeting this segment. The value of this article's approach extends well beyond traditional unisystemic views for financial inclusion, as blockchain-based entrepreneurial opportunities emerge to reveal alternative forms of disintermediated financial services, which we exemplify in startups modeling informal practices. Blockchain entrepreneurship can generate semi-formal financial services that bring financial aspirations closer to people. My perspective is relevant to blockchain entrepreneurs who aim to understand the practices of the unbanked as source information for the development of innovative solutions.

In this paper, blockchain technology is introduced to address such a security problem of communications between different types of machines in the CPS. According to the principles of blockchain technology, we designed a blockchain for secure M2M communications. As a communication system, M2M consists of public network areas, device areas, and private areas, and we designed a sophisticated blockchain structure between the public area and private area. For validating our design, we took cotton spinning production as a case study to demonstrate our solution to M2M communication problems under the CPS framework. We have demonstrated that the blockchain technology can effectively solve the safety of expansion of machines in the production process and the communication data between the machines cannot be tampered with.

Femtoseconds Z-scan from 600 nm to 1030 nm showed positive third-order nonlinear refractive index with high linear transmission (>90%). Both compounds had >= 2.5 figure of merit (F) at 1030 nm, while DAPP-2 held >1 F value in a wide spectral region. Mechanism of ultrafast refraction under off & on-resonant regime were investigated via degenerate & non-degenerate pump-probe with phase object, respectively. Results indicate pure response of bound electrons under off-resonance and excited-state enhanced nonlinear refraction under on-resonance. All the study suggested that optical nonlinearity in pyrene derivatives has been underestimated and molecules like DAPP-2 possess the potential to be further optimized into superior broadband nonlinear refractive materials.

SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTERACTION AND COORDINATION
AB This paper presents an agent-based artificial cryptocurrency market in which heterogeneous agents buy or sell cryptocurrencies, in particular Bitcoins. In this market, there are two typologies of agents, Random Traders and Chartists, which interact with each other by trading Bitcoins. Each agent is initially endowed with a finite amount of crypto and/or fiat cash and issues buy and sell orders, according to her strategy and resources. The number of Bitcoins increases over time with a rate proportional to the real one, even if the mining process is not explicitly modelled. The model proposed is able to reproduce some of the real statistical properties of the price returns observed in the Bitcoin real market. In particular, it is able to reproduce the unit root property, the fat tail phenomenon and the volatility clustering. The simulator has been implemented using object-oriented technology, and could be considered a valid starting point to study and analyse the cryptocurrency market and its future evolutions.

SO PLOS ONE
AB Bitcoin is an online currency that is used worldwide to make online payments. It has consequently become an investment vehicle in itself and is traded in a way similar to other open currencies. The ability to predict the price fluctuation of Bitcoin would therefore facilitate future investment and payment decisions. In order to predict the price fluctuation of Bitcoin, we analyse the comments posted in the Bitcoin online forum. Unlike most research on Bitcoin- related online forums, which is limited to simple sentiment analysis and does not pay sufficient attention to note-worthy user comments, our approach involved extracting keywords from Bitcoin-related user comments posted on the online forum with the aim of analytically predicting the price and extent of transaction fluctuation of the currency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on Bitcoin online forum data ranging over a period of 2.8 years from December 2013 to September 2016.

TI Bitcoin and Potosi Silver Historical Perspectives on Cryptocurrency
SO TECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE
AB Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency, has been celebrated as the future of money on the Internet. Although Bitcoin does present several forward-looking innovations, it also integrates a very, old concept into its digital architecture: the mining of precious metals. Even though Bitcoin explicitly invokes mining as a metaphor and gold as an example for understanding the cryptocurrency, there has been little critical work on the connections between Bitcoin and previous metalist currency regimes. The following essay proposes a historical comparison with colonial South American silver mining and the global currency regime based on the New World silver peso it created as a way to interrogate Bitcoin. The comparison with colonial South America, and specifically the silver mining economy around the Cerro Rico de Potosi, will help to develop a historical and political understanding of Bit coin's stakes, including questions of resources, labor, energy, and ecology. Mining and the extractive apparatus that accompanies it always imply massive-scale earthworks that reshape the planet itself, a process known as terraforming. The Potosi comparison will reveal Bitcoin to form part of a similar process of digital primitive accumulation we can provisionally name cryptoforming.

AB In recent years, data is becoming the most valuable asset. There are more and more data exchange markets on Internet. These markets help data owners publish their datasets and data consumers find appropriate services. However, different from traditional goods like clothes and food, data is a special commodity. For current data exchange markets, it is very hard to protect copyright and privacy. Moreover, maintaining data services requires special IT techniques, which is a difficult job for many organizations who own big datasets, such as hospitals, government departments, planetariums and banks. In this paper, we propose a decentralized solution for big data exchange. This solution aims at cultivating an ecosystem, inside which all participators can cooperate to exchange data in a peer-to-peer way. The core part of this solution is to utilize blockchain technology to record transaction logs and other important documents. Unlike existing data exchange markets, our solution does not need any third-parties. It also provides an convenient way for data owners to audit the use of data, in order to protect data copyright and privacy. We will explain the ecosystem, and discuss the technical challenges and corresponding solutions.

AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) era new connected devices will spread highly sensitive personal data. Sending this type of data to centralized companies represents a serious risk for people's privacy, since economical or political interests could lead to an illegitimate use of personal information (as shown by Snowden's revelations). With the purpose of overcoming such status-quo, our research goal is to develop software systems according to the notion of decentralized private-by-design IoT. The basic idea is that data produced by personal IoT devices are safely stored in a distributed system whose design guarantees privacy, leaving to the people - the real data owners-the decision of which of them to share and with whom. To achieve this goal, a possible solution is to leverage the use of Peer-to-Peer storage networks in combination with the blockchain. However, such architecture, despite promising, embeds still limitations, especially in terms of scalability. In this paper we discuss our research motivation, we describe our research idea applied in a possible scenario and we present the scalability problem.

AB Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols have been actively researched for the past five years. PoS finds direct applicability in open blockchain platforms and has been seen as a strong candidate to replace the largely inefficient Proof of Work mechanism that is currently plugged in most existing open blockchains. Although a number of PoS variants have been proposed, these protocols suffer from a number of security shortcomings; for instance, most existing PoS variants suffer from the nothing at stake and the long range attacks which considerably degrade security in the blockchain.
   In this paper, we address these problems and we propose two PoS protocols that allow validators to generate at most one block at any given "height"-thus alleviating the problem of nothing at stake and preventing attackers from compromising accounts to mount long range attacks. Our first protocol leverages a dedicated digital signature scheme that reveals the identity of the validator if the validator attempts to work on multiple blocks at the same height. On the other hand, our second protocol leverages existing pervasive Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to limit the block generation requests by any given validator to a maximum of one at a given height. We analyze the security of our proposals and evaluate their performance by means of implementation; our evaluation results show that our proposals introduce tolerable overhead in the block generation and validation process when compared to existing PoS protocols.

AB Trusted execution support in modern CPUs, as offered by Intel SGX enclaves, can protect applications in untrusted environments. While prior work has shown that legacy applications can run in their entirety inside enclaves, this results in a large trusted computing base (TCB). Instead, we explore an approach in which we partition an application and use an enclave to protect only security-sensitive data and functions, thus obtaining a smaller TCB.
   We describe Glamdring, the first source-level partitioning framework that secures applications written in C using Intel SGX. A developer first annotates security sensitive application data. Glamdring then automatically partitions the application into untrusted and enclave parts: (i) to preserve data confidentiality, Glamdring uses dataflow analysis to identify functions that may be exposed to sensitive data; (ii) for data integrity, it uses backward slicing to identify functions that may affect sensitive data. Glamdring then places security-sensitive functions inside the enclave, and adds runtime checks and cryptographic operations at the enclave boundary to protect it from attack. Our evaluation of Glamdring with the Mem-cached store, the LibreSSL library, and the Digital Bitbox bitcoin wallet shows that it achieves small TCB sizes and has acceptable performance overheads.

AB Permissionless blockchains protocols such as Bitcoin are inherently limited in transaction throughput and latency. Current efforts to address this key issue focus on off-chain payment channels that can be combined in a Payment-Channel Network (PCN) to enable an unlimited number of payments without requiring to access the blockchain other than to register the initial and final capacity of each channel. While this approach paves the way for low latency and high throughput of payments, its deployment in practice raises several privacy concerns as well as technical challenges related to the inherently concurrent nature of payments that have not been sufficiently studied so far.
   In this work, we lay the foundations for privacy and concurrency in PCNs, presenting a formal definition in the Universal Composability framework as well as practical and provably secure solutions. In particular, we present Fulgor and Rayo. Fulgor is the first payment protocol for PCNs that provides provable privacy guarantees for PCNs and is fully compatible with the Bitcoin scripting system. However, Fulgor is a blocking protocol and therefore prone to deadlocks of concurrent payments as in currently available PCNs. Instead, Rayo is the first protocol for PCNs that enforces non-blocking progress (i.e., at least one of the concurrent payments terminates). We show through a new impossibility result that non-blocking progress necessarily comes at the cost of weaker privacy. At the core of Fulgor and Rayo is Multi-Hop HTLC, a new smart contract, compatible with the Bitcoin scripting system, that provides conditional payments while reducing running time and communication overhead with respect to previous approaches. Our performance evaluation of Fulgor and Rayo shows that a payment with 10 intermediate users takes as few as 5 seconds, thereby demonstrating their feasibility to be deployed in practice.

AB Blockchain has recently gained momentum. Startups, enterprises, banks, and government agencies around the world are exploring the use of blockchain for broad applications including public registries, supply chains, health records, and voting. Dependability properties, like availability, are critical for many of these applications, but the guarantees offered by the blockchain technology remain unclear, especially from an application perspective. In this paper, we identify the availability limitations of two mainstream blockchains, Ethereum and Bitcoin. We demonstrate that while read availability of blockchains is typically high, write availability-for transaction managementis actually low. For Ethereum, we collected 6 million transactions over a period of 97 days. First, we measured the time for transactions to commit as required by the applications. Second, we observed that some transactions never commit, due to the inherent blockchain design. Third and perhaps even more dramatically, we identify the consequences of the lack of built-in options for explicit abort or retry that can maintain the application in an uncertain state, where transactions remain pending (neither aborted nor committed) for an unknown duration. Finally we propose techniques to mitigate the availability limitations of existing blockchains, and experimentally test the efficacy of these techniques.

AB Blockchain is a technology of recording ledgers in a distributed manner. It uses a consensus mechanism, digital signature and hash chains to realize the reliable storage of ledgers, and provide services such as traceability, integrity and no-repudiation for transactions in ledgers in a decentralized way. These services make blockchain have great application potentiality in the fields of healthcare, Fintech, computational law and so on. Before wide spreading its applications, blockchain must solve problems such as efficiency and privacy. Among these problems the privacy is an important one. Because blocks on blockchain are open, when transactions in blocks involve privacy data, these data can be leaked. Thus, certain security mechanisms must be built to protect privacy data. The core of these mechanisms is the appropriate key management schemes. However, blockchain is a developing technology, and few studies have been done on key management schemes for it. Because healthcare is a big application scenario of blockchain, in this paper, according to the features of health blockchain, we use body sensor network to design a lightweight backup and efficient recovery scheme for keys of health blockchain. Analyses show that the scheme has high security and performance, and it can be used to protect privacy messages on health blockchain effectively and to promote the application of health blockchain.

TI Simulations on the influence of myelin water in diffusion-weighted
   imaging
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
AB While myelinated axons present an important barrier to water diffusion, many models used to interpret DWI signal neglect other potential influences of myelin. In this work, Monte Carlo simulations were used to test the sensitivity of DWI results to the diffusive properties of water within myelin. Within these simulations, the apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app) varied slowly over several orders of magnitude of the coefficient of myelin water diffusion (D-m), but exhibited important differences compared to D-app values simulated that neglect D-m (= 0). Compared to D-app, the apparent diffusion kurtosis (K-app) was generally more sensitive to D-m. Simulations also tested the sensitivity of D-app and K-app to the amount of myelin present. Unique variations in D-app and K-app caused by differences in the myelin volume fraction were diminished when myelin water diffusion was included. Also, expected trends in Dapp and Kapp with experimental echo time were reduced or inverted when accounting for myelin water diffusion, and these reduced/inverted trends were seen experimentally in ex vivo rat brain DWI experiments. In general, myelin water has the potential to subtly influence DWI results and bias models of DWI that neglect these components of white matter.

TI The Twofold Diagnosis of Personality Disorder: How Do Personality
   Dysfunction and Pathological Traits Increment Each Other at Successive
   Levels of the Trait Hierarchy?
SO PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Besides the categorical classification of personality disorders (PDs) in Section II of the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), which has been transferred as such from DSM-IV, Section III provides an alternative model to stimulate further research on the dimensional conceptualization of PDs. In this alternative system, a PD diagnosis is based on 2 essential criteria: impaired personality functioning and the presence of pathological traits. One topic that warrants further research concerns the incremental validity of these 2 components. The current study addresses this issue in a mixed community-patient sample (N = 233). First, Goldberg's (2006) "bass-ackwards" method was used to examine the hierarchical structure of pathological traits as measured by the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, 2009). We then extracted a single higher order factor from the Severity Index of Personality Problems (SIPP-118; Verheul et al., 2008) to derive 1 coherent indicator of personality dysfunction. Correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were used to determine the incremental validity of the dysfunction factor versus the trait components at succeeding levels of the DAPP-BQ hierarchy. The results only partially supported the 2-component PD diagnosis, as traits and dysfunction appeared to have only limited incremental validity. Moreover, lower order traits were generally unable to outperform higher order components in predicting specific DSM-IV PDs. Implications for the conceptualization and assessment of personality pathology are discussed.

TI Inhibitory effects of apple peel polyphenol extract on the formation of

SO MEAT SCIENCE
AB The efficacy of polyphenol-rich dried apple peel extract (DAPP) to inhibit the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs) during frying of beef patties was assessed after DAPP was applied at 0.1, 0.15 and 0.3% (w/w) either on the surface of the patties or mixed inside the patty prior to frying. 2-Amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5f]quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-1-ethyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) and 2-amino-3,4,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (4,8-DiMeIQx) were quantified after frying. HCA concentrations decreased (p < 0.05) upon both surface and mixed applications of DAPP at all of the tested doses. Surface application of 0.3% DAPP showed greater (p < 0.05) inhibitory effects on HCA formation by 68% for MeIQx, 56% for 4,8-DiMeIQx and 83% for PhIP as opposed to 41%, 21% and 60% respectively, for the mixed DAPP application of 0.3%. The present study results indicate that surface application of DAPP in meat preparation prior to pan-frying can be a useful approach to minimize the formation of genotoxic HCAs in fried beef patties.

AB In this paper, we present an empirical study of a recent spam campaign (a "stress test") that resulted in a DoS attack on Bitcoin. The goal of our investigation being to understand the methods spammers used and impact on Bitcoin users. To this end, we used a clustering based method to detect spam transactions. We then validate the clustering results and generate a conservative estimate that 385,256 (23.41 %) out of 1,645,667 total transactions were spam during the 10 day period at the peak of the campaign. We show the impact of increasing non-spam transaction fees from 45 to 68 Satoshis/byte ( from $ 0.11 to $ 0.17 USD per kilobyte of transaction) on average, and increasing delays in processing non-spam transactions from 0.33 to 2.67 h on average, as well as estimate the cost of this spam attack at 201 BTC ( or $ 49,000 USD). We conclude by pointing out changes that could be made to Bitcoin transaction fees that would mitigate some of the spam techniques used to effectively DoS Bitcoin.

AB This paper introduces a concept of autonomous blockchain based negotiation to select the most convenient electric vehicle charging station. The enabling blockchain technologies are well known fundament of cryptocurrencies, but offer many other possible applications areas, such as automated trusted machine-to-machine transactions, including auctions, bidding and payments. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, such a solution does not require any central entities and can be fully automated, including the payment for the energy. Based on e.g. the planned route, car battery status, real-time traffic information and drivers' preferences, a car could request charging bids from various charging stations along the route, by executing blockchain based smart contracts related to these charging stations. It would then select the most appropriate one based on offered prices, but other input parameters could be also taken into account, e.g. waiting times, estimated charging duration and alike. The smart contract execution could be extended to reservation and payment, too. In the paper we briefly present blockchain technologies, with the focus on Ethereum, and explain the role of smart contracts. We outline the architecture of a simple system for autonomous selection for electric vehicle charging station and provide a UML model to depict the activities of the actors involved in these operations and to clarify the role and the requirements of various blockchain related entities. The aim of our research paper is to outline a possible use-case for a blockchain prototype implementation. The implementation, which is not presented here, will serve for investigation of practical aspects of smart node development and operation, like transaction performance measurements, practical system requirement evaluations and comparison of reliability of various Ethereum clients. By our research we hope to support the investigation of novel applications and blending Internet of things with blockchain technologies, and in particular for elaboration of possible new use cases in the domain of electrical energy and mobility.

TI Diels Alder Polyphenylene Anion Exchange Membrane for Nonaqueous Redox
   Flow Batteries
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Here highly conductive, solvent-resistant anionic Diels Alder polyphenylene (DAPP) membranes were synthesized with three different ionic contents and tested in an ionic liquid-based nonaqueous redox flow battery (RFB). These membranes display 3-10x increase in conductivity in propylene carbonate compared to some commercially available (aqueous) anion exchange membranes. The membrane with an ion content of 1.5 meq/g (DAPP1.5) proved too brittle for operation in a RFB, while the membrane with an ion content of 2.5 meq/g (DAPP2.5) allowed excessive movement of solvent and poor electrochemical yields (capacity fade). Despite having lower voltage efficiencies compared to DAPP2.5, the membrane with an intermediate ion content of 2.0 meq/g (DAPP2.0) exhibited higher coulombic efficiencies (96.4% vs. 89.1%) and electrochemical yields (21.6% vs. 10.9%) after 50 cycles. Crossover of the electroactive species was the primary reason for decreased electrochemical yields. Analysis of the anolyte and catholyte revealed degradation of the electroactive species and formation of a film at the membrane-solution interface. Increases in membrane resistance were attributed to mechanical and thermal aging of the membrane; no chemical change was observed. Improvements in the ionic selectivity and ionic conductivity of the membrane will increase the electrochemical yield and voltage efficiency of future nonaqueous redox flow batteries.

AB A PVDF-HFP gel electrolytes based DSSCs were fabricated successfully, where gel electrolytes with 2.5 wt.%, 5 wt.%, 10 wt.% and 15 wt.% PVDF-HFP are included, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), photocurrent-voltage measurements and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured. As the results shown, the apparent diffusion coefficient (D-app) of I- and I-3(-) decreased as PVDF-HFP increased. Dapp of I- and I-3(-) are decreased from 1.87 x 10(-6) to 0.67 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s and 3.28 x 10(-6) to 0.88 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s, respectively. For the solar cell measurements, the short circuit current density (J(sc)) were affected by the ion motilities, which was decreased from 11.58 mA/cm(2) to 8.17 mA/cm(2), and the energy converting efficiency (eta %) was decreased from 5.17% to 2.79%. For electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements, the ionic diffusion impedance for the redox-couple (I-/I-3(-)) in the gel electrolyte was also increased with the concentration of PVDF-HFP from 0.61 Omega to 8.17 Omega. In the Bode plots, the electron lifetime (tau(e)) of the 2.5 wt.% and 5 wt.% PVDF-HFP electrolytes was increased from 40.52 ms to 48.48 ms and 41.29 ms, respectively. However, tau(e) was decreased in the concentrations of 10 wt.% and 15 wt.% PVDF-HFP, due to the ion motilities that were decreased by excessing PVDF-HFP polymer. For gel electrolyte, the cell of 2.5 wt.% PVDF-HFP exhibited a better Jsc of 10.89 mA/cm(2), a higher energy conversion efficiency (eta) of 4.75%, a higher fill factor (FF) of 61.26%, and a smaller R of 1.06 Omega than the 15 wt.% PVDF-HFP based cell.

TI Control of nanostructures generated in epoxy matrices blended with
   PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA triblock copolymers
SO EXPRESS POLYMER LETTERS
AB Stability of nanostructures of epoxy/acrylic triblock copolymer blends was studied. PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA triblock copolymers (acrylic BCPs) having several compositions on the ratio of the block chains and the molecular weight were initially prepared and were blended with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A epoxy thermosets. The blends were cured using phenol novolac with tri phenyl phosphine (TPP) as the catalyst. Several nanostructures, such as spheres, cylinders, curved lamellae, were observed in the cured blends. The nanostructures were controlled by the molecular weight of the immiscible PnBA-block chain and the ratio of the PnBA in the blends. Moreover, the effect of the gel time to the nanostructures was examined by altering the trace amount of the TPP in the blends. The types of the nanostructures were almost kept irrespective of the gel time of the blends when the composition of the blends was maintained. This suggested the stability of the nanostructures of the epoxy/acrylic BCP blends made via the self-assembly mechanism, therefore a phase diagram of the cured blends was proposed.

AB Electronic financial transactions in the US, even those enabled by Bitcoin, have relatively high transaction costs. As a result, it becomes infeasible to make micropayments, i.e. payments that are pennies or fractions of a penny.
   In order to circumvent the cost of recording all transactions, Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997) suggested the notion of a probabilistic payment, that is, one implements payments that have expected value on the order of micro pennies by running an appropriately biased lottery for a larger payment. While there have been quite a few proposed solutions to such lottery-based micropayment schemes, all these solutions rely on a trusted third party to coordinate the transactions; furthermore, to implement these systems in today's economy would require a a global change to how either banks or electronic payment companies (e.g., Visa and Mastercard) handle transactions.
   We put forth a new lottery-based micropayment scheme for any ledger-based transaction system, that can be used today without any change to the current infrastructure. We implement our scheme in a sample web application and show how a single server can handle thousands of micropayment requests per second. We provide an analysis for how the scheme can work at Internet scale.

AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that uses a decentralized architecture. It has enjoyed superiority compared to other cyptocurrencies but it has also attracted attackers to take advantage of the possible operational insecurity. All the Bitcoin miners independently try to find the winning block by finding a hash lower than a particular target. On 14th June 2014, a particular mining pool was able to take control of 51% of Bitcoins processing power, thus extracting the maximum amount of profit for their work. In this paper, we introduce a new defense against this 51% attack. We modify the present block header by introducing some extra bytes and utilize the Timestamp more effectively in the hash generation and suggest an alternative to the existing Proof-of-Work scheme. The proposed approach does not rely on finding a hash value lower than the target, rather it awards the miner involved in generating the minimum hash value across the entire distributed network. Fraudulent activities easily get caught due to effective use of the Timestamp. The new scheme thus introduces fair competition among the miners. Moreover, it facilitates the generation of Bitcoins at a fixed rate. Finally, we calculate and show how the new scheme can lead to an energy-efficient Bitcoin.

TI Simmel's Perfect Money: Fiction, Socialism and Utopia in The Philosophy
   of Money
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB This article explores the notion of 'perfect' money that Simmel introduces in The Philosophy of Money. Its aim is twofold: first, to connect this idea to his more general arguments about the nature of society and the ambivalence of modernity, and, second, to assess its relevance for contemporary debates about the future of money, especially following the global financial crisis. I argue that Simmel's concept of perfect money can be understood as utopian in two senses, conceptual and ethical, that correspond to the two interpretations he develops, in Soziologie, of the idea of a perfect society. This sheds light on an aspect of Simmel's writings that has attracted relatively little attention, namely his views on the relationship between money and socialism. Characterizing this relationship as a 'formal affinity', his remarks resonate with a long tradition of thought on monetary utopias that aim not for the abolition of money but its radical transformation as a means of improving society. This tradition is coming to the fore once again today, as the financial crisis has given new impetus to constructing forms of money - for example, LETS, Time Dollars, mutual credit, peer-to-peer lending and digital currencies such as Bitcoin - that provide viable alternatives to big banks. Understood in conjunction with his account of the 'tragedy' of individualism in modernity, such resonances demonstrate the enduring relevance of Simmel's work to the empirical and theoretical investigation of money.

TI Effect of Silanes on the Morphology, Hydrophobicity, and Dynamical
   Mechanical Properties of Polyimide/Silica Hybrid Membranes
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Polyimide (PI)/silica hybrid membranes with high contact angles were prepared through the in situ sol-gel process. The precursor, poly(amic acid) with controlled block chain length, was synthesized using 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether (ODA), 3,3',4,4'-benzophenone-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) and 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (APrTMOS) or 3-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane (APDiMOS). And then, phenyltrimethoxysilane (PTS) or tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) or methyltrimethoxysilane (MTrMOS) was respectively, added to the above polyamic acid and mixed thoroughly. Following curing reaction, the PI/silica hybrid membranes with different cross-linkages, silica content, and hydrophobic properties were prepared. The effect on the formation of PI imide ring during imidization reaction is increased as the increase of silanes content and characterized by frequency shiftment and absorbance ratio of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements. All the hybrid membranes show high transparency though with high silica contents. The storage modulus, tan delta, and damping intensity by DMA measurements are all correlated with silane content or block chain length. And all these membranes with silane content possess high contact angle as compared to pure PI without any silanes added and the contact angles increase with increasing the silane content.

TI Making Big Data Open in Edges: A Resource-Efficient Blockchain-Based
   Approach
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB The emergence of edge computing has witnessed a fast-growing volume of data on edge devices belonging to different stakeholders which, however, cannot be shared among them due to the lack of the trust. By exploiting blockchain's non-repudiation and non-tampering properties that enable trust, we develop a blockchain-based big data sharing framework to support various applications across resource-limited edges. In particular, we devise a number of novel resource-efficient techniques for the framework: (1) the PoC (Proof-of-Collaboration) based consensus mechanism with low computation complexity which is especially beneficial to the edge devices with low computation capacity, (2) the blockchain transaction filtering and offloading scheme that can significantly reduce the storage overhead, and (3) new types of blockchain transaction (i.e., Express Transaction) and block (i.e., Hollow Block) to enhance the communication efficiency. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposal.

TI Smart Contract-Based Access Control for the Internet of Things
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB This paper investigates a critical access control issue in the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, we propose a smart contract-based framework, which consists of multiple access control contracts (ACCs), one judge contract (JC), and one register contract (RC), to achieve distributed and trustworthy access control for IoT systems. Each ACC provides one access control method for a subject-object pair, and implements both static access right validation based on predefined policies and dynamic access right validation by checking the behavior of the subject. The JC implements a misbehavior-judging method to facilitate the dynamic validation of the ACCs by receiving misbehavior reports from the ACCs, judging the misbehavior and returning the corresponding penalty. The RC registers the information of the access control and misbehavior-judging methods as well as their smart contracts, and also provides functions (e.g., register, update, and delete) to manage these methods. To demonstrate the application of the framework, we provide a case study in an IoT system with one desktop computer, one laptop and two Raspberry Pi single-board computers, where the ACCs, JC, and RC are implemented based on the Ethereum smart contract platform to achieve the access control.

TI Blockchain's adoption in IoT: The challenges, and a way forward
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB The underlying technology of Bitcoin is blockchain, which was initially designed for financial value transfer only. Nonetheless, due to its decentralized architecture, fault tolerance and cryptographic security benefits such as pseudonymous identities, data integrity and authentication, researchers and security analysts around the world are focusing on the blockchain to resolve security and privacy issues of IoT. However, presently, not much work has been done to assess blockchain's viability for IoT and the associated challenges. Hence, to arrive at intelligible conclusions, this paper carries out a systematic study of the peculiarities of the IoT environment including its security and performance requirements and progression in blockchain technologies. We have identified the gaps by mapping the security and performance benefits inferred by the blockchain technologies and some of the blockchain-based IoT applications against the IoT requirements. We also discovered some practical issues involved in the integration of IoT devices with the blockchain. In the end, we propose a way forward to resolve some of the significant challenges to the blockchain's adoption in IoT.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB Using the spillover index approach and its variants, we examine both static and dynamic volatility connectedness among eight typical cryptocurrencies. The results reveal that their connectedness fluctuates cyclically and has shown an obvious rise trend since the end of 2016. In the variance decomposition framework, we further construct a volatility connectedness network linking 52 cryptocurrencies using the LASSO-VAR for estimating high-dimensional VARs. We find that these 52 cryptocurrencies are tightly interconnected and "mega-cap" cryptocurrencies are more likely to propagate volatility shocks to others. However, some unnoticeable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Maidsafe Coin) are also significant net-transmitters of volatility connectedness and even have larger contribution of volatility spillovers to others.

TI Realizing the potential of blockchain technologies in genomics
SO GENOME RESEARCH
AB Genomics data introduce a substantial computational burden as well as data privacy and ownership issues. Data sets generated by high-throughput sequencing platforms require immense amounts of computational resources to align to reference genomes and to call and annotate genomic variants. This problem is even more pronounced if reanalysis is needed for new versions of reference genomes, which may impose high loads to existing computational infrastructures. Additionally, after the compute-intensive analyses are completed, the results are either kept in centralized repositories with access control, or distributed among stakeholders using standard file transfer protocols. This imposes two main problems: (1) Centralized servers become gatekeepers of the data, essentially acting as an unnecessary mediator between the actual data owners and data users; and (2) servers may create single points of failure both in terms of service availability and data privacy. Therefore, there is a need for secure and decentralized platforms for data distribution with user-level data governance. Anew technology, blockchain, may help ameliorate some of these problems. In broad terms, the blockchain technology enables decentralized, immutable, incorruptible public ledgers. In this Perspective, we aim to introduce current developments toward using blockchain to address several problems in omics, and to provide an outlook of possible future implications of the blockchain technology to life sciences.

TI Future living framework: Is blockchain the next enabling network?
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Blockchain is not the first-and certainly will not be the last-network fever we will experience. This paper shows how blockchain networks will disrupt the urban context as well, similarly to what it is happening in the fintech and insurtech spaces, among many other emerging application domains. We put forward the Future Living Framework as the meta use case of a wider research called Blockchain4Cities. In this use case, which uses UN's New Urban Agenda (NUA) as exemplifying model, we show the benefits of using blockchain in the urban field and we do so by breaking down the NUA in policies, planning, regulations and standards and dissecting these further into Quito's Implementation Plan (QIP) themes and scopes. Use case results confirm that blockchain will disrupt urban networks, like Cybernetics did in 1948, Ekistics a decade later, and the Metabolists and Webbists in the late sixties. The Ubiquitous Computing arrived later, in the seventies, and disrupted all the previous network efforts, lasting until the current Internet of Things (IoT) and its sister concept Smart Cities, when IoT is used in an urban context. Blockchain is here to take on and be the next network for cities.

TI Quantum Attacks on Bitcoin, and How to Protect Against Them
SO LEDGER
AB The key cryptographic protocols used to secure the internet and financial transactions of today are all susceptible to attack by the development of a sufficiently large quantum computer. One particular area at risk is cryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 100 billion USD. We investigate the risk posed to Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, by attacks using quantum computers. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years, mainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates. We analyze an alternative proof-of-work called Momentum, based on finding collisions in a hash function, that is even more resistant to speedup by a quantum computer. We also review the available post-quantum signature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency requirements of blockchain applications.

TI Consortium Blockchain-Based Malware Detection in Mobile Devices
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB To address the problem of detecting malicious codes in malware and extracting the corresponding evidences in mobile devices, we construct a consortium blockchain framework, which is composed of a detecting consortium chain shared by test members and a public chain shared by users. Specifically, in view of different malware families in Android-based system, we perform feature modeling by utilizing statistical analysis method, so as to extract malware family features, including software package feature, permission and application feature, and function call feature. Moreover, for reducing false-positive rate and improving the detecting ability of malware variants, we design a multi-feature detection method of Android-based system for detecting and classifying malware. In addition, we establish a fact-base of distributed Android malicious codes by blockchain technology. The experimental results show that, compared with the previously published algorithms, the new proposed method can achieve higher detection accuracy in limited time with lower false-positive and false-negative rates.

TI A Survey on Anonymity and Privacy in Bitcoin-Like Digital Cash Systems
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Bitcoin is the most widely known distributed, peer-to-peer payment network without existence of a central authority. In Bitcoin, users do not use real names; instead, pseudonyms are used. Managing and verifying transactions and issuing of bitcoins are performed collectively by peers in the network. Since pseudonyms are used without providing any identity, it is perceived that Bitcoin provides anonymity. However, it is one of the most transparent payment networks since all transactions are publicly announced. Blockchain, which is the public ledger of Bitcoin, includes all transactions to prevent double-spending and to provide integrity. By using data in the blockchain, flow of bitcoins between transactions can be observed and activities of the users can be traced. When the implications obtained from the blockchain are combined with external data, identity and profile of a user can be revealed. This possibility has undesirable effects such as spending history of a user becomes accessible to other people, or cash flow of a merchant becomes exposed to competitors. There are several proposals as extensions or alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. This survey presents an overview and detailed investigation of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin-like digital cash systems. We examine the studies in the literature/Web in two major categories: 1) analyses of anonymity and privacy in Bitcoin and 2) extensions and alternatives to Bitcoin, which improve anonymity and privacy. We list and describe methods and outcomes for both categories and group studies according to these methods and outcomes. We also present relationships between outcomes of analyses and the improvement methods. We compare performances of the methods and show relationships between the proposals. Moreover, we present guidelines for designing an anonymity/privacy improvement and discuss future research directions.

TI How Does Social Media Impact Bitcoin Value? A Test of the Silent
   Majority Hypothesis
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Bitcoin's emergence has the potential to pave the way for a technological revolution in financial markets. What determines its valuation is an important open question with far-reaching business and policy implications. Building on information systems and finance literature, we examine the dynamic interactions between social media and the monetary value of bitcoin using textual analysis and vector error correction models. We show that more bullish forum posts are associated with higher future bitcoin values. Interestingly, social media's effects on bitcoin are driven primarily by the silent majority, the 95 percent of users who are less active and whose contributions amount to less than 40 percent of total messages. In addition, messages on an Internet forum, relative to tweets, have a stronger impact on future bitcoin value. Overall, our findings reveal that social media sentiment is an important predictor in determining bitcoin's valuation, but not all social media messages are of equal impact. This study offers new insights into the digital currency market and the economic impact of social media.

TI Secure Pub-Sub: Blockchain-Based Fair Payment With Reputation for
   Reliable Cyber Physical Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The cyber physical system (CPS) has gained considerable success in large-scale distributed integration environment. In such systems, the sensor devices collect data which would be disseminated via reliable manner to all interested co-operant entities from the physical world. However, highly unreliable environment of CPS, for example, a number of limitations of existing network middle wares, makes secure and reliable data distribution services a challenge issue. In this paper, we propose a new architecture called secure pub-sub (SPS) without middle ware, i.e., blockchain-based fair payment with reputation. In SPS, publishers publish a topic on the blockchain and subscribers specify an interest message by making a deposit to subscribing the topic. Then, if the interest message matches the topic, the publisher transmits the encrypted content of the topic to the blockchain such that the subscribers can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the content, and mark the publisher as its reputation. Finally, the publisher receives the payment from the subscriber. The new proposal provides confidentiality and reliability of data, anonymity of subscribers and payment fairness between the publishers and subscribers. Different from the traditional pub-sub services, no trusted third party is involved in our system due to employing blockchain technique. The security of the proposed SPS is analyzed as well. The implementation of the protocol on Ethereum of smart contract demonstrates the validity of SPS.

TI A Blockchain-Based Approach Towards Overcoming Financial Fraud in Public
   Sector Services
SO BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB In financial markets it is common for companies and individuals to invest into foreign companies. To avoid the double taxation of investors on dividend payment - both in the country where the profit is generated as well as the country of residence - most governments have entered into bilateral double taxation treaties, whereby investors can claim a tax refund in the country where the profit is generated. Due to easily forgeable documents and insufficient international exchange of information between tax authorities, investors illegitimately apply for these tax returns causing an estimated damage of 1.8 billion USD, for example, in Denmark alone. This paper assesses the potential of a blockchain database to provide a feasible solution for overcoming this problem against the backdrop of recent advances in the public sector and the unique set of blockchain capacities. Towards this end, we develop and evaluate a blockchain-based prototype system aimed at eliminating this type of tax fraud and increasing transparency regarding the flow of dividends. While the prototype is based on the specific context of the Danish tax authority, we discuss how it can be generalized for tracking international and interorganizational transactions.

TI Directional Age-Primitive Pattern (DAPP) for Human Age Group Recognition
   and Age Estimation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB An appropriate aging description from face image is the prime influential factor in human age recognition, but still there is an absence of a specially engineered aging descriptor, which can characterize discernible facial aging cues (e.g., craniofacial growth, skin aging) from a detailed and more finer point of view. To address this issue, we propose a local face descriptor, directional age-primitive pattern (DAPP), which inherits discernible aging cue information and is functionally more robust and discriminative than existing local descriptors. We introduce three attributes for coding the DAPP description. First, we introduce Age-Primitives encoding aging related to the most crucial texture primitives, yielding a reasonable and clear aging definition. Second, we introduce an encoding concept dubbed as Latent Secondary Direction, which preserves compact structural information in the code avoiding uncertain codes. Third, a globally adaptive thresholding mechanism is initiated to facilitate more discrimination in a flat and textured region. We apply DAPP on separate age group recognition and age estimation tasks. Applying the same approach to both of these tasks is seldom explored in the literature. Carefully conducted experiments show that the proposed DAPP description outperforms the existing approaches by an acceptable margin.

In particular, we investigate the impact of shocks on trading activity at the leading Mt. Gox exchange between April 2011 and November 2013. We find that following DDoS attacks on Mt. Gox, the number of large trades on the exchange fell sharply. In particular, the distribution of the daily trading volume becomes less skewed (fewer big trades) and had smaller kurtosis on days following DDoS attacks. The results are robust to alternative specifications, as well as to restricting the data to activity prior to March 2013, i.e., the period before the first large appreciation in the price of and attention paid to Bitcoin.

AB As data is having an increasingly relevant role in different business fields, ensuring integrity has become fundamental. Modern databases rely on transaction history written on redo logs to allow for data restore. However, if redo logs are (maliciously) forged, data can actually be lost or altered. Due its strong data integrity guarantees, blockchain technology can be employed to ensure log integrity, but its current performance limitations hinder actual exploitations.
   In previous work, we proposed a layered blockchain-based architecture for distributed (federated) database redo logs: a fast first layer blockchain, anchored to a secure second layer blockchain, based on proof-of-work to achieve strong integrity. Here, we present an implementation and an experimental evaluation of a prototype of that architecture, which employs a total consensus algorithm on the first layer blockchain. Finally, to improve availability and scalability, we refine our solution by investigating, respectively, a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus and a Distributed Hash Table solution to shard the first layer blockchain ledger among available nodes.

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The emergence of artificial general intelligence and the global brain provides new opportunities for realizing humanity's long quest for a more utopian existence. One possibility is a more successful implementation of the state socialist vision of a centrally managed economy, possibly controlled by an AGI "Nanny" instead of a central committee of politicians. An alternative outcome, more in keeping with the original Marxist vision of the withering away of the state, may be the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Offer Networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly. These and other related technologies have the potential to humanize global economic interactions, giving them more emotional resonance, as increasing affluence lessens individual and societal preoccupation with maximizing economic gain.

AB Scaling the transaction throughput of decentralized blockchain ledgers such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has been an ongoing challenge. Two-party duplex payment channels have been designed and used as building blocks to construct linked payment networks, which allow atomic and trust-free payments between parties without exhausting the resources of the blockchain.
   Once a payment channel, however, is depleted (e.g., because transactions were mostly unidirectional) the channel would need to be closed and re-funded to allow for new transactions. Users are envisioned to entertain multiple payment channels with different entities, and as such, instead of refunding a channel (which incurs costly on-chain transactions), a user should be able to leverage his existing channels to rebalance a poorly funded channel.
   To the best of our knowledge, we present the first solution that allows an arbitrary set of users in a payment channel network to securely rebalance their channels, according to the preferences of the channel owners. Except in the case of disputes (similar to conventional payment channels), our solution does not require on-chain transactions and therefore increases the scalability of existing blockchains. In our security analysis, we show that an honest participant cannot lose any of its funds while rebalancing. We finally provide a proof of concept implementation and evaluation for the Ethereum network.

AB Data assurance and resilience are crucial security issues in cloud-based IoT applications. With the widespread adoption of drones in IoT scenarios such as warfare, agriculture and delivery, effective solutions to protect data integrity and communications between drones and the control system have been in urgent demand to prevent potential vulnerabilities that may cause heavy losses. To secure drone communication during data collection and transmission, as well as preserve the integrity of collected data, we propose a distributed solution by utilizing blockchain technology along with the traditional cloud server. Instead of registering the drone itself to the blockchain, we anchor the hashed data records collected from drones to the blockchain network and generate a blockchain receipt for each data record stored in the cloud, reducing the burden of moving drones with the limit of battery and process capability while gaining enhanced security guarantee of the data. This paper presents the idea of securing drone data collection and communication in combination with a public blockchain for provisioning data integrity and cloud auditing. The evaluation shows that our system is a reliable and distributed system for drone data assurance and resilience with acceptable overhead and scalability for a large number of drones.

In this paper, we identify a new form of attack, called the Balance attack, against these forkable blockchain systems. The novelty of this attack consists of delaying network communications between multiple subgroups of nodes with balanced mining power. Our theoretical analysis captures the tradeoff between the network delay and the mining power of the attacker needed to double-spend in the GHOST protocol with high probability.
   We quantify our analysis in the settings of the Ethereum testnet of the R3 consortium where we show that a single machine needs to delay messages for 20 minutes to double spend while a coalition with a third of the mining power would simply need 4 minutes to double spend with 94% of success. We experiment the attack in our private Ethereum chain before arguing for a non-forkable blockchain design to protect against Balance attacks.

AB We present Catena, an efficiently-verifiable Bitcoin witnessing scheme. Catena enables any number of thin clients, such as mobile phones, to efficiently agree on a log of application-specific statements managed by an adversarial server. Catena implements a log as an OP_RETURN transaction chain and prevents forks in the log by leveraging Bitcoin's security against double spends. Specifically, if a log server wants to equivocate it has to double spend a Bitcoin transaction output. Thus, Catena logs are as hard to fork as the Bitcoin blockchain: an adversary without a large fraction of the network's computational power cannot fork Bitcoin and thus cannot fork a Catena log either. However, different from previous Bitcoin-based work, Catena decreases the bandwidth requirements of log auditors from 90 GB to only tens of megabytes. More precisely, our clients only need to download all Bitcoin block headers (currently less than 35 MB) and a small, 600-byte proof for each statement in a block. We implement Catena in Java using the bitcoinj library and use it to extend CONIKS, a recent key transparency scheme, to witness its public-key directory in the Bitcoin blockchain where it can be efficiently verified by auditors. We show that Catena can secure many systems today, such as public-key directories, Tor directory servers and software transparency schemes.

TI Modeling and Simulation of the Economics of Mining in the Bitcoin Market
SO PLOS ONE
AB In January 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto gave rise to the "Bitcoin Blockchain", creating the first block of the chain hashing on his computer's central processing unit (CPU). Since then, the hash calculations to mine Bitcoin have been getting more and more complex, and consequently the mining hardware evolved to adapt to this increasing difficulty. Three generations of mining hardware have followed the CPU's generation. They are GPU's, FPGA's and ASIC's generations. This work presents an agent-based artificial market model of the Bitcoin mining process and of the Bitcoin transactions. The goal of this work is to model the economy of the mining process, starting from GPU's generation, the first with economic significance. The model reproduces some "stylized facts" found in real-time price series and some core aspects of the mining business. In particular, the computational experiments performed can reproduce the unit root property, the fat tail phenomenon and the volatility clustering of Bitcoin price series. In addition, under proper assumptions, they can reproduce the generation of Bitcoins, the hashing capability, the power consumption, and the mining hardware and electrical energy expenditures of the Bitcoin network.

TI Electroanalytical sensing of indigo carmine dye in water samples using a
   cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond electrode
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB In this study, the determination of indigo carmine (IC) dye in environmental water samples by square-wave voltammetry (SWV) using a cathodically pretreated boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode is proposed. This dye showed an irreversible oxidation process onto BDD electrode with predominant hydrogen (cathodic pretreatment) or oxygen (anodic pretreatment) terminations. Comparatively, the cathodically pretreated BDD electrode provided a better performance for the anodic response of IC and, therefore, it was selected as working electrode to perform the voltammetric determinations. The electrochemical behavior of IC dye was investigated on the BDD electrode, and the electrochemical features of this molecule were determined, as the number of electrons transferred, apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) and adsorption. The neglectful adsorption of IC molecule on the BDD surface comparatively to a glassy carbon electrode surface was evidenced. Using SWV under the optimized experimental conditions, IC was determined in the linear concentration range from 0.5 to 84.1 pmol L-1, with a limit of detection of 0.058 pmol L-1. By applying assays of standard addition, IC was successfully quantified in water samples, with excellent results of recovery percentage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reputation systems are crucial for distributed applications in which users have to be made accountable for their actions, such as e-commerce websites. However, existing systems often disclose the identity of the raters, which might deter honest users from submitting reviews out of fear of retaliation from the ratees. While many privacy-preserving reputation systems have been proposed, we observe that none of them is simultaneously truly decentralized, trustless, and suitable for real world usage in, for example, e-commerce applications. In this paper, we present a blockchain based decentralized privacy-preserving reputation system. We demonstrate that our system provides correctness and security while eliminating the need for users to trust any third parties or even fellow users.

SO FEBS LETTERS
AB The plant glucan phosphatases Starch EXcess 4 (SEX4) and Like Sex Four2 (LSF2) apply different starch binding mechanisms. SEX4 contains a carbohydrate binding module, and LSF2 has two surface binding sites (SBSs). We determined K-Dapp for amylopectin and amylose, and K-D for -cyclodextrin and validated binding site mutants deploying affinity gel electrophoresis (AGE) and surface plasmon resonance. SEX4 has a higher affinity for amylopectin; LSF2 prefers amylose and -cyclodextrin. SEX4 has 50-fold lower K-Dapp for amylopectin compared to LSF2. Molecular dynamics simulations and AGE data both support long-distance mutual effects of binding at SBSs and the active site in LSF2.

AB Bitcoin has established itself as the most successful cryptocurrency with adoption seen in many commercial scenarios. While most stakeholders have jointly benefited from the growing importance of Bitcoin, conflicting interests continue to negatively impact the ecosystem. In particular, incentives to derive short-term profits from attacks on mining pools threaten the long-term viability of Bitcoin.
   We develop a game-theoretic model that allows us to capture short-term as well as long-term impacts of attacks against mining pools. Using this model, we study the conditions under which the mining pools have no incentives to launch attacks against each other (i.e., peaceful equilibria), and the conditions under which one mining pool is marginalized by attacks (i.e., one-sided attack equilibria). Our results provide guidelines for ensuring that the Bitcoin ecosystem remains long-term viable and trustworthy.

The model enables evaluations of the feasibility and cost of attacks on the Bitcoin network at full scale of 6,000 nodes. The simulation model is based on unmodified code from core segments of the Bitcoin reference implementation used by 99% of nodes. Parametrization of the model is performed based on large-scale measurements of the real-world network. We present preliminary validation results showing a reasonable correspondence of the propagation of messages in the Bitcoin network compared with simulation results. We apply the model to study the feasibility of a partitioning attack on the network and show that the attack is sensitive to the churn of the attacking nodes.

TI A hierarchical model of normal and abnormal personality up to seven

SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
AB Despite general support for dimensional models of personality disorder, it is currently unclear which, and how many, dimensions a taxonomy of this kind should include. In an attempt to obtain an empirically-based, comprehensive, and usable structure of personality, three instruments - The Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R), the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire-4 + (PDQ-4 +), and the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) - were administered to 960 outpatients and their scales factor-analyzed following a bass ackwards approach. The resulting hierarchical structure was interpretable and replicable across gender and methods up to seven factors. This structure highlights coincidences among current dimensional models and clarifies their apparent divergences, and thus helps to delineate the unified taxonomy of normal and abnormal personality that the field requires.

TI Dynamic binding capacity and specificity of
   3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridine-Sepharose support for purification of
   supercoiled plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid
SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A
AB Affinity chromatography represents a sole technique in purification of different biomolecules. The specific recognition between affinity ligands and target biomolecules has a major role in the specificity of the process. Therefore, choosing the right ligand is a crucial step for the development of a successful purification system. This work describes the application of the DNA intercalator 3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridine (DAPP) as a chromatographic affinity ligand for the specific separation and purification of super-coiled plasmid DNA (pDNA). The support was prepared by coupling DAPP onto an epoxy-activated Sepharose matrix, using mild conditions and resulting in a ligand density of 0.15 mmol DAPP/g derivatized Sepharose. The characterization of DAPP-Sepharose support in terms of dynamic binding capacity was achieved by studying the effect of plasmid DNA concentration and flow rate on pDNA adsorption. The maximum capacity value of 336.75 mu g pDNA/mL gel was obtained at 1 mL/min with a pDNA concentration of 150 mu g/mL. Moreover, the values did not vary significantly with the variation of flow rate. In addition, the DAPP-Sepharose showed a high affinity towards pDNA as quantified by the respective dissociation constant (K-d = 2.29 +/- 0.195 x 10(-7) M). The support was also tested for the purification of two plasmid molecules with different sizes (pVAX1-LacZ and pCAMBIA-1303, with 6.05 kbp and 12.361 kbp, respectively) from clarified Escherichia coli lysate solutions. Total retention of all lysate components was achieved without any added salt to the eluent buffer. The selective elution of impurities and supercoiled pDNA was accomplished simply by the addition of small amounts of salt to the buffer solution. The yield for pCAMBIA-1303 was 65% and for pVAX1-LacZ was 94%, with all host impurity levels in accordance with the requirements established by the regulatory agencies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

TI Characterization of internal structure of maize starch without amylose
   and amylopectin separation
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB Normal maize starch was used to characterize the internal structure of starch without separating amylose and amylopectin, and the result was compared with amylose-free waxy maize starch. The clusters in the whole starch were produced by partial hydrolysis using alpha-amylase of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and were subsequently treated with beta-amylase to remove the linear amylose and to produce beta-limit dextrins of clusters from amylopectin. The clusters were further hydrolyzed extensively with alpha-amylase to produce building blocks. The compositions of clusters in the form of beta-limit dextrins and their building blocks were analyzed by gel-permeation chromatography and high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. The results showed that the structures of clusters and building blocks from whole starch of normal and waxy starches were similar. By number, each cluster contained 9-10 chains and 5-6 building blocks. The inter-block chain length in the clusters of whole starch was around six glucosyl residues. This study explored an alternate procedure to characterize the composition of branches in whole starch without separating amylose and amylopectin components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Nonlinear phase-separation behavior of poly(methyl

SO POLYMER INTERNATIONAL
AB The nonlinear phase-separation behavior of poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PMMA/SMA) blends over wide appropriate temperature and heating rate ranges was studied using time-resolved small-angle laser light scattering. During the non-isothermal process, a quantitative logarithm function was established to describe the relationship between cloud point (Tc) and heating rate (k) as given by Tc = Alnk + T0, in which the parameter A, reflecting the heating rate dependence, is much different for different compositions due to phase-separation rate and activation energy difference. For the isothermal phase-separation process, an Arrhenius-like equation was successfully applied to describe the temperature dependence of the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) and the relaxation time () of the early stage as well as the late stage of spinodal decomposition (SD) of PMMA/SMA blends. Based on the successful application of the Arrhenius-like equation, the related activation energies could be obtained from Dapp and of the early and late stages of SD, respectively. In addition, these results indicate that it is possible to predict the temperature dependence of the phase-separation behavior of binary polymer mixtures during isothermal annealing over a range of 100 degrees C above the glass transition temperature using the Arrhenius-like equation.

AB We provide a first systematic account of opportunities and limitations of anti-money laundering (AML) in Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency proliferating on the Internet. Our starting point is the observation that Bitcoin attracts criminal activity as many say it is an anonymous transaction system. While this claim does not stand up to scrutiny, several services offering increased transaction anonymization have emerged in the Bitcoin ecosystem - such as Bitcoin Fog, BitLaundry, and the Send Shared functionality of Blockchain.info. Some of these services routinely handle the equivalent of 6-digit dollar amounts. In a series of experiments, we use reverse-engineering methods to understand the mode of operation and try to trace anonymized transactions back to our probe accounts. While Bitcoin Fog and Blockchain.info successfully anonymize our test transactions, we can link the input and output transactions of BitLaundry. Against the backdrop of these findings, it appears unlikely that a Know-Your-Customer principle can be enforced in the Bitcoin system. Hence, we sketch alternative AML strategies accounting for imperfect knowledge of true identities but exploiting public information in the transaction graph, and discuss the implications for Bitcoin as a decentralized currency.

TI One-way hash function construction based on the spatiotemporal chaotic
   system
SO CHINESE PHYSICS B
AB Based on the spatiotemporal chaotic system, a novel algorithm for constructing a one-way hash function is proposed and analysed. The message is divided into fixed length blocks. Each message block is processed by the hash compression function in parallel. The hash compression is constructed based on the spatiotemporal chaos. In each message block, the ASCII code and its position in the whole message block chain constitute the initial conditions and the key of the hash compression function. The final hash value is generated by further compressing the mixed result of all the hash compression values. Theoretic analyses and numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm presents high sensitivity to the message and key, good statistical properties, and strong collision resistance.

AB This work illustrates that DKI reveals white matter lesions and also discriminates healthy subjects from patientswith white matter lesions. To show this capability, we have investigated DKI images of a healthy subject and apatient with white matter lesions. The analysis was performed both between and within subjects. Regions of Interest (ROIs) for lesion and normal white matterin the patient images are selected manually (for within subject study) and also the corresponding ROIs in the healthy subject are defined (for between subject study). The results of comparing the estimated values for apparent diffusion and kurtosis parameters show that both D-app and K-app can distinguish normal and abnormal tissues. Kapp (Dapp) of the normal regions is greater (lower) than that of the abnormal regions. Another investigation over all voxels in the brain shows an important

TI Actin as a potential target for decavanadate
SO JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY
AB ATP prevents G-actin cysteine oxidation and vanadyl formation specifically induced by decavanadate, suggesting that the oxometalate-protein interaction is affected by the nucleotide. The ATP exchange rate is increased by 2-fold due to the presence of decavanadate when compared with control actin (3.1 x 10(-3) s(-1)) and an apparent dissociation constant (k(dapp)) of 227.4 +/- 25.7 mu M and 112.3 +/- 8.7 mu M was obtained in absence or presence of 20 mu M V-10, respectively. Moreover, concentrations as low as 50 mu M of decameric vanadate species (V-10) increases the relative G-actin intrinsic fluorescence intensity by approximately 80% whereas for a 10-fold concentration of monomeric vanadate (V-1) no effects were observed. Upon decavanadate titration, it was observed a linear increase in G-actin hydrophobic surface (2.6-fold), while no changes were detected for V-1 (0-200 mu M). Taken together, three major ideas arise: i) ATP prevents decavanadate-induced G-actin cysteine oxidation and vanadate reduction; ii) decavanadate promotes actin conformational changes resulting on its inactivation, iii) decavanadate has an effect on actin ATP binding site. Once it is demonstrated that actin is a new potential target for decavanadate, being the ATP binding site a suitable site for decavanadate binding, it is proposed that some of the biological effects of vanadate can be, at least in part, explained by decavanadate interactions with actin.

TI Blockchain research, practice and policy: Applications, benefits,
   limitations, emerging research themes and research agenda
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB The blockchain has received significant attention from technology focussed researchers, highlighting its perceived impact and emerging disruption potential, but has been slow to engender any significant momentum within the Information Systems (IS) and Information Management (IM) literature. This study approaches the subject through an IS/IM lens developing the key themes from the blockchain based research via a comprehensive review. This analysis of the body of literature highlights that although few commercial grade blockchain applications currently exist, the technology demonstrates significant potential to benefit a number of industry wide use cases. This study expands on this point articulating through each of the key themes to develop a detailed narrative on the numerous potential blockchain applications and future direction of the technology, whilst discussing the many barriers to adoption. The study asserts that blockchain technology has the potential to contribute to a number of the UN Sustainability Development Goals and engender widespread change within a number of established industries and practices.

TI Privacy-Preserving Energy Trading Using Consortium Blockchain in Smart
   Grid
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Implementing blockchain techniques has enabled secure smart trading in many realms, e.g. neighboring energy trading. However, trading information recorded on the blockchain also brings privacy concerns. Attackers can utilize data mining algorithms to obtain users' privacy, specially, when the user group is located in nearby geographic positions. In this paper, we present a consortium blockchain-oriented approach to solve the problem of privacy leakage without restricting trading functions. The proposed approach mainly addresses energy trading users' privacy in smart grid and screens the distribution of energy sale of sellers deriving from the fact that various energy trading volumes can be mined to detect its relationships with other information, such as physical location and energy usage. Experiment evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Understanding the Blockchain technology adoption in supply chains-Indian
   context
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Blockchain technology (BT) is expected to bring a revolutionary paradigm shift in the manner the transactions are carried in the supply chains. BT provides better visibility and transparency by removing the disadvantages of trust related issues in a supply chain. In this paper, we advance the literature on BT and its adoption in the supply chain by developing, and statistically validating a model for understanding the user perceptions on BT adoption. The model is based on the integration of three adoption theories- technology acceptance model (TAM), technology readiness index (TRI) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Based on a survey of 181 supply chain practitioners in India the proposed model was tested using structural equation modelling. The study found that the TRI constructs- Insecurity and discomfort have an insignificant effect on the perceived ease of use and usefulness. Perceived usefulness, attitude, and perceived behavioural control affect the behavioural intention. Subjective norm has a negligible impact on behavioural intention. This is one of the preliminary studies on BT adoption in supply chain and the findings imply that the supply chain practitioners perceive BT adoption free of efforts and would help them to derive maximum benefits for improving the supply chain effectiveness.

TI What determines bitcoin exchange prices? A network VAR approach
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We aim to understand the dynamics of cryptocurrency prices and, specifically, how price information is transmitted between different crypto market exchanges, and between crypto markets and traditional ones.
   To this aim, we propose an extended Vector Autoregressive model, aimed at explaining the evolution of bitcoin prices. The extension is based on network models, which improve over pure autoregressive models, as they introduce a contemporaneous contagion component, that describes contagion effects between prices.
   Our empirical findings show that the proposed model is able to well describe the correlation structure between bitcoin prices in different exchange markets, which appear rather strong, whereas the correlation of bitcoin prices with traditional assets is low. The model is also able to improve bitcoin price predictions, with respect to a simpler autoregressive model.

TI Blockchain characteristics and consensus in modern business processes
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL INFORMATION INTEGRATION
AB Blockchain technology has attracted a great deal of attentions as an effective way to innovate business processes. It has to be integrated with other Business Process Management system (BPM) components to implement specified functionalities related to the applications. The current efforts in integrating this technology into BPM are at a very early stage. To apply Blockchain into business processes efficiently, Blockchain and business process characteristics must be identified. Inconsistency of confirmation settlement that heavily relies on the implementation of consensus protocol poses a major challenge in business process operations, especially ones that are time-critical. In addition, validators, nodes responsible for performing consensus operations in a Blockchain system, can introduce bias and as a result are not trustable. This paper first defines Blockchain and also investigates the characteristics of Blockchain and business processes. Then, we suggest an architecture of business processes in Blockchain era to overcome the problems of time inconsistency and consensus bias. The architecture provides persistency, validity, auditability, and disintermediary that Blockchain offers. The architecture also provides flexibility by allowing business partner to select nodes in performing consensus; thus bias is mitigated.

TI A survey on privacy protection in blockchain system
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain, as a decentralized and distributed public ledger technology in peer-to-peer network, has received considerable attention recently. It applies a linked block structure to verify and store data, and applies the trusted consensus mechanism to synchronize changes in data, which makes it possible to create a tamper-proof digital platform for storing and sharing data. It is believed that blockchain can be utilized in diverse Internet interactive systems (e.g., Internet of Things, supply chain systems, identity management, and so on). However, there are some privacy challenges that may hinder the applications of blockchain. The goal of this survey is to provide some insights into the privacy issues associated with blockchain. We analyze the privacy threats in blockchain and discuss existing cryptographic defense mechanisms, i.e., anonymity and transaction privacy preservation. Furthermore, we summarize some typical implementations of privacy preservation mechanisms in blockchain and explore future research challenges that still need to be addressed in order to preserve privacy when blockchain is used.

TI Applications of Blockchains in the Internet of Things: A Comprehensive
   Survey
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB The blockchain technology has revolutionized the digital currency space with the pioneering cryptocurrency platform named Bitcoin. From an abstract perspective, a blockchain is a distributed ledger capable of maintaining an immutable log of transactions happening in a network. In recent years, this technology has attracted significant scientific interest in research areas beyond the financial sector, one of them being the Internet of Things (IoT). In this context, the blockchain is seen as the missing link toward building a truly decentralized, trustless, and secure environment for the IoT and, in this survey, we aim to shape a coherent and comprehensive picture of the current state-of-the-art efforts in this direction. We start with fundamental working principles of blockchains and how blockchain-based systems achieve the characteristics of decentralization, security, and auditability. From there, we build our narrative on the challenges posed by the current centralized IoT models, followed by recent advances made both in industry and research to solve these challenges and effectively use blockchains to provide a decentralized, secure medium for the IoT.

TI Securing the Internet of Things in the Age of Machine Learning and
   Software-Defined Networking
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) realizes a vision where billions of interconnected devices are deployed just about everywhere, from inside our bodies to the most remote areas of the globe. As the IoT will soon pervade every aspect of our lives and will be accessible from anywhere, addressing critical IoT security threats is now more important than ever. Traditional approaches where security is applied as an afterthought and as a "patch" against known attacks are insufficient. Indeed, next-generation IoT challenges will require a new secure-by-design vision, where threats are addressed proactively and IoT devices learn to dynamically adapt to different threats. To this end, machine learning (ML) and software-defined networking (SDN) will be key to provide both reconfigurability and intelligence to the IoT devices. In this paper, we first provide a taxonomy and survey the state of the art in IoT security research, and offer a roadmap of concrete research challenges related to the application of ML and SDN to address existing and next-generation IoT security threats.

TI A Blockchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Payment Mechanism for
   Vehicle-to-Grid Networks
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB As an integral part of V2G networks, EVs receive electricity from not only the grid but also other EVs and may frequently feed the power back to the grid. Payment records in V2G networks are useful for extracting user behaviors and facilitating decision-making for optimized power supply, scheduling, pricing, and consumption. Sharing payment and user information, however, raises serious privacy concerns in addition to the existing challenge of secure and reliable transaction processing. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preserving payment mechanism for V2G networks, which enables data sharing while securing sensitive user information. The mechanism introduces a registration and data maintenance process that is based on a blockchain technique, which ensures the anonymity of user payment data while enabling payment auditing by privileged users. Our design is implemented based on Hyperledger to carefully evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB Measurement, prediction, and modeling of currency price volatility constitutes an important area of research at both the national and corporate level. Countries attempt to understand currency volatility to set national economic policies and firms to best manage exchange rate risk and leverage assets. A relatively new technological invention that the corporate treasurer has to turn to as part of the overall financial strategy is cryptocurrency. One estimate values the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies at $557 billion USD at the beginning of 2018. While the overall size of the market for cryptocurrency is significant, our understanding of the behavior of this instrument is only beginning. In this article, we propose a hybrid Artificial Neural Network-Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ANN-GARCH) model with preprocessing to forecast the price volatility of bitcoin, the most traded and largest by market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies.

TI Designing a monitoring system to detect signals to adapt to uncertain
   climate change
SO GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS
AB Adaptive plans aim to anticipate uncertain future changes by combining low-regret short-term actions with long-term options to adapt, if necessary. Monitoring and timely detection of relevant changes, and critical transitions or tipping points is crucial to ensure successful and timely implementation and reassessment of the plan. Although efforts have been made to identify signposts to monitor, the question remains how to design a signal monitoring system that detects and anticipates (future) change to support adaptive planning. For example, to support water related infrastructure investments under uncertain climate change. What are good signposts to monitor and how to wisely analyse them to get timely and reliable signals for adaptation? In this paper, we present a framework for designing and using a monitoring plan as part of the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach for decision making under uncertainty. We use the following criteria to evaluate signposts and their critical signal values: measurability, timeliness, reliability, convincibility and institutional connectivity. We illustrate the approach based on the signal monitoring system for the adaptive plan developed by the Delta Programme in the Netherlands.

TI Apple peel polyphenols reduce mitochondrial dysfunction in mice with
   DSS-induced ulcerative colitis
SO JOURNAL OF NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTRY
AB Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are multifaceted and relapsing immune disorders, which necessitate long-term dependence on powerful drugs. As the use of natural product-based therapies has emerged as a promising intervention, the present study aimed to further characterize dried apple peel powder (DAPP) mechanisms of action and evaluate the preventive and curative effects of DAPP on mitochondrial functions in a murine model. Induction of intestinal inflammation in mice is performed by oral administration of the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) at 2.5% for 10 days. Doses of DAPP (200 or 400 mg/kg/day) were administered by gavage for 10 days pre- and 1 day after colitis induction simultaneously with DSS treatment for a period of 10 days. The preventive (200 mg/kg/ day) and therapeutic (400 mg/kg/day) doses of DAPP limited DSS-induced histological lesions, improved macroscopic parameters and attenuated clinical signs. DAPP at the same conditions reduced massive infiltration of inflammatory cells and concomitantly displayed a robust potential of counteracting inflammation and oxidative stress in DSS mice. Moreover, DAPP partially restored mitochondrial abnormalities related to size, density, redox homeostasis, fatty acid (beta-oxidation, ATP synthesis, apoptosis and regulatory mitochondrial transcription factors. Our findings demonstrate the preventive and therapeutic impact of DAPP on experimental colitis while underlying the role of mitochondria. They also suggest that this natural DAPP product may represent an interesting candidate for further studies on the prevention/treatment of IBD. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Public sector and governments have been actively exploring new technologies to enable the smart services transformation and to achieve strategic objectives such as citizens satisfaction and happiness, services efficiency and cost optimization. The Blockchain technology is a good example of an emerging technology that is attracting government attention. Many government entities such as United Kingdom, Estonia, Honduras, Denmark, Australia, Singapore and others have taken steps to unleash the potential of Blockchain technology. Dubai Government is aiming to become paperless by adopting the Blockchain technology for all transactions by 2021. The Blockchain is a disruptive technology that is playing a vital role in many sectors. It's a revolutionary technology transforming the way we think about trust as it enables transacting data in a decentralized structure without the need to have trusted central authorities. Blockchain technology promises to overcome security challenges in IoT enabled services such as enabling secure data sharing and data integrity. However, it also introduces new security challenges that should be investigated and tackled. In this paper, we review the literature to identify the potential use cases and application of Blockchain to enable government services. We also synthesized literature related to the security of Blockchain implementations to identify the security benefits, challenges and the proposed solutions. The analysis shows that is huge potential for Blockchain technology to be used in to enable smart government services. This paper also highlights future research in the areas of concerns that required further investigation.

AB The goal of this paper is to ascertain with what accuracy the direction of Bitcoin price in USD can be predicted. The price data is sourced from the Bitcoin Price Index. The task is achieved with varying degrees of success through the implementation of a Bayesian optimised recurrent neural network (RNN) and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. The LSTM achieves the highest classification accuracy of 52% and a RMSE of 8%. The popular ARIMA model for time series forecasting is implemented as a comparison to the deep learning models. As expected, the non-linear deep learning methods outperform the ARIMA forecast which performs poorly. Finally, both deep learning models are benchmarked on both a GPU and a CPU with the training time on the GPU outperforming the CPU implementation by 67.7%.

AB There are several distributed ledger protocols potentially suitable for the Internet of things (IoT), including the Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and IOTA. This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic the smart contracts and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.

AB Mobile security has become more and more important due to the boom of mobile commerce (m-commerce). However, the development of m-commerce is facing many challenges regarding data security problems. Recently, blockchain has been introduced as an effective security solution deployed successfully in many applications in practice, such as, Bitcoin, cloud computing, and Internet-of-Things. In this paper, we introduce a new m-commerce application using blockchain technology, namely, MobiChain, to secure transactions in the m-commerce. Especially, in the MobiChain application, the mining processes can be executed efficiently on mobile devices using our proposed Android core module. Through real experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model and show that blockchain will be an efficient security solution for future m-commerce.

TI An Anti-Quantum Transaction Authentication Approach in Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain is a new distributed and decentralized technology, and gradually attracts worldwide attention, but it is vulnerable to quantum attacks that would solve elliptic curve digital logarithm problem, which is mainly used for transaction authentication in blockchain. The key needed for authentication comes from the wallet. To ensure that the size of the wallet is fixed and easy to manage, deterministic wallets are required to be used. But if existing anti-quantum signature schemes, such as lattice-based signature are used directly in blockchain to solve the problem, it would have made the wallet bloat. In this paper, we present a novel anti-quantum transaction authentication scheme in the blockchain. In order to construct lightweight nondeterministic wallets, the key point is that public and private keys are generated from a set of master public and private key(Seed Key). We leverage on Bonsai Trees technology and propose a new authentication method which can extend a lattice space to multiple lattice spaces accompanied by the corresponding key. Every signature of a transaction uses a lattice space so as to ensure the randomness and the security of the master private key. And we give the complete security proof and analysis. This paper provides the theoretical support for the application of blockchain in the post quantum age.

TI Rapid screening of abused drugs by direct analysis in real time (DART)
   coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) combined with ion
   mobility spectrometry (IMS)
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL
AB Increasing in cases involving drugs of abuse leads to heavy burden for law enforcement agencies, exacerbating demand for rapid screening technique. In this study, atmospheric pressure ionization technologies including direct analysis in real time (DART) ion source coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (DART-TOF-MS) as well asdopant-assisted positive photoionization ion mobility spectrometry (DAPP-IMS) without radioactivity were utilized together as the powerful analytical tool for the rapid screening and identification of 53 abused drugs. The limits of detection (LOD) were 0.05-2 mu g/mL when using DART-TOF-MS and 0.02-2 mu g when using DAPP-IMS which could satisfy the actual requirement in forensic science laboratory. The advantages of this method included fast response, high-throughput potential, high specificity, and minimal sample preparation. A screening library of reduced mobility (K-0), accurate mass of informative precursor ion ([M+H](+)) and fragment ions was established respectively by employing a bench-top DAPP-IMS and TOF-MS in-source collision induced dissociation (CID) mode. Then the standardized screening procedure was developed with criteria for the confirmation of positive result. A total of 50 seized drug samples provided by local forensic laboratory we reanalyzed to testify the utility of the method. This study suggests that a method combing DART-TOF-MS and DAPP-IMS is promising for the rapid screening and identification of abused drugs with minimal sample preparation and absence of chromatography.

AB The diversity of energy prosumer types makes it difficult to create appropriate incentive mechanisms that satisfy both prosumers and energy system operators alike. Meanwhile, European energy suppliers buy Guarantees of Origin (GoO) which allow them to sell green energy at premium prices while in reality delivering grey energy to their customers. Blockchain technology has proven itself to be a robust paying system in which users transact money without the involvement of a third party. Blockchain tokens can be used to represent a unit of energy and, just as GoOs, be submitted to the market. This paper focuses on simulating marketplace using the Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts, where prosumers can sell tokenized GoOs to consumers willing to subsidize renewable energy producers. Such markets bypass energy providers by allowing consumers to obtain tokenized GoOs directly from the producers, which in turn benefit directly from the earnings. Two market strategies where tokens are sold as GoOs have been simulated. In the Fix Price Strategy prosumers sell their tokens to the average GoO price of 2014. The Variable Price Strategy focuses on selling tokens at a price range defined by the difference between grey and green energy. The study finds that the Ethereum Blockchain is robust enough to functions as a platform for tokenized GoO trading. Simulation results have been compared and the results indicate that prosumers earn significantly more money by following the Variable Price Strategy.

AB The potential for blockchains to fundamentally transform how organizations produce and capture value is huge and very real. Practical applications dealing with nearly any type of digital asset demonstrate this capacity. Blockchain-based application architectures benefit from a set of unique properties including immutability and transparency of cryptographically-secured and peer-recorded transactions, which have been agreed upon by network consensus. Blockchain-based applications, however, may also suffer from high computational and storage expenses, negatively impacting overall performance and scalability. In this paper, we report on lessons learned and insights gained from a set of experimental blockchain projects, focusing on off-chaining: How to move computation and data off-the-chain, without compromising the properties introduced and benefits gained by using blockchains in the first place.

AB Bitcoin owes its success to the fact that transactions are transparently recorded in the blockchain, a global public ledger that removes the need for trusted parties. Unfortunately, recording every transaction in the blockchain causes privacy, latency, and scalability issues. Building on recent proposals for "micropayment channels" - two party associations that use the ledger only for dispute resolution - we introduce techniques for constructing anonymous payment channels. Our proposals allow for secure, instantaneous and private payments that substantially reduce the storage burden on the payment network. Specifically, we introduce three channel proposals, including a technique that allows payments via untrusted intermediaries. We build a concrete implementation of our scheme and show that it can be deployed via a soft fork to existing anonymous currencies such as ZCash.

AB Surveys indicate that users are often afraid to entrust data to cloud storage providers, because these do not offer sufficient privacy. On the other hand, peer-2-peer-based privacy-preserving storage systems like Freenet suffer from a lack of contribution and storage capacity, since there is basically no incentive to contribute own storage capacity to other participants in the network.
   We address these contradicting requirements by a design which combines a distributed storage with a privacy-preserving blockchain-based payment system to create incentives for participation while maintaining user privacy. By following a Privacy-by-Design strategy integrating privacy throughout the whole system life cycle, we show that it is possible to achieve levels of privacy comparable to state-of-the-art distributed storage technologies, despite integrating a payment mechanism.
   Our results show that it is possible to combine storage contracts and payments in a privacy-preserving way. Further, our system design may serve as an inspiration for future similar architectures.

TI Volatility Analysis of Bitcoin Price Time Series
SO QUANTITATIVE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS
AB Bitcoin has the largest share in the total capitalization of cryptocurrency markets currently reaching above 70 billion USD. In this work we focus on the price of Bitcoin in terms of standard currencies and their volatility over the last five years. The average day-to-day return throughout this period is 0.328%, amounting in exponential growth from 6 USD to over 4,000 USD per 1 BTC at present. Multi-scale analysis is performed from the level of the tick data, through the 5 min, 1 hour and 1 day scales. Distribution of trading volumes (1 sec, 1 min, 1 hour and 1 day) aggregated from the Kraken BTCEUR tick data is provided that shows the artifacts of algorithmic trading (selling transactions with volume peaks distributed at integer multiples of BTC unit). Arbitrage opportunities are studied using the EUR, USD and CNY currencies. Whereas the arbitrage spread for EUR-USD currency pair is found narrow at the order of a percent, at the 1 hour sampling period the arbitrage spread for USD-CNY (and similarly EUR-CNY) is found to be more substantial, reaching as high as above 5 percent on rare occasions. The volatility of BTC exchange rates is modeled using the day-to-day distribution of logarithmic return, and the Realized Volatility, sum of the squared logarithmic returns on 5-minute basis. In this work we demonstrate that the Heterogeneous Autoregressive model for Realized Volatility Andersen et al. (2007) applies reasonably well to the BTCUSD dataset. Finally, a feed-forward neural network with 2 hidden layers using 10-day moving window sampling daily return predictors is applied to estimate the next-day logarithmic return. The results show that such an artificial neural network prediction is capable of approximate capture of the actual log return distribution, more sophisticated methods, such as recurrent neural networks and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) techniques from deep learning may be necessary for higher prediction accuracy.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency which has received increasing interest over the last five years. Built upon a decentralized peer to peer system, it supports transparent, fast, cost effective, and irreversible transactions, without the need for trusting third party financial institutions. We know however little about people's motivation and experience with bitcoin currency. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin users in Malaysia about their experience and trust challenges. Findings show that bitcoins are used more as store of value for speculative investment or savings' protection. The paper advances the HCI theories on trust by identifying main bitcoin characteristics and their impact on trust, such as decentralization, unregulation, embedded expertise, and reputation, as well as transactions' transparency, low cost, and easiness to complete. We discuss insecure transactions, the risk of dishonest traders and its mitigating strategies. The paper concludes with design implications including support for the transparency of two-way transactions, tools for materializing trust, and tools for supporting reversible transactions.

AB This paper presents the potential application of the blockchain technology in future Energy Internet operation, which would be more decentralized and self-executing. A blockchain system could solve several problems in the newly emerged scenarios with the support of the consensus mechanism, encryption methods and validation mechanism. Applying blockchains in decetralized operational framework of energy internet will bring the system with a more secure, flexible and low-cost operational solution.

AB Business processes are often related to operational processes, contracts, and regulations. Modeling such processes needs to address regulation monitoring and enforcement, and maintain a reliable history of data for evidence. This paper proposes modeling business processes as smart contracts (SCs) on permissioned blockchains (BCs). The challenges with the proposed approach are state synchronizations among distributed nodes (called authnodes), and real-time requirements. This paper separates the executions of SCs from the state managements on multi-BCs, and proposes a pipeline model to verify and create blocks in parallel.

TI Socialism and the Blockchain
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Bitcoin (BTC) is often cited as Libertarian. However, the technology underpinning Bitcoin, blockchain, has properties that make it ideally suited to Socialist paradigms. Current literature supports the Libertarian viewpoint by focusing on the ability of Bitcoin to bypass central authority and provide anonymity; rarely is there an examination of blockchain technology's capacity for decentralised transparency and auditability in support of a Socialist model. This paper conducts a review of the blockchain, Libertarianism, and Socialist philosophies. It then explores Socialist models of public ownership and looks at the unique cooperative properties of blockchain that make the technology ideal for supporting Socialist societies. In summary, this paper argues that blockchain technologies are not just a Libertarian tool, they also enhance Socialist forms of governance.

TI A Novel Delay-Aware and Privacy-Preserving Data-Forwarding Scheme for
   Urban Sensing Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB Security, communication delay, and delivery ratio are essential design issues in urban sensing networks. To address these three issues concurrently, we propose a novel delay-aware privacy-preserving (DAPP) transmission scheme based on a combination of two-phase forwarding and secret sharing. In DAPP, the collected data are first split into pieces, and then, each piece is relayed to an application data server by randomly selected intermediate delivery nodes. The two-phase forwarding method detaches the connection between the application data server and the source node, which renders it infeasible for the application data server to estimate the source node identity. The underlying secret sharing scheme and dynamic pseudonym ensure confidentiality of the collected data and anonymity of participating users. Through DAPP, we can also verify data integrity in hostile networks. Moreover, DAPP provides a framework to achieve a design tradeoff among security, communication delay, and delivery ratio. The security analysis demonstrates that DAPP can preserve location privacy while defending against side information attack. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results show that the three design issues can be adjusted to meet various security and practical implementation goals.

AB PPSS is a central primitive introduced by Bagherzandi et al. [2] which allows a user to store a secret among n servers such that the user can later reconstruct the secret with the sole possession of a single password by contacting t + 1 (t < n) servers. At the same time, an attacker breaking into t of these servers - and controlling all communication channels - learns nothing about the secret (or the password). Thus, PPSS schemes are ideal for on-line storing of valuable secrets when retrieval solely relies on a memorizable password.
   We show the most efficient Password-Protected Secret Sharing (PPSS) to date (and its implied Threshold-PAKE scheme), which is optimal in round communication as in Jarecki et al. [10] but which improves computation and communication complexity over that scheme requiring a single per-server exponentiation for the client and a single exponentiation for the server. As with the schemes from [10] and Camenisch et al. [4] we do not require secure channels or PKI other than in the initialization stage.
   We prove the security of our PPSS scheme in the Universally Composable (UC) model. For this we present a UC definition of PPSS that relaxes the UC formalism of [4] in a way that enables more efficient PPSS schemes (by dispensing with the need to extract the user's password in the simulation) and present a UC-based definition of Oblivious PRF (OPRF) that is more general than the (Verifiable) OPRF definition from [10] and is also crucial for enabling our performance optimization.

AB Classical results on secure multi-party computation (MPC) imply that fully secure computation, including fairness (either all parties get output or none) and robustness (output delivery is guaranteed), is impossible unless a majority of the parties is honest. Recently, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin where utilized to leverage the fairness loss in MPC against a dishonest majority. The idea is that when the protocol aborts in an unfair manner (i.e., after the adversary receives output) then honest parties get compensated by the adversarially controlled parties. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we put forth a new formal model of secure MPC with compensation and show how the introduction of suitable ledger and synchronization functionalities makes it possible to describe such protocols using standard interactive Turing machines (ITM) circumventing the need for the use of extra features that are outside the standard model as in previous works. Second, our model, is expressed in the universal composition setting with global setup and is equipped with a composition theorem that enables the design of protocols that compose safely with each other and within larger environments where other protocols with compensation take place; a composition theorem for MPC protocols with compensation was not known before. Third, we introduce the first robust MPC protocol with compensation, i.e., an MPC protocol where not only fairness is guaranteed (via compensation) but additionally the protocol is guaranteed to deliver output to the parties that get engaged and therefore the adversary, after an initial round of deposits, is not even able to mount a denial of service attack without having to suffer a monetary penalty. Importantly, our robust MPC protocol requires only a constant number of (coin-transfer and communication) rounds.

TI CUSTODY CHAINS AND ASSET VALUES: WHY CRYPTO-SECURITIES ARE WORTH
   CONTEMPLATING
SO CAMBRIDGE LAW JOURNAL
AB Computerisation facilitates instantaneous and direct links between all of us in our work and social lives. At the same time, and counter-intuitively so, securities are increasingly held indirectly through chains of custodians that operate between issuers and investors. This disconnects investors from issuers and can significantly reduce the value of assets. The regulatory framework does not prevent this effect. UK-regulated holders of client securities should be required to hold these directly in the name of the investor. At an international level, it is worth asking whether the technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be used to create an un-intermediated securities ledger connecting investors and issuers directly.

TI Seven basic dimensions of personality pathology and their clinical
   consequences: Are all personalities equally harmful?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB ObjectivesDimensional pathology models are increasingly being accepted for the assessment of disordered personalities, but their ability to predict negative outcomes is yet to be studied. We examine the relative clinical impact of seven basic dimensions of personality pathology through their associations with a wide range of clinical outcomes.
   MethodsA sample of 960 outpatients was assessed through a 7-factor model integrating the Cloninger, the Livesley, and the DSM taxonomies. Thirty-six indicators of clinical outcome covering three areas - dissatisfaction, functional difficulties, and clinical severity - were also assessed. The unique contribution of each personality dimension to clinical outcome was estimated through multiple regressions.
   ResultsOverall, personality dimensions explained 17.6% of the variance of clinical outcome, but varied substantially in terms of their unique contributions. Negative Emotionality had the greatest impact in all areas, contributing 43.9% of the explained variance. The remaining dimensions led to idiosyncratic patterns of clinical outcomes but had a comparatively minor clinical impact. A certain effect was also found for combinations of dimensions such as Negative Emotionality x Impulsive Sensation Seeking, but most interactions were clinically irrelevant.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the most relevant dimensions of personality pathology are associated with very different clinical consequences and levels of harmfulness.

TI Cell Free DNA of Tumor Origin Induces a 'Metastatic' Expression Profile
   in HT-29 Cancer Cell Line
SO PLOS ONE
AB Background
   Epithelial cells in malignant conditions release DNA into the extracellular compartment. Cell free DNA of tumor origin may act as a ligand of DNA sensing mechanisms and mediate changes in epithelial-stromal interactions.
   Aims
   To evaluate and compare the potential autocrine and paracrine regulatory effect of normal and malignant epithelial cell-related DNA on TLR9 and STING mediated pathways in HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and normal fibroblasts.
   Materials and Methods
   DNA isolated from normal and tumorous colonic epithelia of fresh frozen surgically removed tissue samples was used for 24 and 6 hour treatment of HT-29 colon carcinoma and HDF-alpha fibroblast cells. Whole genome mRNA expression analysis and qRT-PCR was performed for the elements/members of TLR9 signaling pathway. Immunocytochemistry was performed for epithelial markers (i.e. CK20 and E-cadherin), DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and NF kappa B (for treated HDFa cells).
   Results
   Administration of tumor derived DNA on HT29 cells resulted in significant (p<0.05) mRNA level alteration in 118 genes (logFc >= 1, p <= 0.05), including overexpression of metallothionein genes (i.e. MT1H, MT1X, MT1P2, MT2A), metastasis-associated genes (i.e. TACSTD2, MACC1, MALAT1), tumor biomarker (CEACAM5), metabolic genes (i.e. INSIG1, LIPG), messenger molecule genes (i.e. DAPP, CREB3L2). Increased protein levels of CK20, E-cadherin, and DNMT3a was observed after tumor DNA treatment in HT-29 cells. Healthy DNA treatment affected mRNA expression of 613 genes (logFc >= 1, p <= 0.05), including increased expression of key adaptor molecules of TLR9 pathway (e.g. MYD88, IRAK2, NF kappa B, IL8, IL-1 beta), STING pathway (ADAR, IRF7, CXCL10, CASP1) and the FGF2 gene.
   Conclusions
   DNA from tumorous colon epithelium, but not from the normal epithelial cells acts as a prometastatic factor to HT-29 cells through the overexpression of pro-metastatic genes through TLR9/MYD88 independent pathway. In contrast, DNA derived from healthy colonic epithelium induced TLR9 and STING signaling pathway in normal fibroblasts.

AB In this paper, we examine cryptocurrencies as a potentially disruptive sort of payment method. Due to its relative importance, we focus in particular on Bitcoin. Through an inductive, exploratory interview approach with 13 individuals in three distinct groups, the determinants usability, usefulness, and subjective norm that could make Bitcoin a game-changer are explored. The results reveal that most stakeholders consider perceived ease of use still rather low, with perceived usefulness varying according to the user group. The notion of Bitcoin as having much future potential as a payment method is confirmed across all interviewees. Interestingly, the underlying concept of a blockchain is also seen as a potential revolutionary way to create a more just society based on open platforms and open data. However, the reasons of why Bitcoin is actually a disruption to existing solutions varies widely.

AB Sulfide stress cracking resistance of welded high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel for high pressure vessel (called "WDL690D" steel) was evaluated in NACE "A" solution at room temperature. Though the failure time increased with the decreasing applied stress for either WDL690D base steel or its welded joint, the welded joint presented the lower threshold stress of about 53% YS compared with the base steel of about 65% YS, because of its inhomogeneous microstructure distribution. The hydrogen trapping efficiency of the WDL6900 base steel and its welded joint was also investigated by measuring the permeability 1,0I. and the apparent diffusivity (Dapp). The results showed that the welded joint had lower trapping efficiency, but was more susceptible to SSC. In addition, the fractography of both the WDL690D base steel and its welded joint all exhibited a mixed ductile-brittle rupture when exposed in H2S environment under constant loading stress.

AB The Bitcoin scheme is the most popular and talked about alternative payment scheme. One of the most active parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem was the Silk Road marketplace, in which highly illegal substances and services were traded. It was run by a person who called himself Dread Pirate Roberts (DPR), whose bitcoin holdings are estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars at today's exchange rate. On October 1-st 2013, the FBI arrested a 29 year old person named Ross William Ulbricht, claiming that he is DPR, and seizing a small fraction of his bitcoin wealth. In this paper we use the publicly available record to trace the evolution of his holdings in order to find how he acquired and how he tried to hide them from the authorities. In particular, we trace the amounts he seemingly received and the amounts he seemingly transferred out of his accounts, and show that all his Silk Road commissions from the months of May, June and September 2013, along with numerous other amounts, were not seized by the FBI. This analysis demonstrates the power of data mining techniques in analyzing large payment systems, and especially publicly available transaction graphs of the type provided by the Bitcoin scheme.

TI Measuring alpha 4 beta 2*nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density in
   vivo with [F-18]nifene PET in the nonhuman primate
SO JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB [F-18]Nifene is an agonist PET radioligand developed to image alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This work aims to quantify the receptor density (B-max) of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs and the in vivo (apparent) dissociation constant (K-Dapp) of [F-18]nifene. Multiple-injection [F-18]nifene experiments with varying cold nifene masses were conducted on four rhesus monkeys with a microPET P4 scanner. Compartment modeling techniques were used to estimate regional B-max values and a global value of K-Dapp. The fast kinetic properties of [F-18]nifene also permitted alternative estimates of B-max and K-Dapp at transient equilibrium with the same experimental data using Scatchard-like methodologies. Averaged across subjects, the compartment modeling analysis yielded B-max values of 4.8 +/- 1.4, 4.3 +/- 1.0, 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 1.2 +/- 0.3 pmol/mL in the regions of antereoventral thalamus, lateral geniculate, frontal cortex, and subiculum, respectively. The K-Dapp of nifene was 2.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/nnL. The Scatchard analysis based on graphical evaluation of the data after transient equilibrium yielded B-max estimations comparable to the modeling results with a positive bias of 28%. These findings show the utility of [F-18]nifene for measuring alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR B-max in vivo in the rhesus monkey with a single PET experiment.

The temperature dependence of tack was measured by a probe tack test. The tack of MAM/MA at room temperature was significantly higher than that of MAM, and the improvement of MAM/MA upon the addition of the tackifier was higher than that of MAM. The peeling process at the probe/adhesive interface during the probe tack test was observed using a high-speed microscope. It was found that for MAM/MA, cavitation was caused in the entire adhesive layer, and peeling initiation was delayed by the absorption of strain energy due to deformation of the adhesive layer. In contrast, for MAM, peeling progressed linearly from the edge to the center of the probe. The greater flexibility of the soft block chain in the diblock copolymer resulted in improved interfacial adhesion. 1H pulse nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed that the addition of the tackifier improved the cohesive strength of the adhesive. Adhesion strength is affected by two factors: the development of interfacial adhesion and cohesive strength. In the MAM/MA/tackifier system, the presence of MA and the tackifier improved the interfacial adhesion and cohesive strength, respectively. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 2013

TI Hindering false event dissemination in VANETs with proof-of-work
   mechanisms
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB Solutions for a secure data dissemination in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are increasingly adopting robust cryptography schemes as more lightweight, trust-based approaches often lead to serious problems such as illusion, collusion and sybil attacks, to name a few. This article shows that it is possible to hinder the dissemination of false warning events in VANETs and limit the amount of messages a node can send within a given period of time by applying well-known cryptographic techniques. To achieve this twofold goal, the method we present is based on two simple concepts already used in security mechanisms to provide accountability and to combat spam and denial of service attacks, namely the use of certificates and Proof-of-Work (POW) systems respectively. Basically, our scheme not only discourages nodes from transmitting fake event warning messages but also serves as an effective non-repudiation evidence for different types of dishonest behavior within a VANET. Our analyses on both the performance and security of our scheme show its feasibility in VANETs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   air logistics in the blockchain technology era
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
AB Supply chain operations have entered the digital era with the emergence of blockchain technology. In this paper, we discuss how the mean-variance (MV) approach can be applied to explore global supply chain operations risk with air logistics in the blockchain technology era. To be specific, we examine the related literature from four areas, namely air-logistics operations, demand management, supply management, and supply-demand coordination. We propose how the blockchain technology can be applied to facilitate the implementation of mean-variance risk analysis for global supply chain operations. We then highlight several promising areas for further studies. A future research agenda is developed.

TI Block-DEF: A secure digital evidence framework using blockchain
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB A secure digital evidence system should ensure that evidence cannot be tampered with and that private information cannot be leaked. Blockchain, a distributed tamper-resistant and privacy-preserving ledger, provides a promising solution for decentralized secure digital evidence systems. However, due to the huge number of digital evidences and the contradiction between the traceability and the privacy of evidence, blockchain faces big data and privacy challenges. To solve the above issues, we propose a secure digital evidence framework using blockchain (Block-DEF) with a loose coupling structure in which the evidence and the evidence information are maintained separately. Only the evidence information is stored in the blockchain, and the evidence is stored on a trusted storage platform. To avoid blockchain bloat, a lightweight blockchain combining a mixed block structure with an optimized name-based practical byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism is proposed. To support the traceability and the privacy of evidence, the multi-signature technique is adopted for evidence submission and retrieval. The analytical and experimental results show that Block-DEF is a scalable framework, it guarantees the integrity and validity of evidence, and balances privacy and traceability well.

TI Blockchain-based mobile fingerprint verification and automatic log-in
   platform for future computing
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Door locks and user authentication are the major issues in the current banking industry. There are a number of user future computing techniques, and security is especially essential to these methods. Existing digital door locks have the problem of opening easily with a stolen PIN number or by electrical shock. Thus, this study proposed and implemented an integrated automatic log-in platform based on mobile fingerprint recognition by applying the blockchain theory. As a result of this research, a convenient, integrated automatic log-in platform with powerful security has been constructed using a smartphone-based fingerprint recognition function. There are three major functions of the platform. First, it is possible to authenticate the user in PC, mobile device, and IoT environments through fingerprint recognition. Second, the platform includes SDK to develop application software for user authentication and IoT services. Last is its strengthened security using the blockchain theory to prepare against tampering/forging/leaking of a user's fingerprint information by hackers.

TI Blockchain adoption challenges in supply chain: An empirical
   investigation of the main drivers in India and the USA
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB The digitalization phenomenon is leveraging new relationship models through the entire supply chain network. In this outlook, blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is already transforming and remodeling the relationships between all members of logistics and supply chain systems. Yet, while studies on blockchain have gained a relative pace over the recent years, the literature on this topic does not report sufficient research cases on blockchain adoption behavior at the individual level. The present study, therefore, aims to bridge this gap, notably by helping understand the individual blockchain adoption behavior in the logistics and supply chain field in India and the USA. Drawing on the emerging literature on blockchain, supply chain and network theory, as well as on technology acceptance models (TAMs), we have developed a model based on a slightly-altered version of the classical unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The model being developed was then estimated using the Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). As the model was eventually supported, the results obtained revealed the existence of distinct adoption behaviors between India-based and USA-based professionals. In parallel, the findings appear as a useful contribution to and a sign of progress for the literature on IT adoption, SCM, and blockchain.

TI Blockchain Disruption and Smart Contracts
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB Blockchain technology provides decentralized consensus and potentially enlarges the contracting space through smart contracts. Meanwhile, generating decentralized consensus entails distributing information that necessarily alters the informational environment. We analyze how decentralization relates to consensus quality and how the quintessential features of blockchain remold the landscape of competition. Smart contracts can mitigate informational asymmetry and improve welfare and consumer surplus through enhanced entry and competition, yet distributing information during consensus generation may encourage greater collusion. In general, blockchains sustain market equilibria with a wider range of economic outcomes. We further discuss the implications for antitrust policies targeted at blockchain applications.

AB The cyber security of modern power systems has drawn increasing attention in both academia and industry. Many detection and defense methods for cyber-attacks have therefore been proposed to enhance robustness of modern power systems. In this paper, we propose a new, distributed blockchain-based protection framework to enhance the self-defensive capability of modern power systems against cyber-attacks. We present a comprehensive discussion on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance the robustness and security of the power grid, by using meters as nodes in a distributed network which encapsulates meter measurements as blocks. Effectiveness of the proposed protection framework is demonstrated via simulation experiments on the IEEE-118 benchmark system.

SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This paper examines the causal relationship between Bitcoin attention (measured by the Google Trends search queries) and Bitcoin returns for the period from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017. For this purpose, we employ the Copula-based Granger Causality in Distribution (CGCD) test. After implementing various robustness checks, we observe that there is a bi-directional causal relationship between Bitcoin attention and Bitcoin returns with the exception of the central distributions from 40% to 80%. To put it differently, the bidirectional causality mainly exists in the left tail (poor performance) and the right tail (superior performance) of the distribution.

TI Blockchain Technology in the Oil and Gas Industry: A Review of
   Applications, Opportunities, Challenges, and Risks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology has been developed for more than ten years and has become a trend in various industries. As the oil and gas industry is gradually shifting toward intelligence and digitalization, many large oil and gas companies were working on blockchain technology in the past two years because of it can significantly improve the management level, efficiency, and data security of the oil and gas industry. This paper aims to let more people in the oil and gas industry understand the blockchain and lead more thinking about how to apply the blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest papers on the review of the blockchain system in the oil and gas industry. This paper first presents the relevant theories and core technologies of the blockchain, and then describes how the blockchain is applied to the oil and gas industry from four aspects: trading, management and decision making, supervision, and cyber security. Finally, the application status, the understanding level of the blockchain in the oil and gas industry, opportunities, challenges, and risks and development trends are analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) at present, Europe and Asia have the fastest pace of developing the application of blockchain in the oil and gas industry, but there are still few oil and gas blockchain projects in operation or testing worldwide; 2) nowadays, the understanding of blockchain in the oil and gas industry is not sufficiently enough, the application is still in the experimental stage, and the investment is not enough; and (3) blockchain can bring many opportunities to the oil and gas industry, such as reducing transaction costs and improving transparency and efficiency. However, since it is still in the early stage of the application, there are still many challenges, primarily technological, and regulatory and system transformation. The development of blockchains in the oil and gas industry will move toward hybrid blockchain architecture, multi-technology combination, cross-chain, hybrid consensus mechanisms, and more interdisciplinary professionals.

TI A Survey on Consensus Mechanisms and Mining Strategy Management in
   Blockchain Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.

AB Technology has become ubiquitous, it is all around us and is becoming part of us. Together with the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm and enabling technologies (e.g., Augmented Reality (AR), Cyber-Physical Systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain or edge computing), smart wearables and IoT-based garments can potentially have a lot of influence by harmonizing functionality and the delight created by fashion. Thus, smart clothes look for a balance among fashion, engineering, interaction, user experience, cybersecurity, design and science to reinvent technologies that can anticipate needs and desires. Nowadays, the rapid convergence of textile and electronics is enabling the seamless and massive integration of sensors into textiles and the development of conductive yarn. The potential of smart fabrics, which can communicate with smartphones to process biometric information such as heart rate, temperature, breathing, stress, movement, acceleration, or even hormone levels, promises a new era for retail. This article reviews the main requirements for developing smart IoT-enabled garments and shows smart clothing potential impact on business models in the medium-term. Specifically, a global IoT architecture is proposed, the main types and components of smart IoT wearables and garments are presented, their main requirements are analyzed and some of the most recent smart clothing applications are studied. In this way, this article reviews the past and present of smart garments in order to provide guidelines for the future developers of a network where garments will be connected like other IoT objects: the Internet of Smart Clothing.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we quantify the cross-correlations between Google Trends and Bitcoin market. By employing the Multifractal Detrended Cross-correlation Analysis (MF-DCCA) method, we find that the change of Google Trends (CGT) and Bitcoin market, i.e., returns and changes of volume, are overall significantly cross-correlated based on the cross correlation test. In particular, the empirical results show that: (1) there exist power-law cross-correlations between CGT and Bitcoin returns as well as CGT and changes of volume; (2) the cross-correlations between CGT and returns have a higher degree of multifractal in the long-term and weak multifractal in the short-term, while the cross-correlations between CGT and change of volume show the opposite trend. (3) with the rolling window analysis, we further find that there is a decrease trend for the cross-correlations between CGT and Bitcoin returns over time, and the cross-correlations scaling exponents are less than 0.5, which indicate that they are both anti-persistent cross-correlated.

TI Block-secure: Blockchain based scheme for secure P2P cloud storage
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB With the development of Internet technology, the volume of data is increasing tremendously. To tackle with large-scale data, more and more applications choose to enlarge the storage capacity of users' terminals with the help of cloud platforms. Before storing data to an untrusted cloud server, some measures should be adopted to guarantee the data security. However, the communication overhead will increase dramatically when users transmit files encrypted by a traditional encryption scheme. In this paper, we address the above problems by proposing a blockchain-based security architecture for distributed cloud storage, where users can divide their own files into encrypted data chunks, and upload those data chunks randomly into the P2P network nodes that provide free storage capacity. We customize a genetic algorithm to solve the file block replica placement problem between multiple users and multiple data centers in the distributed cloud storage environment. Numerical results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud storage architectures in terms of file security and network transmission delay. On average, the file loss rate based on the simulation assumptions utilized in this paper is close to 0% on our architecture while it's nearly 100% and 71.66% on the architecture with single data center and the distributed architecture using genetic algorithm. Besides, with proposed scheme, the transmission delay on the proposed architecture is reduced by 39.28% and 76.47% on average on the user's number and the number of file block replicas, respectively, in comparison to the architecture with single data center. Meanwhile, the transmission delay of file block replicas is also reduced by 41.36% on average than that on the distributed architecture using genetic algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

TI A Proposed Solution and Future Direction for Blockchain-Based
   Heterogeneous Medicare Data in Cloud Environment
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB The healthcare data is an important asset and rich source of healthcare intellect. Medical databases, if created properly, will be large, complex, heterogeneous and time varying. The main challenge nowadays is to store and process this data efficiently so that it can benefit humans. Heterogeneity in the healthcare sector in the form of medical data is also considered to be one of the biggest challenges for researchers. Sometimes, this data is referred to as large-scale data or big data. Blockchain technology and the Cloud environment have proved their usability separately. Though these two technologies can be combined to enhance the exciting applications in healthcare industry. Blockchain is a highly secure and decentralized networking platform of multiple computers called nodes. It is changing the way medical information is being stored and shared. It makes the work easier, keeps an eye on the security and accuracy of the data and also reduces the cost of maintenance. A Blockchain-based platform is proposed that can be used for storing and managing electronic medical records in a Cloud environment.

AB This paper discusses the dynamics of intraday prices of 12 cryptocurrencies during the past months' boom and bust. The importance of this study lies in the extended coverage of the cryptoworld, accounting for more than 90% of the total daily turnover. By using the complexity-entropy causality plane, we could discriminate three different dynamics in the data set. Whereas most of the cryptocurrencies follow a similar pattern, there are two currencies (ETC and ETH) that exhibit a more persistent stochastic dynamics, and two other currencies (DASH and XEM) whose behavior is closer to a random walk. Consequently, similar financial assets, using blockchain technology, are differentiated by market participants. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI Peer to Peer Distributed Energy Trading in Smart Grids: A Survey
SO ENERGIES
AB Due to the expansion of distributed renewable energy resources, peer to peer energy trading (P2P DET) is expected to be one of the key elements of next generation power systems. P2P DET can provide various benefits such as creating a competitive energy market, reducing power outages, increasing overall efficiency of power systems and supplementing alternative sources of energy according to user preferences. Because of these promising advantages, P2P DET has attracted the attention of several researchers. Current research related to P2P DET include demand response optimization, power routing, network communication, security and privacy. This paper presents a review of the main research topics revolving around P2P DET. Particularly, we present a comprehensive survey of existing demand response optimization models, power routing devices and power routing algorithms. We also identify some key challenges faced in realizing P2P DET. Furthermore, we discuss state of the art enabling technologies such as Energy Internet, Blockchain and Software Defined Networking (SDN) and we provide insights into future research directions.

TI Long- and Short-Term Cryptocurrency Volatility Components: A GARCH-MIDAS
   Analysis
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB We use the GARCH-MIDAS model to extract the long- and short-term volatility components of cryptocurrencies. As potential drivers of Bitcoin volatility, we consider measures of volatility and risk in the US stock market as well as a measure of global economic activity. We find that S&P 500 realized volatility has a negative and highly significant effect on long-term Bitcoin volatility. The finding is atypical for volatility co-movements across financial markets. Moreover, we find that the S&P 500 volatility risk premium has a significantly positive effect on long-term Bitcoin volatility. Finally, we find a strong positive association between the Baltic dry index and long-term Bitcoin volatility. This result shows that Bitcoin volatility is closely linked to global economic activity. Overall, our findings can be used to construct improved forecasts of long-term Bitcoin volatility.

TI Secure and Energy-Efhcient Handover in Fog Networks Using
   Blockchain-Based DMM
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Modern fog network architectures, empowered by IoT applications and 5G communications technologies, are characterized by the presence of a huge number of mobile nodes, which undergo frequent handovers, introducing a significant load on the involved network entities. Considering the distributed and flat nature of these architectures, DMM can be the only viable option for efficiently managing handovers in these scenarios. The existing DMM solutions are capable of providing smooth handovers, but lack robustness from the security point of view. Indeed, DMM depends on external mechanisms for handover security and uses a centralized device, which has obvious security and performance implications in flat architectures where hierarchical dependencies can introduce problems. We propose a new DMM schema based on the blockchain, capable of resolving hierarchical security issues without affecting the network layout, and also satisfying fully distributed security requirements with less consumption of energy.

AB Now, the authors' life is full of vast amount of information, the era of information has arrived. So the content-centric networks face severe challenges in dealing with a huge range of content requests, bringing protection and sharing concerns of the content. How to protect information in the network efficiently and securely for the upcoming 5G era has become a problem. The authors propose a scheme based on a blockchain to solve the privacy issues in content-centric mobile networks for 5G. The authors implement the mutual trust between content providers and users. Besides, the openness and tamper-resistant of the blockchain ledger ensure the access control and privacy of the provider. With the help of a miner, selected from users, the authors can maintain the public ledger expediently. Also, in return, the authors share the interesting data with low overhead, network delay and congestion, and then achieve green communication.

TI A Sustainable Home Energy Prosumer-Chain Methodology with Energy Tags
   over the Blockchain
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB In this paper, we aim to provide a power trade system that will promote a sustainable electrical energy transaction ecosystem between prosumers and consumers of smart homes. We suggest a blockchain-based peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transaction platform be implemented to enable efficient electrical energy transaction between prosumers. We suggest the platform be built on the blockchain, as this technology allows a decentralized and distributed trading system, and allows a more transparent, trustworthy and secure P2P trading environment. We believe that such characteristics of the blockchain are necessary in electrical energy transactions within the smart home environment because the smart home aims to enhance user comfort and security, along with energy conservation and cost-savings. First, we classify the two different types of P2P trade to identify which will best benefit from the use of the suggested blockchain-based P2P energy-transaction platform. Within the two types of P2P trade, that we classify (pure P2P trade and hybrid P2P trade), the hybrid P2P trade will benefit more from a blockchain-based P2P energy-transaction platform. In the blockchain-based P2P energy-transaction platform, a smart contract is embedded in the blockchain and called an energy tag. The energy tag will set conditions for making every future energy transaction more cost-efficient while maintaining the most ideal and high-quality energy selection. With the blockchain-based energy tag in the energy-transaction process, multiple energy resources and home appliances will be democratically connected in order to provide users with high-quality, low-cost energy at all times and locations. In this paper, we provide simulation results that compare the unit price of electrical energy on the suggested platform to the unit price of electrical energy set by currently existing conventional power-generation companies. Additionally, we present simulation results that calculate how long initial investments to create a smart home environment that enables P2P energy transactions will take to be paid back. Based on simulation results, we believe that, in the long run, the suggested blockchain-based P2P energy-transaction platform will create a sustainable energy-transaction environment between consumers and prosumers, and the expanding ecosystem will enable the development of a trusted, sustainable, secure and energy-efficient energy transaction environment.

TI Business model innovation and value-creation: the triadic way
SO JOURNAL OF SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Building on the multi-divisional business model (M-model), the purpose of this paper is to develop a better understanding of triadic business models - T-models - and how they create value for their three categories of stakeholders, i.e., the suppliers, the platform firm and the buyers. The research question that guides the present study is twofold: How is value created individually and collectively in triadic business models and what might challenge their sustainability?
   Design/methodology/approach Anchored in extant literature and a process of conceptual modeling with empirical examples from Uber, a new business model archetype was developed for two-sided markets mediated by a middleman.
   Findings The paper provides a theoretically and conceptually derived roadmap for sustainable business in a triadic business model, i.e., for the buyers, sellers and the platform firm. This model is coined the T-model. A number of propositions are derived that argue the relationship between key constructs. Finally, the future beyond the T-model is explored.
   Research limitations/implications The paper identifies, illustrates and discusses the ways in which value is created in sustainable T-models. First, value is created from a number of sources, not only from lower transaction costs. Second, it is proposed that it is not about a choice of either M-model or T-model but rather a continuum. Toward 2050, technology in general and Blockchain specifically may for some transactions or services, eliminate the need for middlemen. The main conclusion is that despite this development, there will, for most organizations, be elements of the M-model in all or most T-model businesses. In short: middlemen will have elements of the M-model embedded in the T-model when co creating value with buyers and sellers.
   Originality/value While two-sided T-models are not new to the business area, surprisingly no papers have systematically investigated, illustrated, and discussed how value is created among and between the three stakeholder categories of the T-model. With this insight, more sustainable T-models can be created.

TI Governance in the Blockchain Economy: A Framework and Research Agenda

CL Hilton Waikoloa Village, HI
AB Blockchain technology is often referred to as a groundbreaking innovation and the harbinger of a new economic era. Blockchains may be capable of engendering a new type of economic system: the blockchain economy. In the blockchain economy, agreed-upon transactions would be enforced autonomously, following rules defined by smart contracts. The blockchain economy would manifest itself in a new form of organizational design-decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)-which are organizations with governance rules specified in the blockchain. We discuss the blockchain economy along dimensions defined in the IT governance literature: decision rights, accountability, and incentives. Our case study of a DAO illustrates that governance in the blockchain economy may depart radically from established notions of governance. Using the three governance dimensions, we propose a novel IT governance framework and a research agenda for governance in the blockchain economy. We challenge common assumptions in the blockchain discourse, and propose promising information systems research related to these assumptions.

TI Spillovers between Bitcoin and other assets during bear and bull markets
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB This article contributes to the embryonic literature on the relations between Bitcoin and conventional investments by studying return and volatility spillovers between this largest cryptocurrency and four asset classes (equities, stocks, commodities, currencies and bonds) in bear and bull market conditions. We conducted empirical analyses based on a smooth transition VAR GARCH-in-mean model covering daily data from 19 July 2010 to 31 October 2017. We found significant evidence that Bitcoin returns are related quite closely to those of most of the other assets studies, particularly commodities, and therefore, the Bitcoin market is not isolated completely. The significance and sign of the spillovers exhibited some differences in the two market conditions and in the direction of the spillovers, with greater evidence that Bitcoin receives more volatility than it transmits. Our findings have implications for investors and fund managers who are considering Bitcoin as part of their investment strategies and for policymakers concerned about the vulnerability that Bitcoin represents to the stability of the global financial system.

AB Blockchain technology becomes increasingly popular. It also attracts scams, for example, Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes on blockchain by using data mining and machine learning methods. By verifying smart contracts on Ethereum, we first extract features from user accounts and operation codes of the smart contracts and then build a classification model to detect latent Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy for practical use. More importantly, the approach can be used to detect Ponzi schemes even at the moment of its creation. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 400 Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.

TI Proof of Delivery of Digital Assets Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB There is an immense need of a proof of delivery (PoD) of today's digital media and content, especially those that are subject to payment. Current PoD systems are mostly centralized and heavily dependent on a trusted third party (TTP) especially for payment. Such existing PoD systems often lack security, transparency, and visibility, and are not highly credible, as the TTP can be subject to failure, manipulation, corruption, compromise, and hacking. In this paper, we propose a decentralized PoD solution for PoD of digital assets. Our solution leverages key features of blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts to provide immutable and tamper-proof logs, accountability, and traceability. Ethereum smart contracts are used to orchestrate and govern all interactions and transactions including automatic payments in Ether cryptocurrency between customers, digital-content provider, and the file server hosting the digital content. All entities are incentivized to act honestly, and our solution has a mechanism to handle dispute if arisen among participants. The solution has an off-chain secure download phase involving the file server and customers. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of interplanetary file system to store the agreed upon terms and conditions between the smart contract actors. A security analysis of our proposed system has been provided. The full code of the smart contract has been publicly made available on Github.

TI Adaptive Blockchain-Based Electric Vehicle Participation Scheme in Smart
   Grid Platform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The electric vehicle (EV) charging scheme can reduce the power generation costs and improve the smart grid resilience. However, the huge penetrations of EVs can impact the voltage stability and operating costs. In this paper, a novel EV participation charging scheme is proposed for a decentralized blockchain-enabled smart grid system. Our objectives are to minimize the power fiuctuation level in the grid network and the overall charging cost for EV users. We first formulate the power fiuctuation level problem of the smart grid system that take into accounts of EV battery capacities, charging rates, and EV users charging behavior. And then, we propose a novel adaptive blockchain-based electric vehicle participation (AdBEV) scheme that uses the Iceberg order execution algorithm to obtain an improved EV charging and discharging schedule. The simulation results show the proposed scheme outperforms the scheme that applying genetic algorithm approach in term of lowering the power fiuctuation level and overall charging costs.

TI The evolution of the bitcoin economy: Extracting and analyzing the
   network of payment relationships
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose This paper aims to gather together the minimum units of users' identity in the Bitcoin network (i.e. the individual Bitcoin addresses) and group them into representations of business entities, what we call super clusters. While these clusters can remain largely anonymous, the authors are able to ascribe many of them to particular business categories by analyzing some of their specific transaction patterns (TPs), as observed during the period from 2009 to 2015. The authors are then able to extract and create a map of the network of payment relationships among them, and analyze transaction behavior found in each business category. They conclude by identifying three marked regimes that have evolved as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage; to a second growth stage populated in large part with sin enterprise (i.e. gambling, black markets); to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from sin and toward legitimate enterprises.
   Design/methodology/approach Data mining.
   Findings Four primary business categories are identified in the Bitcoin economy: miners, gambling services, black markets and exchanges. Common patterns of transaction behavior between the business categories and their users are a one-day holding period for bitcoin transactions is somewhat typical. That is, a one-day effect where traders, gamblers, black market participants and miners tend to cash out on a daily basis. There seems to be a strong preference to do business within the bitcoin economy in round lot amounts, whether it is more typical of traders exchanging for fiat money, gamblers placing bets or black market goods being bought and sold. Distinct patterns of transaction behavior among the business categories and their users are flows between traders and exchanges average just around 20 BTC, and traders buy or sell on average every 11 days. Meanwhile, gamblers wager just 0.5 BTC on average, but re-bet often within the same day. Three marked regimes have evolved, as the Bitcoin economy has grown and matured: from an early prototype stage, to a second growth stage populated in large part with sin enterprises (i.e. gambling, black markets), to a third stage marked by a sharp progression away from sin and toward legitimate enterprises. This evolution of the Bitcoin economy suggests a trend toward legitimate commerce.
   Originality/value The authors propose a new theoretical framework that allows investigating and exploring the network of payment relationships in the Bitcoin economy. This study starts by gathering together the minimum units of Bitcoin identities (the individual addresses), and it goes forward in grouping them into approximations of business entities, what is called super clusters, by using tested techniques from the literature. A super cluster can be thought of as an approximation of a business entity in that it describes a number of individual addresses that are owned or controlled collectively by the same beneficial owner for some special economic purposes. The majority of these important clusters are initially unknown and uncategorized. The novelty of this study is given by the pure user group and the TP analyses, by means of which the authors are able to ascribe the super clusters into specific business categories and outline a map of the network of payment relationships among them.

SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper aims to strive to close the current research gap pertaining to potential implications of the blockchain for supply chain management (SCM) by presenting a framework built on four established economic theories, namely, principal agent theory (PAT), transaction cost analysis (TCA), resource-based view (RBV) and network theory (NT). These theories can be used to derive research questions that are theory-based as well as relevant for the industry. This paper is intended to initiate and stimulate an academic discussion on the potential impact of the blockchain and introduces a framework for middle-range theorizing together with several research questions.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper builds on previous theories that are frequently used in SCM research and shows how they can be adapted to blockchain-related questions.
   Findings This paper introduces a framework for middle-range theorizing together with several research questions.
   Research limitations/implications The paper presents blockchain-related research questions derived from four frequently used theories, namely, PAT, TCA, RBV and (NT). These questions will guide future research pertaining to structural (PAT, TCA) and managerial issues (RBV, NT) and will foster middle-range theory development in SCM research.
   Practical implications Blockchain technology has the potential to significantly change SCM. Given the huge investments by industry, academic research is needed which investigates potential implications and supports companies. In this paper, various research questions are introduced that illustrate how the implications of blockchain on SCM can be investigated from different perspectives.
   Originality/value To the best of the author's knowledge, no academic papers are published in leading academic journals that investigate the relationship between SCM and blockchain from a theory-based perspective.

TI RapidChain: Scaling Blockchain via Full Sharding

AB A major approach to overcoming the performance and scalability limitations of current blockchain protocols is to use sharding which is to split the overheads of processing transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. These groups work in parallel to maximize performance while requiring significantly smaller communication, computation, and storage per node, allowing the system to scale to large networks. However, existing sharding-based blockchain protocols still require a linear amount of communication (in the number of participants) per transaction, and hence, attain only partially the potential benefits of sharding. We show that this introduces a major bottleneck to the throughput and latency of these protocols. Aside from the limited scalability, these protocols achieve weak security guarantees due to either a small fault resiliency (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or high failure probability, or they rely on strong assumptions (e.g., trusted setup) that limit their applicability to mainstream payment systems.
   We propose RapidChain, the first sharding-based public blockchain protocol that is resilient to Byzantine faults from up to a 1/3 fraction of its participants, and achieves complete sharding of the communication, computation, and storage overhead of processing transactions without assuming any trusted setup. RapidChain employs an optimal intra-committee consensus algorithm that can achieve very high throughputs via block pipelining, a novel gossiping protocol for large blocks, and a provably-secure reconfiguration mechanism to ensure robustness. Using an efficient cross-shard transaction verification technique, our protocol avoids gossiping transactions to the entire network. Our empirical evaluations suggest that RapidChain can process (and confirm) more than 7,300 tx/sec with an expected confirmation latency of roughly 8.7 seconds in a network of 4,000 nodes with an overwhelming time-to-failure of more than 4,500 years.

TI Blockchain-Empowered Fair Computational Resource Sharing System in the
   D2D Network
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Device-to-device (D2D) communication is becoming an increasingly important technology in future networks with the climbing demand for local services. For instance, resource sharing in the D2D network features ubiquitous availability, flexibility, low latency and low cost. However, these features also bring along challenges when building a satisfactory resource sharing system in the D2D network. Specifically, user mobility is one of the top concerns for designing a cooperative D2D computational resource sharing system since mutual communication may not be stably available due to user mobility. A previous endeavour has demonstrated and proven how connectivity can be incorporated into cooperative task scheduling among users in the D2D network to effectively lower average task execution time. There are doubts about whether this type of task scheduling scheme, though effective, presents fairness among users. In other words, it can be unfair for users who contribute many computational resources while receiving little when in need. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based credit system that can be incorporated into the connectivity-aware task scheduling scheme to enforce fairness among users in the D2D network. Users' computational task cooperation will be recorded on the public blockchain ledger in the system as transactions, and each user's credit balance can be easily accessible from the ledger. A supernode at the base station is responsible for scheduling cooperative computational tasks based on user mobility and user credit balance. We investigated the performance of the credit system, and simulation results showed that with a minor sacrifice of average task execution time, the level of fairness can obtain a major enhancement.

TI Low oxytocin levels are related to alexithymia in anorexia nervosa
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
AB ObjectiveAnorexia nervosa is associated with social-emotional functioning deficits and low levels of the social neurohormone oxytocin, even after weight gain. The relationship between low oxytocin levels and social-emotional functioning impairment has not been studied.
   MethodWe performed a cross-sectional study of 79 women (19 who were less than 85% of ideal body weight [IBW] with anorexia nervosa [AN], 26 who were 90-120% IBW with a history of AN [AN-WR], and 34 who were 90-120% IBW with no eating disorder history [H]). We administered the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale-Self Report (LSAS-SR), Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ; suspiciousness and insecure attachment subscales), and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). We also analyzed fasting serum oxytocin levels.
   ResultsMost measures of social-emotional functioning showed impairment in women with AN and AN-WR compared to H. Oxytocin levels were low in AN-WR compared to H. Across groups, low oxytocin levels were associated with difficulty identifying feelings (r=-.45, p=.008) and overall alexithymia (r=-.34, p=.0489).
   DiscussionWe speculate that low oxytocin levels may contribute to alexithymia in women with anorexia nervosa.

TI Toward a Philosophy of Blockchain: A Symposium: Introduction
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB This article introduces the symposium Toward a Philosophy of Blockchain, which provides a philosophical contemplation of blockchain technology, the digital ledger software underlying cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, for the secure transfer of money, assets, and information via the Internet without needing a third-party intermediary. The symposium offers philosophical scholarship on a new topic, blockchain technology, from a variety of perspectives. The philosophical themes discussed include mathematical models of reality, signification, and the sociopolitical institutions that structure human life and interaction. The symposium also investigates the metaphilosophical theme of how to create a philosophy of anything, specifically a new topic such as blockchain technology. Repeated themes are identified, in all areas of philosophical inquiry (ontology, epistemology, and axiology), and conceptual resources are elaborated to contribute to a philosophical understanding of blockchain technology. Thus, philosophy as a metaphilosophical approach is shown to be able to provide an understanding of the conceptual, theoretical, and foundational dimensions of novelty and emergence in the world, with a particular focus on blockchain technology.

Using stochastic control techniques, we compute analytically the optimal portfolio weights and relate our result to several other strategies commonly used by practitioners, including the static double-threshold strategy. Finally, we apply our model to a bitcoin portfolio and conduct an out-of-sample test with historical data from three exchanges, with two cointegrating relations.

TI Digital sustainability: basic conditions for sustainable digital
   artifacts and their ecosystems
SO SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
AB The modern age has heralded a shift from the industrial society, in which natural resources are crucial input factors for the economy, towards a knowledge society. To date, sustainability literature has treated knowledge-and in particular digital artifacts-mainly as a means to the end of achieving sustainable development. In this conceptual paper, we argue that digital artifacts themselves ought also to be considered as resources, which also need to be sustainable. While over-consumption is a problem facing natural resources, with sustainable digital artifacts, underproduction, and underuse are the biggest challenges. In our view, the sustainability of digital artifacts improves their potential impact on sustainable development. A theoretical foundation for digital artifacts and their ecosystem allows us to present the relevant research on digital information, knowledge management, digital goods, and innovation literature. Based on these insights, we propose ten basic conditions for sustainable digital artifacts and their ecosystem to ensure that they provide the greatest possible benefit for sustainable development. We then apply those characteristics to four exemplary cases: Linux kernel development, Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the Wikipedia project, and the Linking Open Drug Data repositories. The paper concludes with a research agenda identifying topics for sustainability scholars and information systems academics, as well as practitioners. A number of suggestions for future studies on digital sustainability are also put forward.

AB Trust Management (TM) systems for authentication are vital to the security of online interactions, which are ubiquitous in our everyday lives. Various systems, like the Web PKI (X.509) and PGP's Web of Trust are used to manage trust in this setting. In recent years, blockchain technology has been introduced as a panacea to our security problems, including that of authentication, without sufficient reasoning, as to its merits.
   In this work, we investigate the merits of using open distributed ledgers (ODLs), such as the one implemented by blockchain technology, for securing TM systems for authentication. We formally model such systems, and explore how blockchain can help mitigate attacks against them. After formal argumentation, we conclude that in the context of Trust Management for authentication, blockchain technology, and ODLs in general, can offer considerable advantages compared to previous approaches. Our analysis is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to formally model and argue about the security of TM systems for authentication, based on blockchain technology. To achieve this result, we first provide an abstract model for TM systems for authentication. Then, we show how this model can be conceptually encoded in a blockchain, by expressing it as a series of state transitions. As a next step, we examine five prevalent attacks on TM systems, and provide evidence that blockchain-based solutions can be beneficial to the security of such systems, by mitigating, or completely negating such attacks.

TI Equihash: Asymmetric Proof-of-Work Based on the Generalized Birthday
   Problem
SO LEDGER
AB Proof-of-work is a central concept in modern cryptocurrencies and denial-of-service protection tools, but the requirement for fast verification so far has made it an easy prey for GPU-, ASIC-, and botnet-equipped users. The attempts to rely on memory-intensive computations in order to remedy the disparity between architectures have resulted in slow or broken schemes. In this paper we solve this open problem and show how to construct an asymmetric proof-of-work (PoW) based on a computationally-hard problem, which requires a great deal of memory to generate a proof (called a "memory-hardness" feature) but is instant to verify. Our primary proposal, Equihash, is a PoW based on the generalized birthday problem and enhanced Wagner's algorithm for it. We introduce the new technique of algorithm binding to prevent cost amortization and demonstrate that possible parallel implementations are constrained by memory bandwidth. Our scheme has tunable and steep time-space tradeoffs, which impose large computational penalties if less memory is used. Our solution is practical and ready to deploy: a reference implementation of a proof-of-work requiring 700 MB of RAM runs in 15 seconds on a 2.1 GHz CPU, increases the computations by a factor of 1000 if memory is halved, and presents a proof of just 120 bytes long.

AB Zero Knowledge Contingent Payment (ZKCP) protocols allow fair exchange of sold goods and payments over the Bitcoin network. In this paper we point out two main shortcomings of current proposals for ZKCP, and propose ways to address them.
   First we show an attack that allows a buyer to learn partial information about the digital good being sold, without paying for it. This break in the zero-knowledge condition of ZKCP is due to the fact that in the protocols we attack, the buyer is allowed to choose common parameters that normally should be selected by a trusted third party. We implemented and tested this attack: we present code that learns, without paying, the value of a Sudoku cell in the "Pay-to-Sudoku" ZKCP implementation [18]. We also present ways to fix this attack that do not require a trusted third party.
   Second, we show that ZKCP are not suited for the purchase of digital services rather than goods. Current constructions of ZKCP do not allow a seller to receive payments after proving that a certain service has been rendered, but only for the sale of a specific digital good. We define the notion of Zero-Knowledge Contingent Service Payment (ZKCSP) protocols and construct two new protocols, for either public or private verification. We implemented our ZKCSP protocols for Proofs of Retrievability, where a client pays the server for providing a proof that the client's data is correctly stored by the server. We also implement a secure ZKCP protocol for "Pay-to-Sudoku" via our ZKCSP protocol, which does not require a trusted third party.
   A side product of our implementation effort is a new optimized circuit for SHA256 with less than a quarter than the number of AND gates of the best previously publicly available one. Our new SHA256 circuit may be of independent use for circuit-based MPC and FHE protocols that require SHA256 circuits.

AB After years of tremendous development and research in digital currency, the most famous Bitcoin industry chain has been gradually completed including mining, exchange, currency exchange, ATM, pervasive digital wallet design and so on. Especially, its blockchain technology has become FinTech organizations' emerging business and research directions, also been applied in the interdisciplinary medical science, supply chain and Internet of things. Digitizing currency can solve many problems in physical currency, such as the rampant counterfeit banknotes. Thus, not only the transparency can be cost-effectively preserved in store's ledger, but also customer's rights and interests can be protected while using the digital wallet. For the government, the regulation and auditing of financial transaction can be made simpler and more convenient for tax collection issue. Digitized transaction details can be much easier to audit by any computing device than manually audit the conventional ledger books. Furthermore, to make merchandise store to use digitized currency much easier, in this paper, we propose and deploy a Bitcoin collection supervision system called BPCSS based on blockchain technology with cloud databases for customers and merchandise stores. The preliminary experimental results via the well-known pervasive digital wallet of Testnet Bitcoin demonstrate the proposed BPCSS can cost-effectively collect payment and supervise the transactions between customer and merchandise store running the implemented NFC-enabled Android Apps.

TI Accuracy of diffusion kurtosis imaging in characterization of breast
   lesions
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion kurtosis in the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions.
   Methods: 49 females with 53 breast lesions underwent breast MRI. The MRI magnetic field is 1.5 T, and the protocol is standard MRI sequences, dynamic sequences pre- and post-contrast agent administration and diffusion images. Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) was applied as part of our standard breast MR. protocol. Two experienced radiologists on breast MRI, blinded to the final diagnosis, reviewed the parametric maps and placed a volume of interest on all slices including each lesion. Kurtosis [K apparent (K-app)] and corrected apparent diffusion coefficient [D apparent (D-app)] median values were then calculated from the whole-lesion histogram analysis. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the most effective cut-off values for the differentiation between benign and malignant pathologies. Histological analysis of the breast lesions was performed, and further comparative analysis of the results was performed to investigate the accuracy of the method.
   Results: Benign (n - 19) and malignant lesions (n -34) had mean diameters of 20.8mm (10.1-31.5mm) and 26.4mm (10.5-42.3mm), respectively. The lowest and the highest kurtosis values (K-app) of malignant lesions were significantly higher than those of benign lesions. A cut-off of 0.71 provided specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity 97.1%, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.976 (p < 0.0001). The lowest and the highest D-app values of malignant lesions were lower than those of benign lesions. A cut-off value of 1.57 x 10(-3) mm(2) s(-1) provided specificity of 93.7% and sensitivity of 91.2% with AUC of 0.949 (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: DKI is an accurate additional tool for the characterization and differentiation of breast lesions with high Kapp and Dapp sensitivity and specificity rates.
   Advances in knowledge: DKI is able to distinguish benign from malignant breast pathologies. DKI increases the specificity of breast MRI.

Management of electronic health records, where both conformation to legislative regulations and maintenance of public trust are paramount, is an area where the impact of these new technologies may be particularly beneficial. We present a system that enables fine-grained personalized control of third party access to patients' electronic health records, allowing individuals to specify when and how their records are accessed for research purposes. The use of the smart contract based Ethereum blockchain technology to implement this system allows it to operate in a verifiably secure, trustless, and openly auditable environment, features crucial to health information systems moving forward.

AB Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners.
   Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics.
   This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and "discovering" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.
   Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three concurrent threads.

AB In this paper, we design a distributed platform for anonymized dataset trading without any centralized trusted third party. The platform consists of peers and consensus-based blockchain mechanism, and each peer acts as a data broker, data receiver, or verifier for blockchain in a data transfer transaction. A data broker collects data from data owners under their consent for data trading. The Privacy Policy Manager (PPM) manages the consent information and confirms them on behalf of data owners, when data distribution is requested from data broker. We implement a prototype system of the platform using an open-source blockchain mechanism, Hyperledger Fabric, and provide evaluation results of the prototype system.

AB The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool that has the potential to positively impact the way we design a number of online applications today. In many ways, the blockchain technology is, however, still not mature enough to cater for industrial standards. Namely, existing Byzantine tolerant permission-based blockchain deployments can only scale to a limited number of nodes. These systems typically require that all transactions (and their order of execution) are publicly available to all nodes in the system, which comes at odds with common data sharing practices in the industry, and prevents a centralized regulator from overseeing the full blockchain system.
   In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain architecture devised specifically to meet industrial standards. Our proposal leverages the notion of satellite chains that can privately run different consensus protocols in parallel-thereby considerably boosting the scalability premises of the system. Our solution also accounts for a "hands-off" regulator that oversees the entire network, enforces specific policies by means of smart contracts, etc. We implemented our solution and integrated it with Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 [2].

AB ECDSA is a standard digital signature schemes that is widely used in TLS, Bitcoin and elsewhere. Unlike other schemes like RSA, Schnorr signatures and more, it is particularly hard to construct efficient threshold signature protocols for ECDSA (and DSA). As a result, the best-known protocols today for secure distributed ECDSA require running heavy zero-knowledge proofs and computing many large-modulus exponentiations for every signing operation. In this paper, we consider the specific case of two parties (and thus no honest majority) and construct a protocol that is approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the previous best. Concretely, our protocol achieves good performance, with a single signing operation for curve P-256 taking approximately 37ms between two standard machine types in Azure (utilizing a single core only). Our protocol is proven secure under standard assumptions using a game-based definition. In addition, we prove security by simulation under a plausible yet non-standard assumption regarding Paillier.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. As a database and computational platform, blockchain has both advantages and disadvantages compared with conventional techniques. Blockchain may be an appropriate choice for some use cases while conventional technologies will be more appropriate for other use cases. A major difficulty for practitioners to decide whether or not to use blockchain is that limited product data or reliable technology evaluation available to assess the suitability of blockchains. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework that comprises a list of criteria and a typical process for practitioners to assess the suitability of applying blockchain using these criteria based on the characteristics of the use cases. We then use several existing industrial trails to evaluate the feasibility of our framework

AB In recent years novel models for energy distribution appeared and islanded microgrids quest for new ways to exchange energy between consumers and producers without the need of central authorities. The blockchain mechanism has emerged as a distributed solution for recording energy transactions in power systems. The blockchain has been used to permit users bartering and selling energy and to keep track of such exchanges without exposing them to tampering. In this work, we consider a novel application of the blockchain in islanded microgrids that includes also annotating energy losses caused by energy transactions, in order to have a more realistic matching between the physical status of the energy grid and the consequent costs attributed to users. To validate our novel use of the blockchain, we carried out simulated experiments for an exemplary islanded microgrid, in which 3 main generators supply 6 load nodes. This validates the compatibility of this new cost attribution model with the supporting physical infrastructure. Preliminary results demonstrate that the superposition of energy transactions in a microgrid changes the distribution of losses in all paths, eventually due to the large reactive flows created by PV systems.

TI Characteristics of suicidal outpatients with mood, anxiety and
   somatoform disorders: The role of childhood abuse and neglect
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: The most prevalent psychiatric disorders are mood, anxiety and somatoform (MAS) disorders which show high mutual comorbidity, childhood trauma and elevated risk of suicidality. So far, no studies have compared suicide risk in a secondary care population with comorbid MAS disorders. This gap was taken as starting point for the study.
   Aims: In comparing suicidal and non-suicidal MAS patients, the following was examined: suicide risk in the three disorder groups, socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, occurrence of childhood trauma types and contribution of childhood trauma to suicidality.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study compared suicidal (n=316) versus non-suicidal comorbid MAS outpatients (n=929) by means of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus (MINI-Plus), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Short Form (DAPP-SF) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ).
   Results: Compared to non-suicidal MAS patients, suicidal MAS patients mostly had mood disorders (single/comorbid), multiple diagnoses, worse functioning, more personality pathology (self-harm) and more childhood neglect and abuse.
   Conclusion: Especially (comorbid) depressed patients are at risk for suicide, and routine screening and monitoring of childhood trauma and suicidality in them are recommended, along with the timely deployment of appropriate trauma-focused psychotherapy.

We first discuss current reputation systems, conducting a critical analysis of their current security vulnerabilities, before looking at how new blockchain-based technologies are used. We propose an innovative new reputation system that is based on blockchain technologies and which aims to solve many unanswered questions in the current generation of reputation systems, as well as blockchain systems in general. We then consider the limitations of such a system, before using simulations and analyses to demonstrate methods of overcoming these limitations, and in doing so, provide a possible solution to a fundamental issue in blockchain-based networks; scalability. We conclude by suggesting areas for future studies, and summarizing our findings.

TI The use of crypto-currencies in funding violent jihad
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to look at current discourse on the topic of crypto-currencies, more specifically Bitcoins, and their application to funding acts of terror. The paper clearly establishes the risks posed by this new payment technology and value transfer system to assist in the process of funding, planning and implementing acts of terror.
   Design/methodology/approach - Publications, blogs and sites published and administered by terrorists groups and their supporters are examined to determine their interest in leveraging emerging payment and value transfer systems to facilitate the funding, planning and implementation of terror attacks. Press releases and other publications are also examined to determine whether cryptocurrencies have been used by these groups in fund raising, fund transfer or recent terror attacks.
   Findings - Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence of largescale use of Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies by terrorist groups and their supporters, there is strong evidence to suggest that they have been linked to a number of terror attacks in Europe and Indonesia. Supporters of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), jihadists and terrorist organisations are actively looking to and promoting the use of new and emerging technologies, such as Bitcoin, to mitigate some of the risks associated with traditional fund transfer methods. Some websites associated with terrorist organisations have started to collect donations in Bitcoins. Many Bitcoin ATMs and Bitcoin exchanges are located in countries that have seen significant numbers of foreign fighters join ISIS in the Middle East and are also positioned in countries that have seen increased risk of terror attack. These present a significant risk because they allow for the seamless, anonymous transfer of funds to and from terrorist groups and their supporters. The paper highlights the need for further in-depth research into reliable ways to circumvent the current difficulties experienced in differentiating illicit transactions from legitimate ones and establishing reliable means of attribution.
   Originality/value - Using a document published by ISIS, which provides would-be jihadists detailed instructions on how they can get to Syria or Iraq without being detected, a set of models were created showing how this could be achieved using Bitcoins alone. From this scenario, red flag indicators and suspicious behaviour models have been created to determine whether they can be identified during detailed analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain which will be conducted in later stages of research.

AB One of the current problems of peer-to-peer-based file storage systems like Freenet is missing participation, especially of storage providers. Users are expected to contribute storage resources but may have little incentive to do so. In this paper we propose KopperCoin, a token system inspired by Bitcoin's blockchain which can be integrated into a peer-to-peer file storage system. In contrast to Bitcoin, KopperCoin does not rely on a proof of work (PoW) but instead on a proof of retrievability (PoR). Thus it is not computationally expensive and instead requires participants to contribute file storage to maintain the network. Participants can earn digital tokens by providing storage to other users, and by allowing other participants in the network to download files. These tokens serve as a payment mechanism. Thus we provide direct reward to participants contributing storage resources.

Existing solutions adopt blockchain protocols to improve the credibility of transactions. Most of them still have significant scalability barrier, such as instant transaction and throughput. By analyzing how fundamental and circumstantial bottlenecks in Bitcoin-derived blockchain limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer overlay network, this paper presents Permissioned Blockchain Framework (PBF). PBF aims at achieving trusted trading and supporting instant transaction in E-commerce. To guarantee a higher credibility of transactions, this paper presents a global consensus algorithm - Permissioned Trusted Trading Network Consensus Algorithm. In order to fulfill the demand of instant transactions without sacrificing credibility, this paper presents a Peer Inner Blockchain Protocol. The comparison between PBF and Bitcoin-derived blockchain in E-commerce, suggests better performance on throughput, latency, capacity.

TI Accounting for the Bitcoin: accountability, neoliberalism and a
   correspondence analysis
SO MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH
AB Purpose - Given its innovative characteristics and increasing popularity, the Bitcoin, and other virtual currencies, are expected to become mainstream, leading to the need for a generally accepted accounting treatment. Currently, however, there are no accounting standards which offer guidance on the recognition and measurement of these virtual currencies. To this end, the purpose of this paper is to determine a conceptual approach for accounting for the Bitcoin, grounded in the theories of neoliberalism and stewardship.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research adopts an interpretive mixed-method approach. The relevant literature is analysed to identify key characteristics of the Bitcoin. These, as well as the elements of accounting policies inspired by neoliberalism and stewardship, form row and column headings in a correspondence matrix completed by 40 financial reporting experts. The correlations between rows and columns (developed using principal component analysis) are used to identify possible recognition and measurement requirements for the Bitcoin. Semi-structured interviews are used to complement the correspondence analysis.
   Findings - The correspondence analysis and interviews reveal an emphasis on cost and fair value proposed by models grounded in stewardship and neoliberalism, respectively. The primary factor at work is the need to account for the underlying economics of the unit of account, something which is informed heavily by an organisation's business model. Cost and fair value may be conceptual opposites, but in the eyes of respondents, these need to be used to achieve the single goal of communicating the economic rationale for holding the Bitcoin.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is based on a purposefully selected sample of experts and lacks the exploratory potential of purely qualitative research. Nevertheless, it makes novel use of a correspondence analysis to provide an initial frame of reference for developing an accounting policy for unusual transactions and balances.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first to provide a normative perspective on the accounting for this poorly understood "currency". It also adds to the limited body of interpretive accounting research which dispenses with traditional finance paradigms and positivist models to provide practical recommendations. Finally, the paper offers an innovative approach, using a correspondence analysis and detailed interviews, for developing an accounting policy for transactions not specifically within the scope of existing accounting standards.

AB Polystyrene latex particles with controlled size were prepared by polymerization of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion styrene droplets obtained through the phase inversion temperature (PIT) emulsification using amphiphilic comb-like block polymers, polystyrene-b-poly[oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PSt(n)-b-POEGMA(m)-Cl). PSt(n)-b-POEGMA(m)-Cl block polymers were synthesized by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of St and OEGMA. The interfacial properties of PSt(n)-b-POEGMA(m)-Cl in aqueous media were investigated by means of surface tension measurement, fluorescence probe technique, and transmittance measurement. The length of hydrophobic PSt block chain was found to affect the critical micelle concentration, the micelle aggregation number, and the cloud point. O/W emulsions were obtained through the PIT process using PSt(n)-b-POEGMA(m)-Cl as a surfactant by lowering the temperature of emulsions below the PIT in an ice bath. PSt particles with precisely controlled size in a range between 30 and 120nm were successfully prepared by a free radical polymerization of St droplets initiated by the water- or oil-soluble initiators. FE-SEM observation revealed that the morphology of polystyrene particles was found to depend on the relative PSt chain length of PSt(n)-b-POEGMA(m)-Cl. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Chaotic encryption of images in the fractional Fourier transform domain
   using different modes of operation
SO SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
AB This paper presents an implementation of 2D chaotic Baker map using different modes of operation in the fractional Fourier transform domain on digital images. The proposed image cryptosystem implements the chaotic Baker map scrambling using three different modes of operation: cipher block chain, cipher feedback, and output feedback, in which the initialization vector works as the main key. We examine its implementation for digital images along with its detailed security analysis. The security analysis includes the statistical analysis, the histogram analysis, the correlation coefficient metric, the maximum deviation metric, the irregular deviation metric, the noise immunity, the processing time, and the key space analysis. Experimental results verify and prove that the proposed image cryptosystem is highly secure from the cryptographic viewpoint, more immune to noise, has high key sensitivity, and takes less processing time.

AB In this paper, we discuss the method of Bayesian regression and its efficacy for predicting price variation of Bitcoin, a recently popularized virtual, cryptographic currency. Bayesian regression refers to utilizing empirical data as proxy to perform Bayesian inference. We utilize Bayesian regression for the so-called "latent source model". The Bayesian regression for "latent source model" was introduced and discussed by Chen, Nikolov and Shah [1] and Bresler, Chen and Shah [2] for the purpose of binary classification. They established theoretical as well as empirical efficacy of the method for the setting of binary classification.
   In this paper, instead we utilize it for predicting real-valued quantity, the price of Bitcoin. Based on this price prediction method, we devise a simple strategy for trading Bitcoin. The strategy is able to nearly double the investment in less than 60 day period when run against real data trace.

While this level of anonymity is valued by the Bitcoin community, as Bitcoin moves toward greater adoption there will be pressure from buyers who wish to know more about who they are doing business with, and sellers who consider their reputation a strong selling point, to allow greater transparency. We consider three different models by which a reputation/rating system could be implemented in conjunction with Bitcoin transactions and consider pros and cons of each. We find that each presents challenges on both the technological and social fronts.

TI Enzyme-catalyzed preparation of dimeric acid polyester polyol from
   biodiesel and its further use in the synthesis of polyurethane
SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Biomass-based new materials have attracted wide attention due to their renewable characteristics. In this study, the synthesis of dimeric acid polyester polyol (DAPP) was conducted through the polymerization of dimeric acid methyl ester (DAME) and ethylene glycol (EG) using Novozym 435 as a catalyst. DAME was synthesized from Chinese tallow kernel oil biodiesel and purified via molecular distillation. To examine the effects of different parameters on the polymerization reaction, both single factorial experiments and response surface methodology (RSM) were employed. The optimized conditions were a Novozym 435 dosage of 2.9% (w/w), reaction temperature of 70 degrees C, molar ratio of EG-DAME of 2.2 : 1.0, and reaction time of 9.7 h. The highest hydroxyl value of the obtained DAPP was 87.47 mg KOH g(-1). Its molecular weight and acid value were 1275 g mol(-1) and 0.56 mg KOH g(-1). The product was further confirmed by FTIR and NMR. Then, the synthesized DAPP was refined into polyurethane (PU) with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). The TGA analysis of the synthetic polyurethane showed good thermostability. At the initial heating stage, no volatile constituents escaped. With an increase in temperature, thermal decomposition was divided into two stages: the first stage at 240-370 degrees C and the second at 370-480 degrees C. When the temperature reached 480 degrees C, the polyurethane was completely decomposed without any residue. DSC analysis also indicated that polyurethane had good performance at lower temperatures, with a low glass transition temperature of -52 degrees C, and there was only one peak, suggesting that the polyurethane is suitable for use in the coating industry.

TI Sphingomonas kyungheensis sp nov., a bacterium with
   ginsenoside-converting activity isolated from soil of a ginseng field
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY
AB A bacterial strain THG-B283(T), which has beta-glucosidase activity, was isolated from soil of a ginseng field. Cells were Gram-reaction-negative, oxidase- and catalase-positive, aerobic, motile with one polar flagellum and rod-shaped. The strain was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Strain THG-B283(T) grew optimally at around pH 7.0, at 25-28 degrees C and in the absence of NaCl on R2A agar. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain THG-B283(T) belongs to the family Sphingomonadaceae and is closely related to Sphingomonas melonis DAPP-PG 224(T) (98.2 %), S. aquatilis JSS7(T) (98.1 %), S. insulae DS-28(T) (97.6 %), S. mali IFO 15500(T) (97.1 %) and S. pruni IFO 15498(T) (97.0 %). Strain THG-B283(T) contained Q-10 as the predominant ubiquinone. The major fatty acids included summed feature 3 (comprising C-16:1 omega 7c and/or C-16:1 omega 6c), C-18:1 omega 7c, C-14:0 2-OH and C-16:0. The DNA G + C content was 72.2 mol%. The major component in the polyamine pattern was sym-homospermidine. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, sphingoglycolipid, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified glycolipid, unidentified aminolipids, an unidentified phospholipid and unidentified lipids. Genomic and chemotaxonomic data supported the affiliation of strain THG-B283(T) to the genus Sphingomonas. DNA-DNA relatedness between strain THG-B283(T) and its closest phylogenetic neighbours was below 23 %. On the basis of phenotypic, phylogenetic and genetic data, strain THG-B283(T) represents a novel species of genus Sphingomonas, for which the name Sphingomonas kyungheensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is THG-B283(T) (=KACC 16224(T)=LMG 26582(T)).

TI Decentralized application of anaerobic digesters in small poultry farms:
   Performance analysis of high rate self mixed anaerobic digester and
   conventional fixed dome anaerobic digester
SO BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY
AB Biomethanation of poultry litter was studied in conventional fixed dome anaerobic digester (CFDAD) and high rate self mixed anaerobic digester (SMAD) for possible decentralized application in poultry farms generating litter in the range of 500 kg/day. The performance of CFDAD and SMAD was compared. The study revealed that optimized hydraulic residence time (HRT), volatile solids (VS) loading rate, VS reduction, methane yield was 24 days, 4.0 kg VS/m(3)/day, 64%, 0.15 m(3)/(kg VS fed) and 40 days, 2.15 kg/m(3)/day, 42%, 0.083 m(3)/(kg VS fed) for SMAD and CFDAD, respectively. Better results with SMAD could be attributed to specific design features and intermittent mixing of the digester contents due to self-mixing mechanism. Preliminary cost estimates revealed that installation of SMAD would be remunerative for the farmer in terms of biogas and bio-manure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS
AB Ab-initio calculations are performed for antisites, atomic swaps and vacancies point defects in Co2CrAl Hensler alloy. Five defects, namely Cr-Co, Cr-Al, Al-Co antisites as well as Co-Cr and Cr-Al swap defects exhibit negative formation energies so they may spontaneously occur during the Co2CrAl growth. However, Co-Cr antisite and Co-Al swap and Cr, Al vacancies defects are unlikely to occur due to their high formation energies. The rest of the defects Al-Cr and Co-Al antisites and Co vacancy defects are very likely to be formed because of the small defect formation energies. The half metallicity is destroyed in the case of Co-Cr and Co-Al antisites as well as Co-Cr and Co-Al swap defects, whereas, the remaining defects retained the half metallicity with band gaps lower than the perfect case.

TI Effects of amphiphilic block copolymers on the equilibrium lactone
   fractions of camptothecin analogues at different pHs
SO BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE
AB Camptothecin (CPT) and its analogues constitute one of the most important families of anticancer drugs. However, the CPT-family members have to confront the severe problem of hydrolysis from lactone form, the only form capable of antitumor efficacy, to the carboxylate form, leading to a significant decrease in therapy efficiency as well as severe side effects. Herein, two CPT analogues with different water solubilities, 10-hydrocamptothecin (HCPT) and topotecan (TPT), and four poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(propylene glycol)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-PPG-PEG, Pluronic) copolymers of varied hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values, were examined with emphasis on the change of the equilibrium lactone fraction (f(lactone)) of the drugs after addition of the copolymers. In all cases, f(lactone) was enhanced. For weak water-soluble HCPT, the enhancement extent was significantly increased with decrease of the copolymer HLB, which is influenced by the block chain length for a given series of amphiphilic block copolymers. The effect was less significant for TPT, a more hydrophilic drug. The fluorescence experiments confirmed the assembly of the drugs into polymeric micelles. A series of pH titrations were also carried out, which quantified the shift of pH(1/2) (pH when f(lactone) = 0.5) after addition of the copolymers. The optimal or most sensitive pH, pH(opt), which gave the maximum enhancement of f(lactone) by the polymers, was found to depend upon the type of drug, the HLB value of copolymer, and also the polymer concentration. Hence, this work has indicated the universality of the enhancement effect of polymeric micelles on the equilibrium lactone fractions of CPT analogues, and meanwhile revealed the dependence of the enhancement extent upon the HLB values of the copolymer and hydrophilicity of the drug. The concept of optimal pH has also been put forward for the first time.

TI Processing of facial expressions of emotions in healthy volunteers: An
   exploration with event-related potentials and personality traits
SO NEUROPHYSIOLOGIE CLINIQUE-CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
AB Aims of the study. - Previous studies have shown that event-related potentials (ERPs) are modulated by anxiety or psychopathic personality traits. Therefore, we hypothesized that the automatic processing of facial expressions of emotions (FEE) is also correlated with related disordered personality traits.
   Methods. - Thirty-seven healthy volunteers underwent both an "oddball" ERP recording to facial expressions of Anger, Happiness, Sadness, and Neutral, and a test of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP).
   Results. - Mean reaction time was longer in response to anger than to other facial expressions. Facial expressions of Anger, Happiness and Sadness did not affect N1 (N170). By contrast, Happiness elicited a delayed P2, Anger elicited both a smaller N2 and a delayed P3b, and both Happiness and Anger elicited a P3b of higher amplitude. In addition, P3a latencies to Happiness were negatively correlated with DAPP Identity problems, and P3b latencies to Happiness were negatively correlated with DAPP Stimulus seeking, Callousness, Passive aggressivity, and Narcissism.
   Conclusion. - Our study demonstrates that Anger implicitly captures attentional resources, and Happiness triggers more facilitated processing in individuals with dissocial traits. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TI Diffusion of bacteriophages through artificial biofilm models
SO BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS
AB The simple two-chamber diffusion method was improved to study the diffusion properties of bacteriophage (phage) T4 through a model biofilm agarose gel membrane (AGM) embedded with dead host Escherichia coli K12 cells. The apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of phage T4 was calculated to be 2.4 X 10-12 m2/s in 0.5% AGM, which was lower than the coefficient of 4.2 X 10-12 m2/s in 0.5% AGM without host cells. The phage adsorption process by dead host cells slowed the apparent phage diffusion. The Langmuir adsorption equation was used to simulate phage adsorption under different multiplicity of infections (MOIs); the maximum adsorbed phage MOI was calculated to be 417 PFU/CFU, and the Langmuir adsorption constant KL was 6.9 X 10-4 CFU/PFU. To evaluate the effects of phage proliferation on diffusion, a simple syringe-based biofilm model was developed. The phage was added into this homogenous biofilm model when the host cells were in an exponential growth phase, and the apparent diffusion coefficient was greatly enhanced. We concluded that Dapp of phages through biofilms could be distinctly affected by phage adsorption and proliferation, and that the idea of Dapp and these methods can be used to study diffusion properties through real biofilms.

TI Spatial Glass Transition Temperature Variations in Polymer Glass:
   Application to a Maltodextrin-Water System
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB A model was developed to predict spatial glass transition temperature (T-g) distributions in glassy maltodextrin particles during transient moisture sorption. The simulation employed a numerical mass transfer model with a concentration dependent apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) measured using Dynamic Vapor Sorption. The mass average moisture content increase and the associated decrease in T-g were successfully modeled over time. Large spatial T-g variations were predicted in the particle, resulting in a temporary broadening of the T-g region. Temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry confirmed that the variation in T-g in nonequilibrated samples was larger than in equilibrated samples. This experimental broadening was characterized by an almost doubling of the T-g breadth compared to the start of the experiment. Upon reaching equilibrium, both the experimental and predicted T-g breadth contracted back to their initial value.

TI Drosophila Cand1 regulates Cullin3-dependent E3 ligases by affecting the
   neddylation of Cullin3 and by controlling the stability of Cullin3 and
   adaptor protein
SO DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
AB Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs), which comprise the largest class of E3 ligases, regulate diverse cellular processes by targeting numerous proteins. Conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 with Cullin activates CRLs. Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (Cand1) is known to negatively regulate CRL activity by sequestering unneddylated Cullin1 (Cul1) in biochemical studies. However, genetic studies of Arabidopsis have shown that Cand1 is required for optimal CRL activity. To elucidate the regulation of CRLs by Cand1, we analyzed a Cand1 mutant in Drosophila. Loss of Cand1 causes accumulation of neddylated Cullin3 (Cul3) and stabilizes the Cul3 adaptor protein HIB. In addition, the Cand1 mutation stimulates protein degradation of Cubitus interruptus (Ci), suggesting that CuI3-RING ligase activity is enhanced by the loss of Cand1. However, the loss of Cand1 fails to repress the accumulation of Ci in Nedd8(AN015) or CSN5(null) mutant clones. Although Cand1 is able to bind both Cull and Cul3, mutation of Cand1 suppresses only the accumulation of Cul3 induced by the dAPP-BP1 mutation defective in the neddylation pathway, and this effect is attenuated by inhibition of proteasome function. Furthermore, overexpression of Cand1 stabilizes the Cu13 protein when the neddylation pathway is partially suppressed. These data indicate that Cand1 stabilizes unneddylated Cul3 by preventing proteasomal degradation. Here, we propose that binding of Cand1 to unneddylated Cu13 causes a shift in the equilibrium away from the neddylation of Cu13 that is required for the degradation of substrate by CRLs, and protects unneddylated Cul3 from proteasomal degradation. Cand1 regulates Cul3-mediated E3 ligase activity not only by acting on the neddylation of Cu13, but also by controlling the stability of the adaptor protein and unneddylated Cul3.

TI Based blockchain-PSO-AES techniques in finger vein biometrics: A novel
   verification secure framework for patient authentication
SO COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES
AB The main objective of this study is to propose a novel verification secure framework for patient authentication between an access point (patient enrolment device) and a node database. For this purpose, two stages are used. Firstly, we propose a new hybrid biometric pattern model based on a merge algorithm to combine radio frequency identification and finger vein (FV) biometric features to increase the randomisation and security levels in pattern structure. Secondly, we developed a combination of encryption, blockchain and steganography techniques for the hybrid pattern model. When sending the pattern from an enrolment device (access point) to the node database, this process ensures that the FV biometric verification system remains secure during authentication by meeting the information security standard requirements of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Blockchain is used to achieve data integrity and availability. Particle swarm optimisation steganography and advanced encryption standard techniques are used for confidentiality in a transmission channel. Then, we discussed how the proposed framework can be implemented on a decentralised network architecture, including access point and various databases node without a central point. The proposed framework was evaluated by 106 samples chosen from a dataset that comprises 6000 samples of FV images. Results showed that (1) high-resistance verification framework is protected against spoofing and brute-force attacks; most biometric verification systems are vulnerable to such attacks. (2) The proposed framework had an advantage over the benchmark with a percentage of 55.56% in securing biometric templates during data transmission between the enrolment device and the node database.

SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Data in cloud has always been a point of attraction for the cyber attackers. Nowadays healthcare data in cloud has become their new interest. Attacks on these healthcare data can result in annihilating consequences for the healthcare organizations. Decentralization of these cloud data can minimize the effect of attacks. Storing and running computation on sensitive private healthcare data in cloud are possible by decentralization which is enabled by peer to peer (P2P) network. By leveraging the decentralized or distributed property, blockchain technology ensures the accountability and integrity. Different solutions have been proposed to control the effect of attacks using decentralized approach but these solutions somehow failed to ensure overall privacy of patient centric systems. In this paper, we present a patient centric healthcare data management system using blockchain technology as storage which helps to attain privacy. Cryptographic functions are used to encrypt patient's data and to ensure pseudonymity. We analyze the data processing procedures and also the cost effectiveness of the smart contracts used in our system. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI The Security of Big Data in Fog-Enabled IoT Applications Including
   Blockchain: A Survey
SO SENSORS
AB The proliferation of inter-connected devices in critical industries, such as healthcare and power grid, is changing the perception of what constitutes critical infrastructure. The rising interconnectedness of new critical industries is driven by the growing demand for seamless access to information as the world becomes more mobile and connected and as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows. Critical industries are essential to the foundation of today's society, and interruption of service in any of these sectors can reverberate through other sectors and even around the globe. In today's hyper-connected world, the critical infrastructure is more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats, whether state sponsored, criminal groups or individuals. As the number of interconnected devices increases, the number of potential access points for hackers to disrupt critical infrastructure grows. This new attack surface emerges from fundamental changes in the critical infrastructure of organizations technology systems. This paper aims to improve understanding the challenges to secure future digital infrastructure while it is still evolving. After introducing the infrastructure generating big data, the functionality-based fog architecture is defined. In addition, a comprehensive review of security requirements in fog-enabled IoT systems is presented. Then, an in-depth analysis of the fog computing security challenges and big data privacy and trust concerns in relation to fog-enabled IoT are given. We also discuss blockchain as a key enabler to address many security related issues in IoT and consider closely the complementary interrelationships between blockchain and fog computing. In this context, this work formalizes the task of securing big data and its scope, provides a taxonomy to categories threats to fog-based IoT systems, presents a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art contributions in the field according to their security service and recommends promising research directions for future investigations.

During the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the advancement and application of various types of ML models for energy systems. This paper presents the state of the art of ML models used in energy systems along with a novel taxonomy of models and applications. Through a novel methodology, ML models are identified and further classified according to the ML modeling technique, energy type, and application area. Furthermore, a comprehensive review of the literature leads to an assessment and performance evaluation of the ML models and their applications, and a discussion of the major challenges and opportunities for prospective research. This paper further concludes that there is an outstanding rise in the accuracy, robustness, precision and generalization ability of the ML models in energy systems using hybrid ML models. Hybridization is reported to be effective in the advancement of prediction models, particularly for renewable energy systems, e.g., solar energy, wind energy, and biofuels. Moreover, the energy demand prediction using hybrid models of ML have highly contributed to the energy efficiency and therefore energy governance and sustainability.

   systematic literature review and research agenda
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper aims to investigate the way in which blockchain technology is likely to influence future supply chain practices and policies. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of both academic and practitioner literature was conducted. Multiple accounts of blockchain adoption within industry were also consulted to gain further insight. Findings While blockchain technologies remain in their infancy, they are gaining momentum within supply chains, trust being the predominant factor driving their adoption. The value of such technologies for supply chain management lies in four areas: extended visibility and traceability, supply chain digitalisation and disintermediation, improved data security and smart contracts. Several challenges and gaps in understanding and opportunities for further research are identified by this research. How a blockchain-enabled supply chain should be configured has also been explored from a design perspective.
   Research limitations/implications - This systematic review focuses on the diffusion of blockchain technology within supply chains, and great care was taken in selecting search terms. However, the authors acknowledge that their choice of terms may have excluded certain blockchain articles from this review.
   Practical implications - This paper offers valuable insight for supply chain practitioners into how blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt existing supply chain provisions as well as a number of challenges to its successful diffusion.
   Social implications - The paper debates the poential social and economic impact brought by blockchain.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the first studies to examine the current state of blockchain diffusion within supply chains. It lays a firm foundation for future research.

TI Effects of the geopolitical risks on Bitcoin returns and volatility
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB This paper investigates the predictive power of global geopolitical risks (GPR) index on daily returns and price volatility of Bitcoin over the period July 18, 2010-May 31, 2018. Considering Bayesian Graphical Structural Vector Autoregressive (BSGVAR) technique, we find that GPR has a predictive power on both returns and volatility of Bitcoin. The results of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimations show that price volatility and returns of Bitcoin are positively and negatively related to the GPR, respectively. However, findings from the Quantile-on-Quantile (QQ) estimations state that the effects are positive at the higher quantiles of both the GPR as well as the price volatility and the returns of Bitcoin. Therefore, we conclude that Bitcoin can be considered as a hedging tool against global geopolitical risks.

SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW
AB This paper provides an analysis of how concepts pertinent to legal contracts can influence certain aspects of their digital implementation through smart contracts, as inspired by recent developments in distributed ledger technology. We discuss how properties of imperative and declarative languages including the underlying architectures to support contract management and lifecycle apply to various aspects of legal contracts. We then address these properties in the context of several blockchain architectures. While imperative languages are commonly used to implement smart contracts, we find that declarative languages provide more natural ways to deal with certain aspects of legal contracts and their automated management.

TI Smart contract applications within blockchain technology: A systematic
   mapping study
SO TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB With the advent of blockchain, smart contracts have become one of the most sought-after technologies because of the high customisability they add to transactions. This has given rise to many smart contract applications in areas ranging from financial services, life sciences and healthcare to energy resources and voting. However, due to their infancy, smart contracts still pose many challenges that encumber the stakeholders who interact with them: users, developers and the organisations that are built on top of smart contracts. This study aims to contribute to the body of knowledge of smart contracts within blockchain technology. Based on a systematic mapping study, we offer a broad perspective on their problems and corresponding solutions, present the research trends within the area and compile the 64 papers identified, grouped by top publication sources, channels, methods and approaches. We conclude that, since 2016, there has been an increasing trend towards the publication of blockchain-based smart contract articles at conferences and journals, mainly reflecting experiments and presenting methods, tools and models. According to the results, the most commonly discussed problems and solutions in the literature are related to the security, privacy and scalability of blockchain and the programmability of smart contracts.

TI Bayesian change point analysis of Bitcoin returns
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This paper studies existence of structural breaks in the average return and volatility of the Bitcoin price. We utilize a Bayesian change point model to detect structural breaks and to partition the time series into segments. We find that structural breaks in average returns and volatility of Bitcoin are very frequent. By merging segments with similar properties into regimes we identify several regimes with positive average returns and one regime with negative average returns. Across regimes, higher volatility is associated with higher average returns, with exception of the most volatile regime, which is the only regime with negative average returns.

TI Bitcoin technical trading with artificial neural network
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB This paper explores Bitcoin intraday technical trading based on artificial neural networks for the return prediction. In particular, our deep learning method successfully discovers trading signals through a seven layered neural network structure for given input data of technical indicators, which are calculated by the past time-series data over every 15 min. Under feasible settings of execution costs, the numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of a buy-and-hold strategy. Especially, our model performs well for a challenging period from December 2017 to January 2018, during which Bitcoin suffers from substantial minus returns. Furthermore, various sensitivity analysis is implemented for the change of the number of layers, activation functions, input data and output classification to confirm the robustness of our approach.

TI A Blockchain Implementation Prototype for the Electronic Open Source
   Traceability of Wood along the Whole Supply Chain
SO SENSORS
AB This is the first work to introduce the use of blockchain technology for the electronic traceability of wood from standing tree to final user. Infotracing integrates the information related to the product quality with those related to the traceability [physical and digital documents (Radio Frequency IDentification-RFID-architecture)] within an online information system whose steps (transactions) can be made safe to evidence of alteration through the blockchain. This is a decentralized and distributed ledger that keeps records of digital transactions in such a way that makes them accessible and visible to multiple participants in a network while keeping them secure without the need of a centralized certification organism. This work implements a blockchain architecture within the wood chain electronic traceability. The infotracing system is based on RFID sensors and open source technology. The entire forest wood supply chain was simulated from standing trees to the final product passing through tree cutting and sawmill process. Different kinds of Internet of Things (IoT) open source devices and tags were used, and a specific app aiming the forest operations was engineered to collect and store in a centralized database information (e.g., species, date, position, dendrometric and commercial information).

TI Strategic adaptation pathway planning to manage sea-level rise and
   changing coastal flood risk
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Communities around the world are already committed to future sea-level rise. Long-term adaptation planning to manage associated coastal flood impacts is, however, challenged by uncertainty and contested stakeholder priorities. This study provides a proof of concept for a combined robust decision making (RDM) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) approach in coastal flood risk management. The concept uses model-based support and largely open source tools to help local government plan coastal adaptation pathways. Key steps in the method are illustrated using a hypothetical case study in Australia. The study shows how scenario discovery can provide multi-dimensional descriptions of adaptation tipping points which may inform the development of technical signpost indicators. Transient scenarios uncovered limitations in seemingly robust adaptation policies, where historical path dependencies may constrain the rate of adaptation and the extent to which future coastal flood impacts can be successfully managed. Lived values have the potential to offer insights about non-material social trade-offs that residents may need to accept for the benefit of reduced flood risk, and could form a basis for defining socially-oriented signpost indicators. However, the nuances and subjectivity of lived values means that ongoing engagement with residents is essential as part of a combined RDM and DAPP approach to preserve the communities' way of life. The learnings from this hypothetical case study suggest that testing in a real world participatory setting could be valuable in further developing a combined RDM and DAPP approach to plan adaptation pathways and manage future coastal flood risk.

TI BlendCAC: A Smart Contract Enabled Decentralized Capability-Based Access
   Control Mechanism for the IoT
SO COMPUTERS
AB While Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely recognized as an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new challenges in terms of privacy and security. Access control (AC) is among the top security concerns, which is critical in resource and information protection over IoT devices. Traditional access control approaches, like Access Control Lists (ACL), Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), are not able to provide a scalable, manageable and efficient mechanism to meet the requirements of IoT systems. Another weakness in today's AC is the centralized authorization server, which can cause a performance bottleneck or be the single point of failure. Inspired by the smart contract on top of a blockchain protocol, this paper proposes BlendCAC, which is a decentralized, federated capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services and information in large-scale IoT systems. A federated capability-based delegation model (FCDM) is introduced to support hierarchical and multi-hop delegation. The mechanism for delegate authorization and revocation is explored. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry PI nodes) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops) and tested on a local private blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight and fine-grained AC solution for IoT systems.

TI A Study on the Improvement of Smart Grid Security Performance and
   Blockchain Smart Grid Perspective
SO ENERGIES
AB Interest in green energy has increased worldwide. Therefore, smart grid projects to form a more efficient and eco-friendly intelligent grid by combining information technology (IT) technology with the existing grid are actively being conducted. In Korea, a national-level smart grid project road map has been confirmed, and an action plan has been prepared. Despite such actions, there may appear various threat scenarios in the application of the IT to the grid as a reverse function. Security technology is a measure to respond to such threats effectively. The security technology of a smart grid is an important factor that is directly related to the success or failure of the smart grid project. A smart grid is a new type of next-generation grid born of the fusion with IT. If the smart grid, the backbone of the power supply, is damaged by a cyberattack, it may cause huge damage, such as a nationwide power outage. In fact, there is an increasing cyberattack threat, and the cyber security threat to the smart grid is not insignificant. Furthermore, the legal system related to information protection is also important in order to support it systematically. In this paper, the necessity of the smart grid is examined, and the industry's initiative toward the smart grid security threat and threat response is examined. In this paper, we also suggest a security plan of applying Rainbowchain, the Blockchain technology, to the smart grid and energy exchange. We propose achieving superior performance and security functions by using Rainbowchain, which contains seven authentication techniques among existing Blockchain technologies, and propose the ecosystem and architecture necessary for its application.

TI Credit Evaluation System Based on Blockchain for Multiple Stakeholders
   in the Food Supply Chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB The food supply chain is a complex system that involves a multitude of stakeholders such as farmers, production factories, distributors, retailers and consumers. Information asymmetry between stakeholders is one of the major factors that lead to food fraud. Some current researches have shown that applying blockchain can help ensure food safety. However, they tend to study the traceability of food but not its supervision. This paper provides a blockchain-based credit evaluation system to strengthen the effectiveness of supervision and management in the food supply chain. The system gathers credit evaluation text from traders by smart contracts on the blockchain. Then the gathered text is analyzed directly by a deep learning network named Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Finally traders' credit results are used as a reference for the supervision and management of regulators. By applying blockchain, traders can be held accountable for their actions in the process of transaction and credit evaluation. Regulators can gather more reliable, authentic and sufficient information about traders. The results of experiments show that adopting LSTM results in better performance than traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Navie Bayes (NB) to analyze the credit evaluation text. The system provides a friendly interface for the convenience of users.

TI Testing for multiple bubbles in bitcoin markets: A generalized sup ADF
   test
SO JAPAN AND THE WORLD ECONOMY
AB This study investigates whether bubbles exist in Bitcoin markets and tracks when they will occur and collapse. We apply the generalized sup Augmented Dickey-Fuller test method proposed by Phillips et al. (2013). The results show that there have been four explosive bubbles in China and the U.S. market, primarily occurring during the periods of huge surges in Bitcoin prices. This is consistent with the bubble model improved by Gurkaynak (2008), in which asset price is decomposed into fundamental and bubble components. In particular, exogenous shocks, including foreign or domestic economic events, lead to the origination of bubbles. A serious financial crisis may trigger long-term and large-scale bubbles, whereas relatively short-term bubbles are caused by domestic components. It can be inferred that Bitcoin can be used as a hedge against market-specific risk. Finally, Bitcoin bubbles collapse due to administrative intervention by economic authorities. Therefore, the government should manage public expectations to maintain confidence in authority and reduce speculation behavior to stabilize the asset price and financial market.

TI Smart-toy-edge-computing-oriented data exchange based on blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
AB Smart toy is a specific IoT (Internet of Things) device, and its market demand is growing dramatically. Combined with edge computing technology, smart toy can generate valuable data. Smart toy data exchange is a new powerful area. However, there is no efficient, secure and reliable data exchange mechanism among isolated smart toy data platforms and other IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a smart-toy-edge-computing-oriented data exchange prototype using Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. We target to solve the issue of automatically maintaining a tamper-resistant, reliable and distributed ledger by writing smart contract in the environment where the participants are distrustful of each other. This prototype can simplify the process, save resources and ensure a fair solution of dispute. This method also facilitates the implementation of P2P data exchange among the isolated smart toy and other IoT systems.

TI Cryptocurrency price drivers: Wavelet coherence analysis revisited
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cryptocurrencies have experienced recent surges in interest and price. It has been discovered that there are time intervals where cryptocurrency prices and certain online and social media factors appear related. In addition it has been noted that cryptocurrencies are prone to experience intervals of bubble-like price growth. The hypothesis investigated here is that relationships between online factors and price are dependent on market regime. In this paper, wavelet coherence is used to study co-movement between a cryptocurrency price and its related factors, for a number of examples. This is used alongside a well-known test for financial asset bubbles to explore whether relationships change dependent on regime. The primary finding of this work is that medium-term positive correlations between online factors and price strengthen significantly during bubble-like regimes of the price series; this explains why these relationships have previously been seen to appear and disappear over time. A secondary finding is that short-term relationships between the chosen factors and price appear to be caused by particular market events (such as hacks / security breaches), and are not consistent from one time interval to another in the effect of the factor upon the price. In addition, for the first time, wavelet coherence is used to explore the relationships between different cryptocurrencies.

TI Decentralized Applications: The Blockchain-Empowered Software System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology has attracted tremendous attention in both academia and capital market. However, overwhelming speculations on thousands of available cryptocurrencies and numerous initial coin offering scams have also brought notorious debates on this emerging technology. This paper traces the development of blockchain systems to reveal the importance of decentralized applications (dApps) and the future value of blockchain. We survey the state-of-the-art dApps and discuss the direction of blockchain development to fulfill the desirable characteristics of dApps. The readers will gain an overview of dApp research and get familiar with recent developments in the blockchain.

Many projects have been developed to realise a standard health data format to share information on a regional, national or EU level. All the projects favour and contribute to the development and improvement of the prerequisites for intra- and cross-border patient mobility. This work presents a new approach for the implementation of disruptive logging: an audit mechanism for cross-border exchange of eHealth data on OpenNCP, providing traceability and liability support within the OpenNCP infrastructure. Relevant parties could be legally obliged to keep a log of all privacy-critical operations performed by OpenNCP users.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to measure the interaction between media sentiment and the Bitcoin price. Because some researchers argued that the Bitcoin value is also determined by perception of users and investors, this paper examines how.
   Design/methodology/approach The database of relative news articles as well as blog posts has been collected for the purpose of this research. Hence, each article has been given a sentiment score depending on the negative and positive words used in the article.
   Findings This paper has identified that interaction between media sentiment and the Bitcoin price exists, and that there is a tendency for investors to overreact on news in a short period of time.
   Originality/value While sentiment analysis of Twitter posts as a predictor of the Bitcoin price has been conducted in the past, this research does not have any analog because psycho-semantic dictionaries have not been applied earlier in the Bitcoin research.

TI Incentive Mechanism of Data Storage Based on Blockchain for Wireless

SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, the blockchain technology is utilized to build the first incentive mechanism of nodes as per data storage for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In our system, the nodes storing the data are rewarded with digital money. The more the data stored by the node, the more the reward it achieves. Moreover, two blockchains are constructed. One is utilized to store data of each node and another is to control the access of data. In addition, our proposal adopts the provable data possession to replace the proof of work (PoW) in original bitcoins to carry out the mining and storage of new data blocks, which greatly reduces the computing power comparing to the PoW mechanism. Furthermore, the preserving hash functions are used to compare the stored data and the new data block. The new data can be stored in the node which is closest to the existing data, and only the different subblocks are stored. Thus, it can greatly save the storage space of network nodes.

TI Questioning Centralized Organizations in a Time of Distributed Trust
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INQUIRY
AB Imagine meeting a stranger and entering into a trusted economic exchange without needing a third party to vouch for you. What changes in your theoretical perspective in such a world? That model of interaction is what distributed trust technologies such as blockchain bring. I introduce the basic concept of distributed trust, describe some early instances, and highlight how organizational theories need to be updated to no longer rely upon fundamental assumptions about trust which are becoming outdated. Distributed trust fundamentally transforms boundaries of organizations and challenges assumptions about internalizing organizational functions to overcome market trust coordination issues. Implicit assumptions about the legitimacy and power of central network positions no longer ring true. This is very fertile ground for organizations research as the core tenet of the fieldwhat roles and functions should group together within an organizationis being called into question at the most fundamental level.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the value-at-risk and related measures for the Bitcoin and to compare the findings with Standard and Poor's SP500 Index, and the gold spot price time series.
   Design/methodology/approach A GJR-GARCH model has been implemented, in which the residuals follow the standardized Pearson type-IV distribution. A large variety of value-at-risk measures and backtesting criteria are implemented.
   Findings Bitcoin is a highly volatile currency violating the value-at-risk measures more than the other assets. With respect to the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision Accords, a Bitcoin investor is subjected to higher capital requirements and capital allocation ratio.
   Practical implications The risk of an investor holding Bitcoins is measured and quantified via the regulatory framework practices.
   Originality/value This paper is the first comprehensive approach to the risk properties of Bitcoin.

AB While swarm robotics systems are often claimed to be highly fault-tolerant, so far research has limited its attention to safe laboratory settings and has virtually ignored security issues in the presence of Byzantine robots i.e., robots with arbitrarily faulty or malicious behavior. However, in many applications one or more Byzantine robots may suffice to let current swarm coordination mechanisms fail with unpredictable or disastrous outcomes. In this paper, we provide a proof-of-concept for managing security issues in swarm robotics systems via blockchain technology. Our approach uses decentralized programs executed via blockchain technology (blockchain-based smart contracts) to establish secure swarm coordination mechanisms and to identify and exclude Byzantine swarm members. We studied the performance of our blockchain-based approach in a collective decision-making scenario both in the presence and absence of Byzantine robots and compared our results to those obtained with an existing collective decision approach. The results show a clear advantage of the blockchain approach when Byzantine robots are part of the swarm.

AB Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts - Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network and usually manipulate digital units of value. Solidity is the most mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being "The DAO", broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area.
   We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects them(1). SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more effort to complex issues.

TI With a little help from the miners: distributed ledger technology and
   market disintermediation
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to argue for the role of the blockchain, i.e., distributed ledger technology, in building innovative business models, including machine money, autonomous economic agents and decentralised organisations.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper is conceptual/argumentative. As such, it draws on research on (e-)commerce, theories of markets, disruptive innovation and extant studies and conceptual work at the intersection of cryptocurrencies, machine-to-machine commerce and the Internet of Things.
   Findings The authors highlight three application areas for blockchains, whereby they can function as applications, can help develop autonomous economic agents and can lead the development of decentralised autonomous organisations. With regards to the question of market disintermediation, the authors suggest that, rather than complete disintermediation, the most probable scenario is that of new types of intermediaries finding previously unthinkable roles to play in mediating blockchain-based economic transactions. With regards to the inhibitors that slow down the technology's adoption and, therefore, the development of new business applications, the authors posit that these relate mainly to the inherent risk of the technology, infrastructure requirements, scepticism of early decision makers and the lack of required new skills and competencies.
   Originality/value The authors examine how new forms of digital money and technologies embedding trust in decentralised networks will alter markets and commerce, at a time when many regulatory issues remain unresolved; in doing so, the authors focus on how blockchain-enabled technologies can be used to enable and further develop decentralised trusted peer-to-peer transaction ledger systems and applications and lead to sustainable business models.

CL Dublin, IRELAND
AB The paper investigates financial contract management on distributed ledgers and provides a working solution implemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The system is based on a domain-specific language for financial contracts that is capable of expressing complex multi-party derivatives and is conducive to automated execution. The authors propose an architecture for separating contractual terms from contract execution: a contract evaluator encapsulates the syntax and semantics of financial contracts without actively performing contractual actions; such actions are handled by user-definable contract managers that administer strategies for the execution of contracts. Hosting contracts and contract managers on a distributed ledger, side-by-side with digital assets, facilitates automated settlement of commitments without the need for an intermediary. The paper discusses how the proposed technology may change the way financial institutions, regulators, and individuals interact in a financial system based on distributed ledgers.

   carcinoma: Correlation between quantitative parameters and clinical
   stage
SO ONCOTARGET
AB Purpose: To evaluate the correlation between histogram parameters derived from diffusion-kurtosis (DK) imaging and the clinical stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).
   Results: High T-stage (T3/4) NPC showed significantly higher Kapp-mean (P = 0.018), Kapp-median (P = 0.029) and Kapp-90th (P = 0.003) than low T-stage (T1/2) NPC. High N-stage NPC (N2/3) showed significantly lower Dapp-mean (P = 0.002), Dapp-median (P = 0.002) and Dapp-10th (P < 0.001) than low N-stage NPC (N0/1). High AJCCstage NPC (III/IV) showed significantly lower Dapp-10th (P = 0.038) than low AJCCstage NPC (I/II). ROC analyses indicated that Kapp-90th was optimal for predicting high T-stage (AUC, 0.759; sensitivity, 0.842; specificity, 0.607), while Dapp-10th was best for predicting high N-and AJCC-stage (N-stage, AUC, 0.841; sensitivity, 0.875; specificity, 0.807; AJCC-stage, AUC, 0.671; sensitivity, 0.800; specificity, 0.588).
   Materials and Methods: DK imaging data of forty-seven consecutive NPC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Apparent diffusion for Gaussian distribution (D-app) and apparent kurtosis coefficient (K-app) were generated using diffusion-kurtosis model. Histogram parameters, including mean, median, 10th, 90th percentiles, skewness and kurtosis of D-app and K-app were calculated. Patients were divided into low and high T, N and clinical stage based on American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Differences of histogram parameters between low and high T, N and AJCC stages were compared using t test. Multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine and compare the value of significant parameters in predicting high T, N and AJCC stage, respectively.
   Conclusions: DK imaging-derived parameters correlated well with clinical stage of NPC, therefore could serve as an adjunctive imaging technique for evaluating NPC.

TI Blockchain: properties and misconceptions
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Purpose - The purpose of this article is to clarify current and widespread misconceptions about the properties of blockchain technologies and to describe challenges and avenues for correct and trustworthy design and implementation of distributed ledger system (DLS) or Technology (DLT).
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors contrast the properties of a blockchain with desired, however emergent, properties of a DLS, which is a complex and distributed system. They point out and justify, with facts and analysis, current misconceptions about the blockchain and DLSs. They describe challenges that these systems will need to address and possible solution avenues for achieving trustworthiness.
   Findings - Many of the statements that have appeared on the internet, news and academic articles, such as immutable ledger and exact copies, may bemisleading. These are desired emergent properties of a complex system, not assured properties. It is well-known within the distributed systems and critical software community that it is extremely hard to prove that a complex system correctly and completely implements emergent properties. Further research and development for trustworthy DLS design and implementation is needed, both practical and theoretical.
   Research limitations/implications - This is the first known published attempt at describing current misconceptions about blockchain technologies. Further collaborative work, discussions, potential solutions, evaluations, resulting publications and verified reference implementations are needed to ensure DLTs are safe, secure, and trustworthy.
   Practical implications - Interdisciplinary teams with members from academia, business and industry, and from disciplines such as business, entrepreneurship, theoretical and practical computer science, cybersecurity, finance, mathematics and statistics, must be formed. Such teams must collaborate with the objective of developing strategies and techniques for ensuring the correctness and security of future DLSs in which our society may become dependent.
   Originality value - The value and originality of this article is twofold: the disproving, through fact collection and systematic analysis, of current misconceptions about the properties of the blockchain and DLSs, and the discussion of challenges to achieving adequate trustworthiness along with the proposal of general avenues for possible solutions.

AB Blockchain and Internet of things are the most promising and upcoming technologies. Blockchain is a distributed, peer to peer database forming a chain between multiple blocks of data. The internet of things works on a similar paradigm where multiple devices are connected to the internet forming a network of networks. Combined together they offer solutions for various problems, especially in the field of healthcare where quick reporting of data or results is of utmost importance. Recent studies have proven that delays in providing healthcare are directly linked to patient confidence and chances of recovery. An unreliable storage of health records has only aggravated the problem. Our paper aims to provide a solution for these issues by proposing a Blockchain-Internet of things model where a bio-sensor measures and collects real time data with respect to a patient's medical status and stores it in the blockchain. In this way quick reporting and tamper proof storage of data occurs. By deploying a smart contract the final hospital bill can be calculated along with insurance coverage. This would negate the need of third party providers and create a transparent system. Our paper also proposes the use of Inter planetary file system to store discharged patients records thus reducing the load on the actual blockchain. Overall this will surely benefit patients and doctors alike by creating a safe and transparent environment along with quick response to a patient's need.

AB Within "Industrie 4.0" approach 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between "original part", "copy" or "counterfeit" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classic branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented. These are currently being developed by an 8-partner project named SAMPL (Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform).

AB This paper presents a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based Non-Linear Autoregressive with Exogeneous Inputs (NARX) Bitcoin price forecasting model using the opening, closing, minimum and maximum past prices together with Moving Average (MA) technical indicators. As there were many parameter combinations to be tested, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based method was used to optimize the number of hidden units, input lag and output lag of the NARX model. The results demonstrated the ability of the model to predict Bitcoin prices accurately while passing all model validation tests.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is envisioned to include billions of pervasive and mission-critical sensors and actuators connected to the (public) Internet. This network of smart devices is expected to generate and have access to vast amounts of information, creating unique opportunities for novel applications but, at the same time raising significant privacy and security concerns that impede its further adoption and development. In this paper, we explore the potential of a blockchain-assisted information distribution system for the IoT. We identify key security requirements of such a system and we discuss how they can be satisfied using blockchains and smart contracts. Furthermore, we present a preliminary design of the system and we identify enabling technologies.

AB Sites for online classified ads selling sex are widely used by human traffickers to support their pernicious business. The sheer quantity of ads makes manual exploration and analysis unscalable. In addition, discerning whether an ad is advertising a trafficked victim or an independent sex worker is a very difficult task. Very little concrete ground truth (i.e., ads definitively known to be posted by a trafficker) exists in this space. In this work, we develop tools and techniques that can be used separately and in conjunction to group sex ads by their true owner (and not the claimed author in the ad). Specifically, we develop a machine learning classifier that uses stylometry to distinguish between ads posted by the same vs. different authors with 90% TPR and 1% FPR. We also design a linking technique that takes advantage of leakages from the Bitcoin mempool, blockchain and sex ad site, to link a subset of sex ads to Bitcoin public wallets and transactions. Finally, we demonstrate via a 4-week proof of concept using Backpage as the sex ad site, how an analyst can use these automated approaches to potentially find human traffickers.

AB A smart contract is the formalisation of an agreement, whose terms are automatically enforced by relying on a transaction protocol, while minimising the need of intermediaries. Such contracts not only specify the service and its quality but also the possible changes at runtime of the terms of agreement. Although smart contracts provide a great deal of flexibility, analysing their compatibility and reaching agreements with this level of dynamism is considerably more challenging, due to the freedom of clients and providers in formulating needs/offers. We introduce a formal language to specify interactions between offers and requests and present a methodology for the autonomous negotiation of smart contracts, which analyses the cost and the necessary changes for reaching an agreement. Moreover, we describe a set of experiments that provides insights on the relative cost of dynamism in negotiating smart contracts and compare the request/offer matching rates of our solution with related works.

AB Blockchain has recently attracted tremendous interest due to its ability to enhance security and privacy through a immutable shared distributed ledger. Blockchain's ability to detect integrity violations are particularly key in providing assured data provenance in cloud platform. The practical adoption of blockchain will largely hinge on consensus protocols meeting performance and security guarantees. In this paper, we present the design issues for consensus protocols for blockchain based cloud provenance. We present the blockchain based data provenance framework for cloud. We find that there are performance and security challenges in adopting proof-of-work consensus protocol within this framework. We present unique design challenges and opportunities in developing proof-of-stake for data provenance in cloud platform.

AB There exist many unsolved problems in the traditional digital rights management of network media. For example, in the traditional management system it is hard to guarantee the quality of media works, to protect the copyrights, to find the effective profit model and so on. To solve these problems, we propose in this paper a network media's digital rights management scheme based on blockchain. Blockchain is a technology that makes use of cryptographic algorithm, hash chains and consensus mechanism to implement consensus, irreversibility and traceability for online data. The proposed scheme can use these functionalities of blockchain to implement the effective production management, copyright management, transaction management and users' behavior management for network media. Furthermore, our proposed scheme can predictively provide an important support for the network media platform to build a sustainable development of benign ecological environment.

TI Secure Multiparty Computations on Bitcoin
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB Is it possible to design an online protocol for playing a lottery, in a completely decentralized way, that is, without relying on a trusted third party? Or can one construct a fully decentralized protocol for selling secret information, so that neither the seller nor the buyer can cheat in it? Until recently, it seemed that every online protocol that has financial consequences for the participants needs to rely on some sort of a trusted server that ensures that the money is transferred between them. In this work, we propose to use Bitcoin (a digital currency, introduced in 2008) to design such fully decentralized protocols that are secure even if no trusted third party is available. As an instantiation of this idea, we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bitcoin currency, without relying on a trusted authority. Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example, if one party interrupts the protocol, then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it, we performed their transactions in the actual Bitcoin system) and in principle could be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites.

TI SMARTbot: A Behavioral Analysis Framework Augmented with Machine
   Learning to Identify Mobile Botnet Applications
SO PLOS ONE
AB Botnet phenomenon in smartphones is evolving with the proliferation in mobile phone technologies after leaving imperative impact on personal computers. It refers to the network of computers, laptops, mobile devices or tablets which is remotely controlled by the cybercriminals to initiate various distributed coordinated attacks including spam emails, ad-click fraud, Bitcoin mining, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), disseminating other malwares and much more. Likewise traditional PC based botnet, Mobile botnets have the same operational impact except the target audience is particular to smartphone users. Therefore, it is import to uncover this security issue prior to its widespread adaptation. We propose SMARTbot, a novel dynamic analysis framework augmented with machine learning techniques to automatically detect botnet binaries from malicious corpus. SMARTbot is a component based off-device behavioral analysis framework which can generate mobile botnet learning model by inducing Artificial Neural Networks' back-propagation method. Moreover, this framework can detect mobile botnet binaries with remarkable accuracy even in case of obfuscated program code. The results conclude that, a classifier model based on simple logistic regression outperform other machine learning classifier for botnet apps' detection, i. e 99.49% accuracy is achieved. Further, from manual inspection of botnet dataset we have extracted interesting trends in those applications. As an outcome of this research, a mobile botnet dataset is devised which will become the benchmark for future studies.

AB Several applications require robust and tamper-proof logging systems, e.g. electronic voting or bank information systems. At Scytl we use a technology, called immutable logs, that we deploy in our electronic voting solutions. This technology ensures the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of the generated logs, thus in case of any event the auditors can use them to investigate the issue. As a security recommendation it is advisable to store and/or replicate the information logged in a location where the logger has no writing or modification permissions. Otherwise, if the logger gets compromised, the data previously generated could be truncated or altered using the same private keys. This approach is costly and does not protect against collusion between the logger and the entities that hold the replicated data. In order to tackle these issues, in this article we present a proposal and implementation to immutabilize integrity proofs of the secure logs within the Bitcoin's blockchain. Due to the properties of the proposal, the integrity of the immutabilized logs is guaranteed without performing log data replication and even in case the logger gets latterly compromised.

AB Shared ledger technologies, as exemplified by Blockchain, provide a new framework for supporting business collaborations that is based on having a high-reliability, shared, trusted, privacy-preserving, nonrepudiable data repository that includes programmable logic in the form of "smart contracts". The framework has the potential to dramatically transform business collaboration across numerous industry sectors, including finance, supply chain, food production, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare. Widespread adoption of this technology will be accelerated by the development of business-level languages for specifying smart contracts. This paper proposes that data-aware business processes, and in particular the Business Artifact paradigm, can provide a robust basis for a shared ledger Business Collaboration Language (BCL). The fundamental rationale for adopting data-aware processes is that shared ledgers focus on both data and process in equal measure. The paper examines potential advantages of the artifact-based approach from two perspectives: conceptual modeling, and opportunities for formal reasoning (verification). Broad research challenges for the development, understanding, and usage of a shared ledger BCL are highlighted.

AB Blockchain is a distributed timestamp server technology introduced for realization of Bitcoin, a digital cash system. It has been attracting much attention especially in the areas of financial and legal applications. But such applications would fail if they are designed without knowledge of the fundamental differences in blockchain from existing technology.
   We show that blockchain is a probabilistic state machine in which participants can never commit on decisions; we also show that this probabilistic nature is necessarily deduced from the condition where the number of participants remains unknown. This work provides useful abstractions to think about blockchain, and raises discussion for promoting the better use of the technology.

AB The aims of this paper are to (1) provide a conceptual context for smart contracts, (2) argue that blockchains are a next-generation technology enabling much larger-scale and more complex computing projects, and (3) posit blocktime as a new mode of conceiving time. Blockchains are the distributed ledger technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; the payments layer the Internet never had; a mechanism for updating truth states in distributed network computing through consensus trust; and overall, a new form of general computational substrate. Blocktime is the time over which a certain number of blocks will have confirmed; and this creates an alternative event trajectory in time which can be offset against human-time or other computing clocktime regimes for arbitrage or complementary purposes. The result of this effort is to show that blocktime allows the contingency of future events to be more robustly orchestrated through temporality as a selectable smart contract feature.

TI A Million Metaorder Analysis of Market Impact on the Bitcoin
SO MARKET MICROSTRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY
AB We present a thorough empirical analysis of market impact on the Bitcoin/USD exchange market using a complete dataset that allows us to reconstruct more than one million metaorders. We empirically con firm the "square-root law" for market impact, which holds on four decades in spite of the quasi-absence of statistical arbitrage and market marking strategies. We show that the square-root impact holds during the whole trajectory of a metaorder and not only for the final execution price. We also attempt to decompose the order flow into an "informed" and "uninformed" component, the latter leading to an almost complete long-term decay of impact. This study sheds light on the hypotheses and predictions of several market impact models recently proposed in the literature and promotes heterogeneous agent models as promising candidates to explain price impact on the Bitcoin market - and, we believe, on other markets as well.

TI Fabrication of microvillus-like structure by photopolymerization-induced
   self-assembly of an amphiphilic random block copolymer
SO COLLOID AND POLYMER SCIENCE
AB A microvillus-like structure observed in digestive systems and glands was fabricated by the photopolymerization-induced self-assembly using an amphiphilic random block copolymer consisting of hydrophilic poly(methacrylic acid), PMAA, and hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid), P(MMA-r-MAA). The random block copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid using a PMAA end-capped with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl for the photopolymerization-induced self-assembly produced spherical vesicles and micelles during the early stage of the polymerization. These spherical particles transformed into worm-like vesicles, accompanied by the precipitation of a film-like product as the hydrophobic block chain grew according to the polymerization progress. Further extension of the hydrophobic block length produced the microvillus-like structure on the surface of the precipitating film. The finger-like structure in the microvilli had an ca. 8.5-mu m height. An inverted cone-like critical packing shape of the copolymer with the hydrophobic block longer than the hydrophilic block contributed to the formation of the microvillus-like structure.

AB Motivated by the recent success of Bitcoin we study the question of constructing distributed cryptographic protocols in a fully peer-to-peer scenario under the assumption that the adversary has limited computing power and there is no trusted setup (like PKI, or an unpredictable beacon). We propose a formal model for this scenario and then we construct a broadcast protocol in it. This protocol is secure under the assumption that the honest parties have computing power that is some non-negligible fraction of computing power of the adversary (this fraction can be small, in particular it can be much less than 1/2), and a (rough) total bound on the computing power in the system is known.
   Using our broadcast protocol we construct a protocol for simulating any trusted functionality. A simple application of the broadcast protocol is also a scheme for generating an unpredictable beacon (that can later serve, e.g., as a genesis block for a new cryptocurrency).
   Under a stronger assumption that the majority of computing power is controlled by the honest parties we construct a protocol for simulating any trusted functionality with guaranteed termination (i.e. that cannot be interrupted by the adversary). This could in principle be used as a provably-secure substitute of the blockchain technology used in the cryptocurrencies.
   Our main tool for verifying the computing power of the parties are the Proofs of Work (Dwork and Naor, CRYPTO 92). Our broadcast protocol is built on top of the classical protocol of Dolev and Strong (SIAM J. on Comp. 1983).

AB Bitcoin is an emerging crypto-currency, which is wrapped in mystery and controversy. The goal is to transform how we transfer payments. The current approach for sending money from one remote party to another is via bank deposit and transfer by check or bank transfer. PayPal and other services were developed to provide faster payments to verified individuals, but each layer in the transaction adds time, cost, and/or risk to the transaction. Users of this new digital currency proclaim the benefits of security, anonymity, and efficiency for making transactions.
   The functionality and structure of the Bitcoin Network is complex and often attacked for not being a suitable replacement for currency. An independent understanding can be developed of the composite Bitcoin Financial Systems of Systems architecture by considering the challenges any System of System would face. A functional analysis, employing the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), is performed on the Bitcoin System of Systems architecture to help gain an understanding of the structure and functionality, and how that relates to the key actors and use cases, for determining if the users' expectations are aligned with the architecture.

TI Consumption of Dried Apple Peel Powder Increases Joint Function and
   Range of Motion
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD
AB The goal for this study was to evaluate the effects of consumption of dried apple peel powder (DAPP) on joint function and range of motion (ROM). Additional in vitro and clinical testing was performed to suggest specific mechanisms of action. An open-label clinical pilot study involved 12 healthy people with moderate loss of joint ROM and associated chronic pain. The subjects consumed 4.25 g DAPP daily for 12 weeks, with evaluations at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. ROM was evaluated at each visit using dual digital inclinometry. Pain scores were collected using Visual Analogue Scales. Blood draws enabled testing of serum antioxidant protective capacity using the cellular antioxidant protection (CAP-e) bioassay. Additional in vitro testing involved testing of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and lipoxygenase inhibition, cellular antioxidant protection by the CAP-e bioassay, and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells by flow cytometry. Twelve weeks of consumption of DAPP was associated with improved ROM. DAPP provided antioxidants that were available to enter into and protect cells from oxidative damage in vitro, and consumption of DAPP for 12 weeks was associated with a statistically significant improvement in serum antioxidant protective status. DAPP inhibited both COX-2 and lipoxygenase enzymes, and pretreatment of inflammatory PMN cells with DAPP before inflammatory stimulus resulted in reduced ROS formation. This suggests multifaceted anti-inflammatory properties of DAPP. Consumption of DAPP was associated with improved joint function and improved serum antioxidant protection status. The observed pain reduction may be associated with the improved antioxidant status and linked to the apple polyphenols' anti-inflammatory effects.

TI Cooperative and selective self-assembly behaviors of diblock
   copolypeptides in nanoscale thin films
SO POLYMER CHEMISTRY
AB A series of diblock copolypeptides with various compositions (PBLG(m)-b-PBCLn) was synthesized through the living ring-opening polymerizations of gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate and epsilon-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-lysine N-carboxyanhydrides with the aid of a nickel catalyst system. They were found to be stable up to around 150 degrees C and easily processable. Their chain conformations and morphologies in nanoscale thin films were characterized in detail by using infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and in situ synchrotron grazing incidence X-ray scattering. In particular, quantitative X-ray scattering analysis was used to provide for the first time the morphological structures and orientation details of the diblock copolypeptides in thin films. Fibrils are present in the thin films of the copolypeptides; interestingly, the films are composed of two different rotationally isomeric hexagonally (HEX) packed cylinder structures that are preferentially oriented in the film plane. Further, the HEX structures consist of two substructural block units: one consisting of PBLG block chain cylinders and the other consisting of PBCL block chain cylinders. The block chains in the substructural units were found to interdigitate partially via the side groups. Thus the cylinders' interdigitation takes place selectively between block chains of the same kind rather than between different kinds of block chains. It was also confirmed that this high interdigitation selectivity occurs in the blend films of the homopolypeptides. These results show that in diblock copolypeptide films such selective interdigitation can override any thermodynamic penalties associated with the high chain rigidity due to the alpha-helical conformation and the effects of confinement in the connected diblock architecture, which leads to phase separation and the formation of well-defined, integrated HEX cylinder structures. These cooperatively and selectively formed HEX cylinder structures were found to be stable up to the degradation temperature. Molecular structure models are presented for the copolypeptide thin films as well as for the homopolypeptide blend films.

AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (p2p) electronic cash system that uses a distributed timestamp service to record transactions in a public ledger (called the Blockchain). A critical component of Bitcoin's success is the decentralized nature of its architecture, which does not require or even support the establishment of trusted authorities. Yet the absence of certification creates obstacles to its wider acceptance in e-commerce and official uses. We propose a certification system for Bitcoin that offers: a) an opt-in guarantee to send and receive bitcoins only to/from certified users; b) control of creation of bitcoins addresses (certified users) by trusted authorities. Our proposal may encourage the adoption of Bitcoin in different scenarios that require an officially recognized currency, such as tax payments-often an integral part of e-commerce transactions.

TI Effects of the expansion of doctors' offices adjacent to private
   pharmacies in Mexico: secondary data analysis of a national survey
SO BMJ OPEN
AB Objectives: To compare the sociodemographic characteristics, reasons for attending, perception of quality and associated out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures of doctors' offices adjacent to private pharmacies (DAPPs) users with users of Social Security (SS), Ministry of Health (MoH), private doctor's offices independent from pharmacies and non-users.
   Setting: Secondary data analysis of the 2012 National Survey of Health and Nutrition of Mexico.
   Participants: The study population comprised 25 852 individuals identified as having had a health problem 15 days before the survey, and a random sample of 12 799 ambulatory health service users.
   Outcome measures: Sociodemographic characteristics, reasons for attending healthcare services, perception of quality and associated OOP expenditures.
   Results: The distribution of users was as follows: DAPPs (9.2%), SS (16.1%), MoH (20.9%), private providers (15.4%) and non-users (38.5%); 65% of DAPP users were affiliated with a public institution (MoH 35%, SS 30%) and 35% reported not having health coverage. DAPP users considered the services inexpensive, convenient and with a short waiting time, yet they received >= 3 medications more often (67.2%, 95% CI 64.2% to 70.1%) than users of private doctors (55.7%, 95% CI 52.5% to 58.6%) and public institutions (SS 53.8%, 95% CI 51.6% to 55.9%; MoH 44.7%, 95% CI 42.5% to 47.0%). The probability of spending on consultations (88%, 95% CI 86% to 89%) and on medicines (97%, 95% CI 96% to 98%) was much higher for DAPP users when compared with SS (2%, 95% CI 2% to 3% and 12%, 95% CI 11% to 14%, respectively) and MoH users (11%, 95% CI 9% to 12% and 32%, 95% CI 30% to 34%, respectively).
   Conclusions: DAPPs counteract current financial protection policies since a significant percentage of their users were affiliated with a public institution, reported higher OOP spending and higher number of medicines prescribed than users of other providers. The overprescription should prompt studies to learn about DAPPs' quality of care, which may arise from the conflict of interest implicit in the linkage of prescribing and dispensing processes.

AB VERSUM allows lightweight clients to outsource expensive computations over large and frequently changing data structures, such as the Bitcoin or Namecoin blockchains, or a Certificate Transparency log. VERSUM clients ensure that the output is correct by comparing the outputs from multiple servers. VERSUM assumes that at least one server is honest, and crucially, when servers disagree, VERSUM uses an efficient conflict resolution protocol to determine which server(s) made a mistake and thus obtain the correct output.
   VERSUM's contribution lies in achieving low server-side overhead for both incremental re-computation and conflict resolution, using three key ideas: (1) representing the computation as a functional program, which allows memoization of previous results; (2) recording the evaluation trace of the functional program in a carefully designed computation history to help clients determine which server made a mistake; and (3) introducing a new authenticated data structure for sequences, called SEQHASH, that makes it efficient for servers to construct summaries of computation histories in the presence of incremental re-computation. Experimental results with an implementation of VERSUM show that VERSUM can be used for a variety of computations, that it can support many clients, and that it can easily keep up with Bitcoin's rate of new blocks with transactions.

TI 5-HT1A sex based differences in B-max, in vivo K-D, and BPND in the
   nonhuman primate
SO NEUROIMAGE
AB Serotonin (5-HT) dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric illnesses and may play a pivotal role in the differential prevalence of depression between the sexes. Previous PET studies have revealed sex-based differences in 5-HT1A binding potential (BPND). The binding potential is a function of the radioligand-receptor affinity (1/K-Dapp), and receptor density (B-max). In this work, we use a multiple-injection (MI) PET protocol and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, [F-18]mefway, to compare sex-based differences of in vivo affinity, B-max, and BPND in rhesus monkeys.
   Methods: PET [F-18]mefway studies were performed on 17 (6 m, 11f) rhesus monkeys using a 3-injection protocol that included partial saturation injections of mefway. Compaitinental modeling was performed using a model to account for non-tracer doses of mefway for the estimation of K-Dapp and B-max. BPND estimates were also acquired from the first injection (high specific activity [F-18]mefway, 90-minute duration) for comparison using the cerebellum (CB) as a reference region. Regions of interest were selected in 5-HT1A binding regions of the hippocampus (Hp), dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), amygdala (Am), and raphe nuclei (RN).
   Results: Female subjects displayed significantly (*p < 0.05) lower K-Dapp in the Hp (-32%), Am (-38%), and RN (-37%). Only the Hp displayed significant differences in B-max with females having a B-max of -29% compared to males. Male subjects demonstrated significantly lower BPND measurements in the Am (14%) and RN (29%).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that the higher BPND values found in females are the result of lower [F-18] mefway K-Dapp. Although a more experimentally complex measurement, separate assay of K-Dapp and B-max provides a more sensitive measure than BPND to identify the underlying differences between females and males in 5-HT1A function.

TI Measurement of 5-HT1A receptor density and in-vivo binding parameters of
   [F-18]mefway in the nonhuman primate
SO JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB The goal of this work was to characterize the in-vivo behavior of [F-18]mefway as a suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for the assay of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor density (B-max). Six rhesus monkeys were studied using a multiple-injection (M-I) protocol consisting of three sequential bolus injections of [F-18]mefway. Injection times and amounts of unlabeled mefway were optimized for the precise measurement of B-max and specific binding parameters k(off) and k(on) for estimation of apparent K-D. The PET time series were acquired for 180 minutes with arterial sampling performed throughout. Compartmental analysis using the arterial input function was performed to obtain estimates for K-1, k(2), k(off), B-max, and K-Dapp in the cerebral cortex and raphe nuclei (RN) using a model that accounted for nontracer doses of mefway. Averaged over subjects, highest binding was seen in the mesial temporal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices with B-max values of 42 +/- 8 and 36 +/- 8 pmol/mL, respectively, and lower values in the superior temporal cortex, RN, and parietal cortex of 24 +/- 4, 19 +/- 4, and 13 +/- 2 pmol/mL, respectively. The K-Dapp of mefway for the 5-HT1A receptor sites was 4.3 +/- 1.3 nmol/L. In conclusion, these results show that M-I [F-18]mefway PET experiments can be used for the in-vivo measurement of 5-HT1A receptor density.

TI Influence of S/B middle block composition on the morphology and the
   mechanical response of polystyrene-poly(
   styrene-co-butadiene)-polystyrene triblock copolymers
SO POLYMER
AB Polystyrene-poly(styrene-co-butadiene)-polystyrene triblock copolymers (PS-P(S-co-B)-PS) having different styrene contents (from 30 wt.% to 80 wt.%) in the statistical copolymer middle block and different block architectures (20-60-20 and 30-40-30) were characterised to study the influence of S/B middle block composition and segregation strength on the morphology and mechanical behaviour. The morphological investigations, i.e. TEM and SAXS, exhibited ordered lamellar and lamellar-like morphologies for both block architectures at low styrene contents between 30 wt.% and 50 wt.% in the S/B middle block. The increase in the styrene content in the middle block to 70 wt.% resulted in phase separated structures without long range order due to the enhanced miscibility between the PS and P(S-co-B) phase as observed from dynamic mechanical analysis. Further it was observed that the glass transition of the butadiene-rich phase is mainly determined by the S/B composition of the statistical copolymer block as confirmed by the Fox-equation. The alteration of the glass transition of the PS-rich phase and the observed PS-softening with raise in styrene content might be correlated to the increasing interphase width due to the enhanced miscibility as shown by calculations based on a simple model for diblock copolymers. Tensile testing revealed a transition from ductile to semi-ductile to brittle behaviour that strongly depends on the styrene content in the S/B middle block, chain architecture and the resulting morphology. Block copolymers (BCPs) with lamellar structure exhibited ductile behaviour with extensive strain hardening, whereas BCPs forming segregated structures without long range order were semi-ductile or brittle depending on the type of block architecture and on the hard-phase content. The transition in the mechanical behaviour was confirmed by fracture mechanical investigations based on the essential work of fracture approach and SEM-characterizations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A series of monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol (mPEG)-based branched amphiphilic copolymers of poly(dl-lactic acid) (PLA) with varying hydrophilic fraction and mPEG chain length were synthesized and used for preparing polymersomes by emulsion-diffusion-evaporation method. Effect of mPEG chain length and hydrophilic weight fraction on polymersome's particle size, protein adsorption, degradation, drug loading, and release kinetics were studied. For degradation study, polymersomes were suspended in acidic buffer at 37 degrees C where they degraded by poration followed by fragmentation and were stable at 4 degrees C and pH 7.4. Polymersomes were relatively stable with increased mPEG chain length and hydrophilic weight fraction, maintaining vesicular integrities under conditions of study. Protein adsorption studies showed a decrease in protein adsorption with increasing mPEG chain length and hydrophilic weight fraction of the copolymer. Drug loading and drug release profile of polymersomes were carried out using hydrophobic and hydrophilic dyes. The copolymers with short hydrophobic block chain have shown lower hydrophobic dye loading, while copolymers with longer hydrophobic block have shown higher hydrophobic dye loading however such trend was not observed for hydrophilic dye. The results indicated that hydrophobic dye, localized in the membrane of polymersomes, released within 2 hr while hydrophilic dye showed 25% burst release followed by sustained release till 21 days that could be attributed to thick bilayer membrane. The findings of this study have suggested that polymersomes made from such copolymers would be potential carrier systems for hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs and would be able to control and sustain the release of hydrophilic dye.

TI Blockchain Technology in Healthcare: A Systematic Review
SO HEALTHCARE
AB Since blockchain was introduced through Bitcoin, research has been ongoing to extend its applications to non-financial use cases. Healthcare is one industry in which blockchain is expected to have significant impacts. Research in this area is relatively new but growing rapidly; so, health informatics researchers and practitioners are always struggling to keep pace with research progress in this area. This paper reports on a systematic review of the ongoing research in the application of blockchain technology in healthcare. The research methodology is based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines and a systematic mapping study process, in which a well-designed search protocol is used to search four scientific databases, to identify, extract and analyze all relevant publications. The review shows that a number of studies have proposed different use cases for the application of blockchain in healthcare; however, there is a lack of adequate prototype implementations and studies to characterize the effectiveness of these proposed use cases. The review further highlights the state-of-the-art in the development of blockchain applications for healthcare, their limitations and the areas for future research. To this end, therefore, there is still the need for more research to better understand, characterize and evaluate the utility of blockchain in healthcare.

TI Regime changes in Bitcoin GARCH volatility dynamics
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We test the presence of regime changes in the GARCH volatility dynamics of Bitcoin log-returns using Markov switching GARCH (MSGARCH) models. We also compare MSGARCH to traditional single-regime GARCH specifications in predicting one-day ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR). The Bayesian approach is used to estimate the model parameters and to compute the VaR forecasts. We find strong evidence of regime changes in the GARCH process and show that MSGARCH models outperform single-regime specifications when predicting the VaR.

TI Cryptocurrency-portfolios in a mean-variance framework
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We apply the Markowitz mean-variance framework in order to assess risk-return benefits of cryptocurrency-portfolios. Using daily data of the 500 most capitalized cryptocurrencies for the time span 1/1/2015 to 12/31/2017, we relate risk and return of different mean-variance portfolio strategies to single cryptocurrency investments and two benchmarks, the naively diversified portfolio and the CRIX. In an out-of-sample analysis accounting for transaction cost we find that combining cryptocurrencies enriches the set of 'low'-risk cryptocurrency investment opportunities. In terms of the Sharpe ratio and certainty equivalent returns, the 1/N-portfolio outper-forms single cryptocurrencies and more than 75% of mean-variance optimal portfolios.

TI Are shocks on the returns and volatility of cryptocurrencies really
   persistent?
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This letter questions the true nature (true versus spurious) of the Long Range Dependence (LRD) behavior observed in the returns and volatility series of four Cryptocurrencies (CC). Using a robust approach, this letter shows that the LRD behavior exhibited by the returns and volatility series of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple is a true behavior, and not a statistical artifact. As for Ethereum, the results show that the true LRD is only supported for the volatility series. Our results confirm the inefficiency of all the considered markets, with the exception of Ethereum.

TI Incentivizing Consensus Propagation in Proof-of-Stake Based Consortium
   Blockchain Networks
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB In proof-of-stake based consortium blockchain networks, pre-selected miners compete to solve a crypto-puzzle with a successfully mining probability proportional to the amount of their stakes. When the puzzle is solved, the miners are encouraged to take part in mined block propagation for verification to win a transaction fee from the blockchain user. The mined block should be propagated over wired or wireless networks, and he verified as quickly as possible to decrease consensus propagation delay. In this letter, we study incentivizing the consensus propagation considering the tradeoff between the network delay of block propagation process and offered transaction fee from the blockchain user. A Stackelberg game is then formulated to jointly maximize utility of the blockchain user and individual profit of the miners. The blockchain user acting as the leader sets the transaction fee for block verification. The miners acting as the followers decide on the number of recruited verifiers over wired or wireless networks. We apply the backward induction to analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium. Performance evaluation validates the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed game model in consensus propagation.

TI A Study on Improvement of Blockchain Application to Overcome
   Vulnerability of IoT Multiplatform Security
SO ENERGIES
AB IoT devices are widely used in the smart home, automobile, and aerospace areas. Note, however, that recent information on thefts and hacking have given rise to many problems. The aim of this study is to overcome the security weaknesses of existing Internet of Things (IoT) devices using Blockchain technology, which is a recent issue. This technology is used in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) access paymentKYD (Know Your Device)based on the reliability of existing IoT devices. Thus, this paper proposes a BoT (Blockchain of Things) ecosystem to overcome problems related to the hacking risk of IoT devices to be introduced, such as logistics management and history management. There are also many security vulnerabilities in the sensor multi-platform from the IoT point of view. In this paper, we propose a model that solves the security vulnerability in the sensor multi-platform by using blockchain technology on an empirical model. The color spectrum chain mentioned in this paper suggests a blockchain technique completed by using the multiple-agreement algorithm to enhance Thin-Plate Spline (TPS) performance and measure various security strengths. In conclusion, we propose a radix of the blockchain's core algorithm to overcome the weaknesses of sensor devices such as automobile, airplane, and close-circuit television (CCTV) using blockchain technology. Because all IoT devices use wireless technology, they have a fundamental weakness over wired networks. Sensors are exposed to hacking and sensor multi-platforms are vulnerable to security by multiple channels. In addition, since IoT devices have a lot of security weaknesses we intend to show the authentication strength of security through the color spectrum chain and apply it to sensor and multi-platform using Blockchain in the future.

TI Analytical Model for Sybil Attack Phases in Internet of Things
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The sybil attack in Internet of Things (IoT) commonly aims the sensing domain that may impose serious threat to the devices both in perception and communication layer. The singularity of the sybil attack is a sybil node that publish multiple identities of legitimate devices. It is highly essential to learn the behavior and predict possible actions of a sybil attacker while devising a defense mechanism for it. This paper provides a comprehensive characteristic analysis of sybil attack in IoT. Based on the nature of the task performed during this attack, it is classified into three phases as compromise, deployment, and launching phase. The compromise phase is modeled as an automaton with attacker state transition as a Markov chain model. A heuristic is also proposed for selection criteria of an attacker to compromise a node. In the deployment phase of the attack, an algorithm based on K-mean clustering is proposed to group compromised identities and deploy the sybil node for corresponding identities without violating the set of adjacent nodes. In the launching phase, the process of replacing sybil identities either over time or on detection is modeled using age replacement policy. The results depict that the proposed model effectively visualize the behavior of a sybil attacker in challenging environments of IoT.

TI Survey on blockchain for Internet of Things
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to transform human life and unleash enormous economic benefit. However, inadequate data security and trust of current IoT are seriously limiting its adoption. Blockchain, a distributed and tamper-resistant ledger, maintains consistent records of data at different locations, and has the potential to address the data security concern in IoT networks. While providing data security to the IoT, Blockchain also encounters a number of critical challenges inherent in the IoT, such as a huge number of IoT devices, non-homogeneous network structure, limited computing power, low communication bandwidth, and error-prone radio links. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on existing Blockchain technologies with an emphasis on the IoT applications. The Blockchain technologies which can potentially address the critical challenges arising from the IoT and hence suit the IoT applications are identified with potential adaptations and enhancements elaborated on the Blockchain consensus protocols and data structures. Future research directions are collated for effective integration of Blockchain into the IoT networks.

TI Modelling long memory volatility in the Bitcoin market: Evidence of
   persistence and structural breaks
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE & ECONOMICS
AB Motivated by the emergence of Bitcoin as a speculative financial investment, the purpose of this paper is to examine the persistence in the level and volatility of Bitcoin price, accounting for the impact of structural breaks. Using parametric and semiparametric techniques, we find strong evidence in favour of a permanency of the shocks and lack of mean reversion in the level series. We also reveal evidence of structural changes in the dynamics of Bitcoin. After accounting for the structural breaks in the level series, evidence of mean reversion is uncovered in some cases. Further analyses show evidence of a long memory in the two measures of volatility (absolute and the squared returns), whereas some cases of short memory are revealed in the squared returns series in particular. Practical implications are discussed on the inefficiency in the Bitcoin market and its importance for Bitcoin users and investors.

TI Initial coin offerings (ICOs) to finance new ventures
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING
AB In an initial coin offering (ICO), new ventures raise capital by selling tokens to a crowd of investors. Often, this token is a cryptocurrency, a digital medium of value exchange based on the distributed ledger technology. Both the number of ICOs and the amount of capital raised have exploded since 2017. Despite attracting significant attention from ventures, investors, and policy makers, little is known about the dynamics of ICOs. This initial study therefore assesses the determinants of the amount raised in 423 ICOs. Drawing on signaling theory, the study explores the role of signaling ventures' technological capabilities in ICOs. The results show that technical white papers and high-quality source codes increase the amount raised, while patents are not associated with increased amounts of funding. Exploring further determinants of the amount raised, the results indicate that some of the underlying mechanisms in ICOs resemble those found in prior research into entrepreneurial finance, while others are unique to the ICO context. The study's implications are multifold and discussed in detail. Importantly, the results enable investors to more accurately understand crucial determinants of the amount raised (e.g., technical white papers, source code quality, token supply, Ethereum-standard). This reduces the considerable uncertainty that investors face when investing in ICOs and enables more informed decision-making.

TI Cryptocurrency forecasting with deep learning chaotic neural networks
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB We implement deep learning techniques to forecast the price of the three most widely traded digital currencies i.e., Bitcoin, Digital Cash and Ripple. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to make use of deep learning in cryptocurrency prediction. The results from testing the existence of non-linearity revealed that the time series of all digital currencies exhibit fractal dynamics, long memory and self-similarity. The predictability of long-short term memory neural network topologies (LSTM) is significantly higher when compared to the generalized regression neural architecture, set forth as our benchmark system. The latter failed to approximate global nonlinear hidden patterns regardless of the degree of contamination with noise, as they are based on Gaussian kernels suitable only for local approximation of non-stationary signals. Although the computational burden of the LSTM model is higher as opposed to brute force in nonlinear pattern recognition, eventually deep learning was found to be highly efficient in forecasting the inherent chaotic dynamics of cryptocurrency markets.

TI Distributed Resource Allocation in Blockchain-Based Video Streaming
   Systems With Mobile Edge Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
AB Blockchain-based video streaming systems aim to build decentralized peer-to-peer networks with flexible monetization mechanisms for video streaming services. On these blockchain-based platforms, video transcoding, which is computationally intensive and time-consuming, is still a major challenge. Meanwhile, the block size of the underlying blockchain has significant impacts on the system performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based framework with an adaptive block size for video streaming with mobile edge computing (MEC). First, we design an incentive mechanism to facilitate collaboration among content creators, video transcoders, and consumers. In addition, we present a block size adaptation scheme for blockchain-based video streaming. Moreover, we consider two offloading modes, i.e., offloading to the nearby MEC nodes or a group of device-to-device (D2D) users, to avoid the overload of MEC nodes. Then, we formulate the issues of resource allocation, scheduling of offloading, and adaptive block size as an optimization problem. We employ a low-complexity alternating direction method of the multipliers-based algorithm to solve the problem in a distributed fashion. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI Security Services Using Blockchains: A State of the Art Survey
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB This paper surveys blockchain-based approaches for several security services. These services include authentication, confidentiality, privacy and access control list, data and resource provenance, and integrity assurance. All these services are critical for the current distributed applications, especially due to the large amount of data being processed over the networks and the use of cloud computing. Authentication ensures that the user is who he/she claims to be. Confidentiality guarantees that data cannot be read by unauthorized users. Privacy provides the users the ability to control who can access their data. Provenance allows an efficient tracking of the data and resources along with their ownership and utilization over the network. Integrity helps in verifying that the data has not been modified or altered. These services are currently managed by centralized controllers, for example, a certificate authority. Therefore, the services are prone to attacks on the centralized controller. On the other hand, blockchain is a secured and distributed ledger that can help resolve many of the problems with centralization. The objectives of this paper are to give insights on the use of security services for current applications, to highlight the state of the art techniques that are currently used to provide these services, to describe their challenges, and to discuss how the blockchain technology can resolve these challenges. Further, several blockchain-based approaches providing such security services are compared thoroughly. Challenges associated with using blockchain-based security services are also discussed to spur further research in this area.

TI Volatility and return jumps in bitcoin
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB In this article we are interested in understanding the dynamics of Bitcoin daily returns and volatility. Cryptocurrencies have very high unconditional volatility, and are subject to sudden, massive, price swings. We start with a standard log-normal stochastic volatility model, then explore two formulations which incorporate discontinuous jumps to volatility and returns. Jumps to volatility are permanent, while jumps to mean returns have contemporaneous effects only. Results point to two high volatility periods: the first from late 2013 to early 2014, likely associated to the Mt. Gox incident; the second covers the year of 2017, peaking on December - likely driven by increased popular attention. Jumps to mean returns are specially relevant to capture large price variations, mostly negative, associated with formative events in cryptocurrency markets, such as hacks and unsuccessful fork attempts.

CT 16th Workshop on Adaptive and Reflective Middleware (ARM)
CY DEC 11-15, 2017
CL Las Vegas, NV
AB If last decade viewed computational services as a utility then surely this decade has transformed computation into a commodity. Computation is now progressively integrated into the physical networks in a seamless way that enables cyber-physical systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) meet their latency requirements. Similar to the concept of "platform as a service" or "software as a service", both cloudlets and fog computing have found their own use cases. Edge devices (that we call end or user devices for disambiguation) play the role of personal computers, dedicated to a user and to a set of correlated applications. In this new scenario, the boundaries between the network node, the sensor, and the actuator are blurring, driven primarily by the computation power of IoT nodes like single board computers and the smartphones. The bigger data generated in this type of networks needs clever, scalable, and possibly decentralized computing solutions that can scale independently as required. Any node can be seen as part of a graph, with the capacity to serve as a computing or network router node, or both. Complex applications can possibly be distributed over this graph or network of nodes to improve the overall performance like the amount of data processed over time. In this paper, we identify this new computing paradigm that we call Social Dispersed Computing, analyzing key themes in it that includes a new outlook on its relation to agent based applications. We architect this new paradigm by providing supportive application examples that include next generation electrical energy distribution networks, next generation mobility services for transportation, and applications for distributed analysis and identification of non-recurring traffic congestion in cities. The paper analyzes the existing computing paradigms (e.g., cloud, fog, edge, mobile edge, social, etc.), solving the ambiguity of their definitions; and analyzes and discusses the relevant foundational software technologies, the remaining challenges, and research opportunities.

This is more than 40 times longer than when irradiating at 10 K. Optical absorption spectroscopy, magnetometry, and X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation were used to characterize and explain the different relaxation behaviors of this compound after irradiation below and above 70 K. Rearrangement of the butyl chains of the ligands occurring during the relaxation after irradiation above 70 K is thought to be responsible for the unusually long relaxation time at this temperature.

TI Smart Contract-Based Review System for an IoT Data Marketplace
SO SENSORS
AB Internet of Things (IoT)-based devices, especially those used for home automation, consist of their own sensors and generate many logs during a process. Enterprises producing IoT devices convert these log data into more useful data through secondary processing; thus, they require data from the device users. Recently, a platform for data sharing has been developed because the demand for IoT data increases. Several IoT data marketplaces are based on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and in this type of marketplace, it is difficult for an enterprise to trust a data owner or the data they want to trade. Therefore, in this study, we propose a review system that can confirm the reputation of a data owner or the data traded in the P2P data marketplace. The traditional server-client review systems have many drawbacks, such as security vulnerability or server administrator's malicious behavior. However, the review system developed in this study is based on Ethereum smart contracts; thus, this system is running on the P2P network and is more flexible for the network problem. Moreover, the integrity and immutability of the registered reviews are assured because of the blockchain public ledger. In addition, a certain amount of gas is essential for all functions to be processed by Ethereum transactions. Accordingly, we tested and analyzed the performance of our proposed model in terms of gas required.

TI Blockchain Technology for Detecting Falsified and Substandard Drugs in
   Distribution: Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Intervention
SO JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB Background: Drug counterfeiting is a global problem with significant risks to consumers and the general public. In the Philippines, 30% of inspected drug stores in 2003 were found with substandard/spurious/falsely-labeled/falsified/counterfeit drugs. The economic burden on the population drug expenditures and on governments is high. The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) encourages the public to check the certificates of product registration and report any instances of counterfeiting. The National Police of Philippines responds to such reports through a special task force. However, no literature on its impact on the distribution of such drugs were found. Blockchain technology is a cryptographic ledger that is allegedly immutable through repeated sequential hashing and fault-tolerant through a consensus algorithm. This project will develop and test a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system that will support information sharing along the official drug distribution network.
   Objective: This study aims to develop a pharmacosurveillance blockchain system and test its functions in a simulated network.
   Methods: We are developing a Distributed Application (DApp) that will run on smart contracts, employing Swarm as the Distributed File System (DFS). Two instances will be developed: one for Ethereum and another for Hyperledger Fabric. The proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm of Ethereum will be modified into a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) or practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm as it is scalable and fits the drug supply chain environment. The system will adopt the GS1 pedigree standard and will satisfy the data points in the data standardization guidelines from the US FDA. Simulations will use the following 5 nodes: for FDA, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, and the consumer portal.
   Results: Development is underway. The design of the system will place FDA in a supervisory data verification role, with each pedigree type-specific data source serving a primary data verification role. The supply chain process will be initiated by the manufacturer, with recursive verification for every transaction. It will allow consumers to scan a code printed on the receipt of their purchases to review the drug distribution history.
   Conclusions: Development and testing will be conducted in a simulated network, and thus, results may differ from actual practice. The project being proposed is disruptive; once tested, the team intends to engage the Philippine FDA to discuss implementation plans and formulate policies to facilitate adoption and sustainability.

TI Root Exploit Detection and Features Optimization: Mobile Device and
   Blockchain Based Medical Data Management
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB The increasing demand for Android mobile devices and blockchain has motivated malware creators to develop mobile malware to compromise the blockchain. Although the blockchain is secure, attackers have managed to gain access into the blockchain as legal users, thereby comprising important and crucial information. Examples of mobile malware include root exploit, botnets, and Trojans and root exploit is one of the most dangerous malware. It compromises the operating system kernel in order to gain root privileges which are then used by attackers to bypass the security mechanisms, to gain complete control of the operating system, to install other possible types of malware to the devices, and finally, to steal victims' private keys linked to the blockchain. For the purpose of maximizing the security of the blockchain-based medical data management (BMDM), it is crucial to investigate the novel features and approaches contained in root exploit malware. This study proposes to use the bio-inspired method of practical swarm optimization (PSO) which automatically select the exclusive features that contain the novel android debug bridge (ADB). This study also adopts boosting (adaboost, realadaboost, logitboost, and multiboost) to enhance the machine learning prediction that detects unknown root exploit, and scrutinized three categories of features including (1) system command, (2) directory path and (3) code-based. The evaluation gathered from this study suggests a marked accuracy value of 93% with Logitboost in the simulation. Logitboost also helped to predicted all the root exploit samples in our developed system, the root exploit detection system (RODS).

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Motivated by the recent blockchain technology originally built for bitcoin transactions, various industries are exploring the opportunities to redefine their existing operational systems. In this study, an innovative environmentally sustainable solution is proposed for the fashion apparel manufacturing industry (FAMI), which is energized by blockchain. Incorporating the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), and a novel "emission link" system, the proposed framework exposes carbon emission to the public and establishes a feature to reduce the emissions for all key steps of clothing making. Fully compatible with Industry 4.0, blockchain provides decentralization, transparency, automation, and immutability characteristics to the proposed framework. Specifically, the blockchain supported ETS framework, the carbon emissions of clothing manufacturing life cycle, and the emission link powered procedures are introduced in detail. A case study is provided to demonstrate the carbon emission evaluation procedure. Finally, a multi-criteria evaluation is performed to demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed system.

TI National guidance for adapting to coastal hazards and sea-level rise:
   Anticipating change, when and how to change pathway
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Sea-level rise challenges public policy-making because existing planning frameworks and methods are designed to promote certainty using static and time-bound planning and legal instruments. Sea-level rise is a dynamic and uncertain process, which is deeply uncertain towards the latter part of this century and beyond. Communities require decision making approaches that can enable adjustments to policies ahead of damage, without entrenching current exposure to hazards or incurring larger than necessary adjustment costs in the future. We first discuss the nature of the sea-level problem, the policy context that creates decision-making challenges and how they have been typically addressed through policy and practice. Secondly, we show how an assessment and planning approach, designed to address uncertainty and change (the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) planning approach), has been integrated into national guidance for coastal hazard and climate change decision making in New Zealand. The Guidance integrates hazard and sea-level rise assessments with uncertainty type and with the scale and scope of activity. It is underpinned with values-based community engagement, and uses signals and decision triggers for monitoring and adjusting pathways to meet objectives over time. The applicability of the approach in the Guidance for other policy problems involving uncertainty, is also discussed.

AB Albeit the primary usage of Bitcoin is to exchange currency, its blockchain and consensus mechanism can also be exploited to securely execute some forms of smart contracts. These are agreements among mutually distrusting parties, which can be automatically enforced without resorting to a trusted intermediary. Over the last few years a variety of smart contracts for Bitcoin have been proposed, both by the academic community and by that of developers. However, the heterogeneity in their treatment, the informal (often incomplete or imprecise) descriptions, and the use of poorly documented Bitcoin features, pose obstacles to the research. In this paper we present a comprehensive survey of smart contracts on Bitcoin, in a uniform framework. Our treatment is based on a new formal specification language for smart contracts, which also helps us to highlight some subtleties in existing informal descriptions, making a step towards automatic verification. We discuss some obstacles to the diffusion of smart contracts on Bitcoin, and we identify the most promising open research challenges.

AB Solidity is a language used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are embedded procedures stored with the data they act upon. Debugging smart contracts is a really difficult task since once deployed, the code cannot be re-executed and inspecting a simple attribute is not easily possible because data is encoded. In this paper, we address the lack of inspectability of a deployed contract by analyzing contract state using decompilation techniques driven by the contract structure definition. Our solution, SmartInspect, also uses a mirror-based architecture to represent locally object responsible for the interpretation of the contract state. SmartInspect allows contract developers to better visualize and understand the contract stored state without needing to redeploy, nor develop any ad-hoc code.

AB We propose Bulletproofs, a new non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol with very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only logarithmic in the witness size. Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only 2 log(2) (n) + 9 group and field elements, where n is the bit length of the range. Proof generation and verification times are linear in n.
   Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in n) sized range proofs in existing proposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that m commitments lie in a given range by providing only an additive Oplogpmqq group elements over the length of a single proof. To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs. This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication. We show that verification time, while asymptotically linear, is very efficient in practice. The marginal cost of batch verifying 32 aggregated range proofs is less than the cost of verifying 32 ECDSA signatures. Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016). Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup. We discuss many applications that would benefit from Bulletproofs, primarily in the area of cryptocurrencies. The efficiency of Bulletproofs is particularly well suited for the distributed and trustless nature of blockchains. The full version of this article is available at [ 1].

AB According to the Taiwan Ministry of Education statistics, about one million graduates each year, some of them will go to countries, high schools or tertiary institutions to continue to attend, and some will be ready to enter the workplace employment. During the course of study, the students' all kinds of excellent performance certificates, score transcripts, diplomas, etc., will become an important reference for admitting new schools or new works. As schools make various awards or diplomas, only the names of the schools and the students are input. Due to the lack of effective anti-forge mechanism, events that cause the graduation certificate to be forged often get noticed. In order to solve the problem of counterfeiting certificates, the digital certificate system based on blockchain technology would be proposed. By the unmodifiable property of blockchain, the digital certificate with anti-counterfeit and verifiability could be made. The procedure of issuing the digital certificate in this system is as follows. First, generate the electronic file of a paper certificate accompanying other related data into the database, meanwhile calculate the electronic file for its hash value. Finally, store the hash value into the block in the chain system. The system will create a related QR-code and inquiry string code to affix to the paper certificate. It will provide the demand unit to verify the authenticity of the paper certificate through mobile phone scanning or website inquiries. Through the unmodifiable properties of the blockchain, the system not only enhances the credibility of various paper-based certificates, but also electronically reduces the loss risks of various types of certificates.

AB Privacy and safety are the most needed features while accessing the data in the IoT. Due to the complicated decentralization and heterogeneous environment present in IoT, the security and privacy of the data becomes a challenging job for the developers. The current methods are not suitable for these scenarios where a decentralized and heterogeneous system exists. This paper provides a new method for access control in IoT based on the booming technology "Block Chain," which helps the user in accessing or controlling their data. The contribution consists of a description of the model used to show how a blockchain is used for creating access control methods. To implement the method, the blockchain is taken as the decentralized access manager. The proposed method is validated with respect to the previous related work. Finally, the limitations and future work of the paper are discussed. Access Control Systems are proved to provide access control to critical resources. The right to access the resources is defined by the access control policies that are executed during the access request time.

TI Can cryptocurrencies be a safe haven: a tail risk perspective analysis
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB Cryptocurrencies are one of the most promising financial innovations of the last decade. Different from major stock indices and the commodities of gold and crude oil, the cryptocurrencies exhibit some characteristics of immature market assets, such as auto-correlated and non-stationary return series, higher volatility, and higher tail risks measured by conditional Value at Risk (VaR) and conditional expected shortfall (ES). Using an extreme-value-theory-based method, we evaluate the extreme characteristics of seven representative cryptocurrencies during 08 August 2015-01 August 2017. We find that during the sub-period of 01 August 2016-01 August 2017, there are finite loss boundaries for most of the selected cryptocurrencies, which are similar to the commodities, and different from the stock indices. Meanwhile, we find that left tail correlations are much stronger than right tail correlations among the cryptocurrencies, and tail correlations increased after August 2016, suggesting high and growing systematic extreme risks. We also find that cryptocurrencies to be both left tail independent, and cross tail independent with four selected stock indices, which implies part of the safe-haven function of the cryptocurrencies, indicating their ability to be a great diversifier for the stock market as gold, but not enough to be a tail hedging tool like gold.

TI Blockchain-Based Proof of Delivery of Physical Assets With Single and
   Multiple Transporters
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the widespread of E-commerce, the need of a trusted system to ensure the delivery of traded items is crucial. Current proof of delivery (PoD) systems lacks transparency, traceability, and credibility. These systems are mostly centralized and rely on trusted third parties (TTPs) to complete the delivery between sellers and buyers. TTPs can be costly, a single point of failure, and subject to hacking, privacy evasion, and compromise. The blockchain is an immutable, trusted, and decentralized ledger with logs and events that can be used for transparency, traceability, and tracking. In this paper, we present a solution and a general framework using the popular permissionless Ethereum blockchain to create a trusted, decentralized PoD system that ensures accountability, auditability, and integrity. The solution uses Ethereum smart contracts to prove the delivery of a shipped item between a seller and a buyer irrespective of the number of intermediate transporters needed. In our proposed solution, all participating entities are incentivized to act honestly by using a double deposit collateral. Automated payment in ether is an integral part of a solution to ensure that every entity gets its intended share of ether upon successful delivery. An arbitration mechanism is also incorporated if a dispute arises during the shipping process. In this paper, we show how we implemented, verified, and tested the proper functionality of our PoD solution. We also provide security analysis and give estimates of the cost consumption in ether gas. We made the full code of the Ethereum smart contracts publicly available at Github.

TI Bitcoin research across disciplines
SO INFORMATION SOCIETY
AB Over the last few years, research on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has snowballed across many disciplines: technical fields, economics, law, public policy, finance, accounting, and others. As the uses of blockchain technology behind Bitcoin expand, more disciplines will be drawn to its study and the research will greatly expand. This paper provides an assessment of the current state of the literature. From a comprehensive search of the literature that resulted in an original sample of 13,507 results, a final sample of 1,206 papers on Bitcoin are categorised and mapped across six disciplines.

TI Blockchain and the related issues: a review of current research topics
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT ANALYTICS
AB The blockchain represents emerging technologies and future trends. For the traditional social organization and mode of operation, the development of the blockchain is a revolution. As a decentralized infrastructure and distributed general ledger agreement, the blockchain presents us with a great opportunity to establish data security and trust for automation and intelligence development in the Internet of Things (IoT) and it creates a new un-centralized programmable smart ecosystem. Our research synthesizes and analyses extant articles that focus on blockchain-related perspectives which will potentially play an important role in sustainable development in the world. Blockchain applications and future directions always attract more attention. Blockchain technology provides strong scalability and interoperability between the intelligent and the physical worlds.

AB The blockchain technology witnessed a wide adoption and a swift growth in recent years. This ingenious distributed peer-to-peer design attracted several businesses and solicited several communities beyond the financial market. There are also multiple use cases built around its ecosystem. However, this backbone introduced a lot of speculation and has been criticized by several researchers. Moreover, the lack of legislations perceived a lot of attention. In this paper, we are concerned in analyzing blockchain networks and their development, focusing on their security challenges. We took a holistic approach to cover the involved mechanisms and the limitations of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger networks. We expose also numerous possible attacks and assess some countermeasures to dissuade vulnerabilities on the network. For occasion, we simulated the majority and the re-entrancy attacks. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Blockchain security summarizing its current state. Thoroughly showing threatening flaws, we are not concerned with favoring any particular blockchain network.

AB Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts.
   To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language.
   Securify is publicly released, it has analyzed > 18K contracts submitted by its users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits by experts. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations.

TI Continuous Patient Monitoring With a Patient Centric Agent: A Block
   Architecture
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has facilitated services without human intervention for a wide range of applications, including continuous remote patient monitoring (RPM). However, the complexity of RPM architectures, the size of data sets generated and limited power capacity of devices make RPM challenging. In this paper, we propose a tier-based End to End architecture for continuous patient monitoring that has a patient centric agent (PCA) as its center piece. The PCA manages a blockchain component to preserve privacy when data streaming from body area sensors needs to be stored securely. The PCA based architecture includes a lightweight communication protocol to enforce security of data through different segments of a continuous, real time patient monitoring architecture. The architecture includes the insertion of data into a personal blockchain to facilitate data sharing amongst healthcare professionals and integration into electronic health records while ensuring privacy is maintained. The blockchain is customized for RPM with modifications that include having the PCA select a Miner to reduce computational effort, enabling the PCA to manage multiple blockchains for the same patient, and the modification of each block with a prefix tree to minimize energy consumption and incorporate secure transaction payments. Simulation results demonstrate that security and privacy can be enhanced in RPM with the PCA based End to End architecture.

TI The security and financial implications of blockchain technologies:
   Regulating emerging technologies in Canada
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Driven by advances in data analytics, machine learning, and smart devices, financial technology is changing the way Canadians interact with the financial sector. The evolving landscape is further influenced by cryptocurrencies: non-fiat, decentralized digital payment systems, like Bitcoin, that operate outside the formal financial sector. While Bitcoin has garnered attention for facilitating criminal activity, including money laundering, terrorism financing, digital ransomware, weapons trafficking, and tax evasion, it is Bitcoin's underlying protocol, the blockchain, that represents an innovation capable of transforming financial services and challenging existing security, financial, and public safety regulations and policies. Canada's challenge is to find the right balance between oversight and innovation. Our paper examines these competing interests: we provide an overview of blockchain technologies, illustrate their potential in Canada and abroad, and examine the government's role in fostering innovation while concurrently bolstering regulations, maintaining public safety, and securing the integrity of financial systems.

AB Since its introduction in 2008, blockchain technology has outgrown its use in cryptocurrencies and is now preparing to revolutionize a multitude of commercial applications including value and supply chains, business models, and market structures. This work follows design science research to guide the implementation of a blockchain-based proof-of-concept prototype that enables the automated transaction of real-world assets, such as cars, and provides a valid, transparent, and immutable record of vehicle history to market participants, authorities, and other third parties. The contribution of this study to existing research is threefold: First, it introduces a built-in mechanism to reduce transaction risk resulting from the irreversibility of transactions in blockchain-based systems. Second, it replaces a trust-based, centralized, and bureaucratic register with a tamper-free and autonomous transactional database system that comprises a secure registration and transaction process. Third, it proposes a novel approach to mitigate adverse selection effects in lemon markets by providing a reliable, transparent, and complete record of each marketable asset's history. In total, the findings in this article illustrate the potential of blockchain-based systems but also highlight technological shortcomings and challenges for commercial applications, such as scalability or privacy issues.

TI Analysis on the influence factors of Bitcoin's price based on VEC model
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Background: Bitcoin, the most innovate digital currency as of now, created since 2008, even through experienced its ups and downs, still keeps drawing attentions to all parts of society. It relies on peer-to-peer network, achieved decentralization, anonymous and transparent. As the most representative digital currency, people curious to study how Bitcoin' price changes in the past.
   Methods: In this paper, we use monthly data from 2011 to 2016 to build a VEC model to exam how economic factors such as Custom price index, US dollar index, Dow jones industry average, Federal Funds Rate and gold price influence Bitcoin price.
   Result: From empirical analysis we find that all these variables do have a long-term influence. US dollar index is the biggest influence on Bitcoin price while gold price influence the least.
   Conclusion: From our result, we conclude that for now Bitcoin can be treated as a speculative asset, however, it is far from being a proper credit currency.

SO IEEE SPECTRUM
AB GOVERNMENTS EVERYWHERE WOULD LIKE TO CUT RED tape, reduce bureaucracy, and speed the delivery of services. But constituents are still often frustrated by mounds of paperwork and the snail-like pace of official business. Could a blockchain help? Just as blockchains have shaken up the financial industry and changed our perception of money, some government agencies now believe the technology could rejuvenate the public sector. Proponents argue that its immutability will protect records from fraudsters, its transparency will keep employees accountable, and its ability to automatically process new entries can make agencies more efficient. Such promises have persuaded city, state, and federal governments to launch the first batch of public-sector blockchain experiments. Two of the most enthusiastic early adopters have been the U.S. state of Illinois and the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. And intriguingly enough, the two have adopted very different strategies for mixing blockchains into government.

TI Anticipating the Economic Benefits of Blockchain
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB In this general overview article intended for non-experts, I define blockchain technology and some of the key concepts, and then I elaborate four specific applications that highlight the potential economic benefits of digital ledgers. These applications are digital asset registries, blockchains as leapfrog technology for global financial inclusion, long-tail personalized economic services, and net settlement payment channels. I also highlight key challenges that offset the potential economic benefits of blockchain distributed ledgers, while arguing that the benefits would outweigh the potential risks. The overarching theme is that an increasing amount of everyday operations involving money, assets, and documents could start to be conducted via blockchain-based distributed network ledgers with cryptographic security, and at more granular levels of detail. One economic implication of widespread blockchain adoption is that the institutional structure of society could shift to one that is computationally-based and thus has a diminished need for human-operated brick-and-mortar institutions.

TI A Blockchain Ecosystem for Digital Identity: Improving Service Delivery
   in Canada's Public and Private Sectors
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Blockchain-based solutions have the potential to make government operations more efficient and improve the delivery of services in the public and private sectors. Identity verification and authentication technologies, as one of the applications of blockchain-based solutions - and the focus of our own efforts at SecureKey Technologies - have been critical components in service delivery in both sectors due to their power to increase trust between citizens and the services they access. To convert trust into solid value added, identities must be validated through highly-reliable technologies, such as blockchain, that have the capacity to reduce cost and fraud and to simplify the experience for customers while also keeping out the bad actors. With identities migrating to digital platforms, organizations and citizens need to be able to transact with reduced friction even as more counter-bound services move to online delivery. In this article, drawing on our own experiences with an ecosystem approach to digital identity, we describe the potential value of using blockchain technology to address the present and future challenges of identity verification and authentication within a Canadian context.

TI Bitcoin - Its Economics for Financial Reporting
SO AUSTRALIAN ACCOUNTING REVIEW
AB Despite its increasing popularity, no official guidance on the financial reporting of Bitcoin transactions has been provided by standard setters, although tax accounting guidance began to appear in 2014. Designed as a decentralised currency, Bitcoin is not intended to become a reporting currency and will instead complement fiat money. We argue that in the case of Bitcoin the accounting principle of faithful representation requires interpretation of the economic substance for financial reporting that varies with reporting entity: trading firms recognise Bitcoin like a foreign currency and measure the revenue, or expense, at the equivalent amount of the reporting currency and digital currency exchanges recognise Bitcoin as goods in line with tax accounting treatment. An Economica paper by Radford (1945), which describes the use of cigarettes as commodity money in a prisoner of war camp alludes to this economic basis. This paper applies accounting principles to a practical issue and contributes to the process by which standard setters may issue an interpretation.
   No official guidance has been developed on the financial reporting of Bitcoin transactions. We argue that the accounting principle of faithful representation requires the interpretation of the economic substance for financial reporting that varies according to reporting entity. We aim to contribute to standard setters' conceptualisation of approaches to digital currency.

AB Memory-hard functions (MHFs) are hash algorithms whose evaluation cost is dominated by memory cost. As memory, unlike computation, costs about the same across different platforms, MHFs cannot be evaluated at significantly lower cost on dedicated hardware like ASICs. MHFs have found widespread applications including password hashing, key derivation, and proofs-of-work.
   This paper focuses on scrypt, a simple candidate MHF designed by Percival, and described in RFC 7914. It has been used within a number of cryptocurrencies (e.g., Litecoin and Dogecoin) and has been an inspiration for Argon2d, one of the winners of the recent password-hashing competition. Despite its popularity, no rigorous lower bounds on its memory complexity are known.
   We prove that scrypt is optimally memory-hard, i.e., its cumulative memory complexity (cmc) in the parallel random oracle model is Omega(n(2)w), where w and n are the output length and number of invocations of the underlying hash function, respectively. High cmc is a strong security target for MHFs introduced by Alwen and Serbinenko (STOC '15) which implies high memory cost even for adversaries who can amortize the cost over many evaluations and evaluate the underlying hash functions many times in parallel.
   Our proof is the first showing optimal memory-hardness for any MHF. Our result improves both quantitatively and qualitatively upon the recent work by Alwen et al. (EUROCRYPT '16) who proved a weaker lower bound of Omega(n(2) w/log(2) n) for a restricted class of adversaries.

AB Bitcoin is one of the most prominent examples of a distributed cryptographic protocol that is extensively used in reality. Nonetheless, existing security proofs are property-based, and as such they do not support composition.
   In this work we put forth a universally composable treatment of the Bitcoin protocol. We specify the goal that Bitcoin aims to achieve as a ledger functionality in the (G) UC model of Canetti et al. [TCC'07]. Our ledger functionality is weaker than the one recently proposed by Kiayias, Zhou, and Zikas [EUROCRYPT' 16], but unlike the latter suggestion, which is arguably not implementable given the Bitcoin assumptions, we prove that the one proposed here is securely UC realized under standard assumptions by an appropriate abstraction of Bitcoin as a UC protocol. We further show how known property-based approaches can be cast as special instances of our treatment and how their underlying assumptions can be cast in (G) UC without restricting the environment or the adversary.

AB Certification of keys and attributes is in practice typically realized by a hierarchy of issuers. Revealing the full chain of issuers for certificate verification, however, can be a privacy issue since it can leak sensitive information about the issuer's organizational structure or about the certificate owner. Delegatable anonymous credentials solve this problem and allow one to hide the full delegation (issuance) chain, providing privacy during both delegation and presentation of certificates. However, the existing delegatable credentials schemes are not efficient enough for practical use.
   In this paper, we present the first hierarchical (or delegatable) anonymous credential system that is practical. To this end, we provide a surprisingly simple ideal functionality for delegatable credentials and present a generic construction that we prove secure in the UC model. We then give a concrete instantiation using a recent pairing-based signature scheme by Groth and describe a number of optimizations and efficiency improvements that can be made when implementing our concrete scheme. The latter might be of independent interest for other pairing-based schemes as well. Finally, we report on an implementation of our scheme in the context of transaction authentication for blockchain, and provide concrete performance figures.

AB This paper is to explore applications of the blockchain technology to the concept of "proof of X" such as proof of identity, proof of property ownership, proof of specific transaction, proof of college degree, proof of medical records, proof of academic achievements, etc. It describes a novel approach of building a decentralized transparent immutable secure personal archive management and service system. Personal archive is defined as a collection of various artifacts that reflect personal portfolio as well as personal unique identifications. Personal portfolio is beyond of a statement of personal achievement. It is an evidentiary document designed to provide qualitative and quantitative chronically documents and examples. Subjects can tag their information with proof, that is, certified by trusted entities or organizations like universities. Such proofs are associated with confidentiality levels exposed in the public domains. Personal identifications include biometrics as well as other multi-factors such as something the subject "has", the subject "knows" or the subject "acts". Stack holders in a consortium oriented blockchain network serve as verifiers and /or miners that provide their trusted services the delegated proof of stake. Such personal archive based system can be exploited to various applications including professional network like Linkedin, instant credit approval like alipay or live human from social bots like internet social media. A prototype simulation shows that such personal portfolio management and service system is feasible and immune to many ID attacks.

AB Green transportation such as electric vehicles are emerging as an alternative to the traditional vehicles primarily due to the increasing cost and need of petroleum energy worldwide. These electric vehicle operate by using electric charging and the way to charge an electric car is to use a mobile charger or use a charging infrastructure. Therefore, when a mobile charger is used, a billing system is required through which a user is billed who has charged the electric vehicle. In this paper, we propose a mobile charger billing system that utilizes Blockchain technology. This technology has been applied to achieve more secure online transactions in a peer-to-peer manner. Moreover, we analyze the requirements of mobile charger for billing and propose a lightweight scheme that can overcome the challenge of data size in existing Blockchain.

AB Bitcoin introduces a revolutionary decentralized consensus mechanism. However, Bitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms applied to public blockchain are inadequate for the deployment scenarios of budding consortium blockchain. We propose a new consensus algorithm, Proof of Vote (POV). The consensus is coordinated by the distributed nodes controlled by consortium partners which will come to a decentralized arbitration by voting. The key idea is to establish different security identity for network participants, so that the submission and verification of the blocks are decided by the agencies' voting in the league without the depending on a third-party intermediary or uncontrollable public awareness. Compared with the fully decentralized consensus-Proof of Work (POW), POV has controllable security, convergence reliability, only one block confirmation to achieve the transaction finality, and low-delay transaction verification time.

AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are operated by a handful of mining pools. Nearly 95% of Bit coin's and 80% of Ethereum's mining power resides with less than ten and six mining pools respectively. Although miners benefit from low payout variance in pooled mining, centralized mining pools require members to trust that pool operators will remunerate them fairly. Furthermore, centralized pools pose the risk of transaction censorship from pool operators, and open up possibilities for collusion between pools for perpetrating severe attacks.
   In this work, we propose SMARTPOOL, a novel protocol design for a decentralized mining pool. Our protocol shows how one can leverage smart contracts, autonomous blockchain programs, to decentralize cryptocurrency mining SMARTPOOL gives transaction selection control back to miners while yielding low variance payouts. SMARTPOOL incurs mining fees lower than centralized mining pools and is designed to scale to a large number of miners. We implemented and deployed a robust SMARTPOOL implementation on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. To date, our deployed pools have handled a peak hashrate of 30 GHs from Ethereum miners, resulting in 105 blocks, costing miners a mere 0.6% of block rewards in transaction fees.

It surveys and compares four known techniques, proposes tailored metrics to identify the use of each technique (but not necessarily its users), and presents longitudinal measurements indicating adoption trends and teething troubles. There is a trade-off between the choice of users' preferred protection mechanisms and the risk that pertaining transactions can be singled out, which hurts privacy due to smaller anonymity sets unless a critical mass adopts the mechanism.

AB The ever-increasing number of IoT devices necessitates a secure and scalable infrastructure to store and process generated data. Blockchain is an ideal choice with its decentralized, trustless architecture. However, low-power IoT end-devices do not possess enough horsepower to run a software client for intensive blockchain calculations. The purpose of this paper is to create a proof of concept to enable low-power, resource-constrained IoT end-devices accessing a blockchain-based infrastructure. To achieve this aim, an IoT gateway is configured as a blockchain node and an event-based messaging mechanism for low-power IoT end-devices is proposed. A demonstration of such a system is realized using LoRa nodes and gateway in a private Ethereum network.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated deeply into our lives and the number of IoT devices per person is expected to increase substantially over the next few years. Due to the characteristics of IoT devices (i.e., low power and low battery), usage of these devices in critical applications requires sophisticated security measures. Researchers from academia and industry now increasingly exploit the concept of blockchains to achieve security in IoT applications. The basic idea of the blockchain is that the data generated by users or devices in the past are verified for correctness and cannot be tampered once it is updated on the blockchain. Even though the blockchain supports integrity and non-repudiation to some extent, confidentiality and privacy of the data or the devices are not preserved. The content of the data can be seen by anyone in the network for verification and mining purposes. In order to address these privacy issues, we propose a new privacy-preserving blockchain architecture for IoT applications based on attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques. Security, privacy, and numerical analyses are presented to validate the proposed model.

AB Blockchain is of rising importance as a technology for engineering applications in cross-organizational settings, avoiding reliance on central trusted third-parties. The use of blockchain, instead of traditional databases or services, is an architectural choice in the development of a software system. The costs of execution and storage are important non-functional qualities, but as yet very little has been done to study them for blockchain-based systems. We investigate the cost of using blockchain using business process execution as a lens. Specifically, we compare the cost for computation and storage of business process execution on blockchain vs. a popular cloud service. First, we capture the cost models for both alternatives. Second, we implemented and measured the cost of business process execution on blockchain and cloud services for an example business process model from the literature. We observe two orders of magnitude difference in this cost.

AB A permissioned blockchain (BC) is a secure distributed ledger maintained by a number of trusted validation nodes. However, a validator may become compromised and send inconsistent messages to different nodes. To counter the problem, consensus protocols like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) can be used. The paper presents a permissioned BC system and discusses various design issues including control messages, block size and window size of block creation time. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify those compromised nodes discovered during the consensus protocol. This paper then proposes a reputation system to track the trustworthiness of nodes as it is necessary to distinguish failed nodes from compromised nodes. A compromised node may send inconsistent messages to others or accuse other nodes compromised, and it should be removed as soon as it is identified and confirmed.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for sharing transactional data and computation without using a central trusted third party. It is an architectural choice to use a blockchain instead of traditional databases or protocols, and this creates trade-offs between non-functional requirements such as performance, cost, and security. However, little is known about predicting the behaviour of blockchain-based systems. This paper shows the feasibility of using architectural performance modelling and simulation tools to predict the latency of blockchain-based systems. We use established tools and techniques, but explore new blockchain-specific issues such as the configuration of the number of confirmation blocks and inter-block times. We report on a lab-based experimental study using an incident management system, showing predictions of median system level response time with a relative error mostly under 10%. We discuss how the approach can be used to support architectural decision-making, during the design of blockchain-based systems.

TI Blockchain based financial case analysis and its implications
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Purpose - In Korea and abroad, this paper investigates the use of blockchains in the financial sector. This study aims to examine how blockchains are applied to the financial sector and how to respond to the Korean conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper investigates the movements of the financial sector and related services using the blockchain in the current market.
   Findings - First, as a result of examining domestic and foreign cases, it can be seen that the areas where blockchains are most actively applied in the financial sector are expanding into settlement, remittance, securities and smart contracts. Also, in Korea, many of the authentication procedures based on the equipment possessed by the consumers are used so that introduction of the blockchain in the authentication part is prominent. Second, the move to introduce a closed (private) distributed ledger that does not go through the central bank is accelerating in payments between banks. Third, domestic financial institutions also need joint action by financial institutions through a blockchain consortium to apply blockchain technology to the financial sector. Fourth, consumer needs and technological developments are changing. At the same time, as the opportunity to infringe on the information held by individuals has expanded, the need for blockchain technology is strongly emerging because of the efforts of the organizations to defend it.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes to understanding the changes in the financial sector using the blockchain.

TI Funny money: the attentional role of monetary feedback detached from
   expected value
SO ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS
AB Stimuli associated with monetary reward can become powerful cues that effectively capture visual attention. We examined whether such value-driven attentional capture can be induced with monetary feedback in the absence of an expected cash payout. To this end, we implemented images of U.S. dollar bills as reward feedback. Participants knew in advance that they would not receive any money based on their performance. Our reward stimuli-$5 and $20 bill images-were thus dissociated from any practical utility. Strikingly, we observed a reliable attentional capture effect for the mere images of bills. Moreover, this finding generalized to Monopoly money. In two control experiments, we found no evidence in favor of nominal or symbolic monetary value. Hence, we claim that bill images are special monetary representations, such that there are strong associations between the defining visual features of bills and reward, probably due to a lifelong learning history. Together, we show that the motivation to earn cash plays a minor role when it comes to monetary rewards, while bill-defining visual features seem to be sufficient. These findings have the potential to influence human factor applications, such as gamification, and can be extended to novel value systems, such as the electronic cash Bitcoin being developed for use in mobile banking. Finally, our procedure represents a proof of concept on how images of money can be used to conserve expenditures in the experimental context.

TI On Not Being a Sign: Gold's Semiotic Claims
SO SIGNS AND SOCIETY
AB In this essay I examine gold's semiotic claims in the context of perceptions of gold in global financial markets, beginning with an intriguing parallel drawn by my informants between gold and Bitcoin. I make several interrelated arguments: (1) that in a variety of cultural contexts, gold has become a site for a very particular semiotic claim-that of not signifying at all; (2) that in the contemporary instance of physical gold in relation to other assets based on gold, this is expressed in an attention to gold's material, tactile qualities (represented both iconically and indexically), and its extrasocial character; (3) that similar claims are made for Bitcoin, often drawing on a "digital metallism," and idiom of gold; and (4) that the self-reflexive semiotic properties of gold have a long and diverse cultural history. In concluding, I speculate on how gold's particular semiotic stance reflects one possible articulation of nature and convention as sources of meaning.

CY SEP 26-30, 2016

AB One of the most promising innovations offered by the cryptographic currencies (like Bitcoin) are the so-called smart contracts, which can be viewed as financial agreements between mutually distrusting participants. Their execution is enforced by the mechanics of the currency, and typically has monetary consequences for the parties. The rules of these contracts are written in the form of so-called "scripts", which are pieces of code in some "scripting language". Although smart contracts are believed to have a huge potential, for the moment they are not widely used in practice. In particular, most of Bitcoin miners allow only to post standard transactions (i.e.: those without the non-trivial scripts) on the blockchain. As a result, it is currently very hard to create non-trivial smart contracts in Bitcoin.
   Motivated by this, we address the following question: "is it possible to create non-trivial efficient smart contracts using the standard transactions only?" We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing efficient Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payment protocol for a large class of NP-relations. This includes the relations for which efficient sigma protocols exist. In particular, our protocol can be used to sell a factorization (p,q) of an RSA modulus n = pq, which is an example that we implemented and tested its efficiency in practice.
   As another example of the "smart contract without scripts" we show how our techniques can be used to implement the contract called "trading across chains".

TI ELECTRONIC VOTING SERVICE USING BLOCK-CHALET
SO JOURNAL OF DIGITAL FORENSICS SECURITY AND LAW
AB Cryptocurrency, and its underlying technologies, has been gaining popularity for transaction management beyond financial transactions. Transaction information is maintained in the block chain, which can be used to audit the integrity of the transaction. The focus on this paper is the potential availability of block-chain technology of other transactional uses. Block-chain is one of the most stable open ledgers that preserves transaction information, and is difficult to forge. Since the information stored in block-chain is not related to personally identifiable information, it has the characteristics of anonymity. Also, the block-chain allows for transparent transaction verification since all information in the block-chain is open to the public. These characteristics are the same as the requirements for a voting system. That is, strong robustness, anonymity, and transparency. In this paper, we propose an electronic voting system as an application of block chain, and describe block-chain based voting at a national level through examples.

AB Often, we wish to let parties alter or undo a contract that has been made. Toward this end, contract law has developed a set of traditional tools for altering and undoing contracts. Unfortunately, these tools often fail when applied to smart contracts. It is therefore necessary to define a new set of standards for the altering and undoing of smart contracts. These standards might ensure that the tools we use to alter and undo smart contracts achieve their original (contract law) goals when applied to this new technology. This paper develops such a set of standards and, then, to prove their worth as a framework, applies to them to an existing smart contract platform (Ethereum).

AB Blockchain is a radical innovation that has a significant impact on payments, stock exchanges, cybersecurity, and computational law. However, it has significant limitations regarding uncertainty for a transaction to be confirmed. This paper proposes a new system for exact confirmation of transactions in a block. Replacing original signature, a new Interactive Incontestable Signature (IIS) scheme is used between dealer and owner to confirm a transaction. By this signature, the dealer can assure the owner that a transaction will be included into blockchain in a non-repudiation way. The scheme is proved to be secure for owner's unforgeability and dealer's incontestability.

TI Salt-dependent surface activity and micellization behaviour of
   zwitterionic amphiphilic diblock copolymers having carboxybetaine
SO COLLOID AND POLYMER SCIENCE
AB Zwitterionic amphiphilic diblock copolymers having n-butylacrylate(n-BA) and carboxybetaine as hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks, respectively, with various chain lengths were synthesized by the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization method. The effects of salt and chain length on the solution behaviour of zwitterionic amphiphilic diblock copolymers were investigated using surface tension, static light scattering (SLS), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence spectroscopic measurements. Surface tension measurements revealed that zwitterionic amphiphilic diblock copolymers undergo transition from surface active to non-surface active after addition of salt. This may be due to the transition from zwitterionic (almost zero charge) to ionic nature of the betaine block by addition of small amount of salt followed by an increase of solvent power of salt solution. Foam formation behaviour decreased with increasing chain length. The critical micelle concentration was decreased drastically by the presence of a small amount of salt, which reflected the non-surface active nature of block copolymer. Increase in values of hydrodynamic radii with increase in salt is attributed to stretching of the hydrophilic chain due to the ionic nature of the block chain and the increase of solvent power. Aggregation number (N (agg) ) and the second virial coefficient (A (2)) decreased with the increase in chain length as well as after addition of salt. Packing parameters of block copolymer micelles were less than 0.3 which implies that the micellar shape is spherical. Some unique aspects of zwitterionic polymer were elucidated, which are largely different from simple ionic (anionic and cationic) polymers.

TI Predicting Search Intent Based on Pre-Search Context

SP Assoc Comp Machinery Special Interest Grp Informat Retrieval
AB While many studies have been conducted on query understanding, there is limited understanding on why users start searches and how to predict search intent. In this paper, we propose to study this important but less explored problem. Our key intuition is that searches are triggered by different pre-search contexts, but the triggering relations are often hidden. For example, a user may search "bitcoin" because of a news article or an email the user just read, but the system does not know which of the pre-search contexts (the news article or the email) is the triggering source. Following this intuition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of pre-search context on a large-scale user log, which not only verifies the hidden triggering relations in the real world but also identifies a set of important characteristics of pre-search context and their triggered queries. Since the hidden triggering relations make it challenging to directly use pre-search context for intent prediction, we develop a mixture generative model to learn without any supervision how queries are triggered by different types of pre-search context. Further, we discuss how to apply our model to improve query prediction and query auto-completion. Our experiments on a large-scale of real-world data show that our model could accurately predict user search intent with pre-search context and improve upon the state-of-the-art methods significantly.

TI Relationship Between Intimate Partner Violence, Depressive
   Symptomatology, and Personality Traits
SO JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE
AB The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between intimate partner violence (IPV) and personality disorder symptoms controlling for depressive state. Victims of IPV (n = 176) and non-abused women (n = 193) completed the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ), Index of Spouse Abuse (ISA), and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). IPV victims scored higher than non-abused women on Intimacy Problems, and scored lower on Rejection traits, after adjustment for depressive symptoms. Severity of the IPV was related to Cognitive Distortion, Suspiciousness, Restricted Expression, and Intimacy Problems, and the length of the IPV was negatively associated with Rejection. The current study suggests only modest differences in personality traits between IPV and non-abused women. The DAPP-BQ traits associated with severity of IPV, in a dose-response manner, would partially reflect the symptoms of complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), although this possibility deserves further study.

TI Non-linear adaptive closed-loop control system for improved efficiency
   in IoT-blockchain management
SO INFORMATION FUSION
AB IoT network generates a large amount of data. This means that the monitoring and control of these networks and the transfer of packets from the IoT network to the server can cause communications to collapse. On the other hand, due to the large volume of data stored in the databases the monitoring of the IoT network needs very powerful servers to have a high degree of efficiency. This paper presents a novel adaptive closed-loop control system and speed up searches model to improve the monitor and control efficiency in IoT networks, specially those which are based in blockchain. The non linear control model under consideration includes a new way to evaluate the optimal number of blocks that should be at the queue of the miners' network in order to make the process efficient through the use of queuing theory. Also, a new system to speed up searches is presented by using hashmaps, which makes the monitoring process faster, reliable and efficient. The efficiency of the presented approach is illustrated by a numerical case study.

AB Using a bivariate Diagonal BEKK model, this paper investigates the volatility dynamics of the two major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin and Ether. We find evidence of interdependencies in the cryptocurrency market, while it is shown that the two cryptocurrencies' conditional volatility and correlation are responsive to major news. In addition, we show that Ether can be an effective hedge against Bitcoin, while the analysis of optimal portfolio weights indicates that Bitcoin should outweigh Ether. Understanding volatility movements and interdependencies in cryptocurrency markets is important for appropriate investment management, and our study can thus assist cryptocurrency users in making more informed decisions.

TI Based Medical Systems for Patient's Authentication: Towards a New
   Verification Secure Framework Using CIA Standard
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB In medical systems for patient's authentication, keeping biometric data secure is a general problem. Many studies have presented various ways of protecting biometric data especially finger vein biometric data. Thus, It is needs to find better ways of securing this data by applying the three principles of information security aforementioned, and creating a robust verification system with high levels of reliability, privacy and security. Moreover, it is very difficult to replace biometric information and any leakage of biometrics information leads to earnest risks for example replay attacks using the robbed biometric data. In this paper presented criticism and analysis to all attempts as revealed in the literature review and discussion the proposes a novel verification secure framework based confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) standard in triplex blockchain-particle swarm optimization (PSO)-advanced encryption standard (AES) techniques for medical systems patient's authentication. Three stages are performed on discussion. Firstly, proposes a new hybrid model pattern in order to increase the randomization based on radio frequency identification (RFID) and finger vein biometrics. To achieve this, proposed a new merge algorithm to combine the RFID features and finger vein features in one hybrid and random pattern. Secondly, how the propose verification secure framework are followed the CIA standard for telemedicine authentication by combination of AES encryption technique, blockchain and PSO in steganography technique based on proposed pattern model. Finally, discussed the validation and evaluation of the proposed verification secure framework.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB The digitalization and massive adoption of advanced technologies in the automotive industry not only transform the equipment manufacturer's operating mode, but also change the current business models. The increased adoption of autonomous cars is expected to disrupt government regulations, manufacturing, insurance, and maintenance services. Moreover, providing integrated, personalized, and on-demand services have shared, connected, and autonomous cars in the smart city for a sustainable ecosystem. To address these issues in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based distributed framework for the automotive industry in the smart city. The proposed framework includes a novel miner node selection algorithm for the blockchain-based distributed network architecture. To evaluate the feasibility of the proposed framework, we simulated the proposed model on a private Ethereum blockchain platform using captured dataset of mined blocks from litecoinpool. org. The simulation results show the proof-of-concept of the proposed model that can be used for wide range of future smart applications.

SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We extend our limited understanding on the Granger causality from trading volume to the returns and volatility in the cryptocurrency market via a copula-quantile causality approach. Using daily data of seven leading cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, Nem, Dash, and Stellar), results show that trading volume Granger causes extreme negative and positive returns of all cryptocurrencies under study. However, volume Granger causes return volatility for only three cryptocurrencies (Litecoin, NEM, and Dash) when the volatility is low. However, this latter result only holds when squared returns are used as a proxy of volatility and not when GARCH volatility is employed.

TI Blockchain based searchable encryption for electronic health record
   sharing
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Data leakage in electronic health records (EHRs) could result in the compromise of patient privacy (e.g. medical conditions). Generally most data in EHRs remain unchanged once they are uploaded to the system; thus, blockchain can be potentially used to facilitate the sharing of such data. Different participating medical organizations and individuals (e.g. medical practitioners, hospitals, medical labs and insurance companies) can then access EHRs stored on the blockchain with a higher level of confidence. In this paper, a blockchain based searchable encryption scheme for EHRs is proposed. The index for EHRs is constructed through complex logic expressions and stored in the blockchain, so that a data user can utilize the expressions to search the index. As only the index is migrated to the blockchain to facilitate propagation, the data owners have full control over who can see their EHRs data. The use of blockchain technology ensures the integrity, anti-tampering, and traceability of EHR's index. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated from two aspects, namely in terms of the overhead for extracting the document IDs from EHRs and the overhead associated with conducting transactions on smart contract in Ethereum.

TI Computing Resource Trading for Edge-Cloud-Assisted Internet of Things
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Optimal computing resource allocation for edge-cloud-assisted Internet of things (IoT) in blockchain network is attracting increasing attention. Auction is a classical algorithm which guarantees that the computing resources are allocated to the buyers of the computing resource. However, the traditional auction algorithm only guarantees the revenue gains for the sellers of the computing resource. How to guarantee the seller and the buyer of the computing resource when both are willing to trade and moreover, bid truthfully, is still an open problem in computing resource trading for edge-cloud-assisted IoT. In this paper, we introduce a broker with sparse information to manage and adjust the trading market. We then propose an iterative double-sided auction scheme for computing resource trading, where the broker solves an allocation problem to determine how much computing resource is traded and designs a specific price rule to induce the buyers and sellers of the computing resource to submit bids in a truthful way. Thus, hidden information can be extracted gradually to obtain optimal computing resource allocation and trading prices. Hence, the proposed algorithm can achieve the maximum social welfare meanwhile protecting the privacies of the buyers and the sellers. Our theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is efficient, i.e., it achieves the maximum social welfare. In addition, the proposed algorithm can provide effective trading strategies for the buyers and sellers of the computing resource, leading to the proposed algorithm satisfying incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance.

TI Blockchain in healthcare applications: Research challenges and
   opportunities
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain has a range of built-in features, such as distributed ledger, decentralized storage, authentication, security, and immutability, and has moved beyond hype to practical applications in industry sectors such as Healthcare. Blockchain applications in the healthcare sector generally require more stringent authentication, interoperability, and record sharing requirements, due to exacting legal requirements, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Building on existing blockchain technologies, researchers in both academia and industry have started to explore applications that are geared toward healthcare use. These applications include smart contracts, fraud detection, and identity verification. Even with these improvements, there are still concerns as blockchain technology has its own specific vulnerabilities and issues that need to be addressed, such as mining incentives, mining attacks, and key management. Additionally, many of the healthcare applications have unique requirements that are not addressed by many of the blockchain experiments being explored, as highlighted in this survey paper. A number of potential research opportunities are also discussed in this paper.

TI A Blockchain-Based Nonrepudiation Network Computing Service Scheme for
   Industrial IoT
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Emerging network computing technologies extend the functionalities of industrial IoT (IIoT) terminals. However, this promising service-provisioning scheme encounters problems in untrusted and distributed IIoT scenarios because malicious service providers or clients may deny service provisions or usage for their own interests. Traditional nonrepudiation solutions fade in IIoT environments due to requirements of trusted third parties or unacceptable overheads. Fortunately, the blockchain revolution facilitates innovative solutions. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based fair nonrepudiation service provisioning scheme for IIoT scenarios in which the blockchain is used as a service publisher and an evidence recorder. Each service is separately delivered via on-chain and off-chain channels with mandatory evidence submissions for nonrepudiation purpose. Moreover, a homomorphic-hash-based service verification method is designed that can function with mere on-chain evidence. And an impartial smart contract is implemented to resolve disputes. The security analysis demonstrates the dependability, and the evaluations reveal the effectiveness and efficiency.

TI The Blockchain Folk Theorem
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB Blockchains are distributed ledgers, operated within peer-to-peer networks. We model the proof-of-work blockchain protocol as a stochastic game and analyze the equilibrium strategies of rational, strategic miners. Mining the longest chain is a Markov perfect equilibrium, without forking, in line with Nakamoto (2008). The blockchain protocol, however, is a coordination game, with multiple equilibria. There exist equilibria with forks, leading to orphaned blocks and persistent divergence between chains. We also show how forks can be generated by information delays and software upgrades. Last we identify negative externalities implying that equilibrium investment in computing capacity is excessive. Received May 31, 2017; editorial decision July 6, 2018 by Editor Itay Goldstein.

TI Is Bitcoin a better safe-haven investment than gold and commodities?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB This paper addresses the timely question of whether Bitcoin exhibits a safe-haven property for stock market investments during extreme market conditions and whether such a property is similar to or different from that of gold and the general commodity index. We propose a new definition of a weak and strong safe-haven within a bivariate cross-quantilogram approach. This definition considers the lowest tails of both the safe-haven asset and the stock index. Our sample period spans from 19 July 2010 until 22 February 2018 and focuses on several stock market indices, including those of the US, China, and other developed and emerging economies. Our main results show that, at best, each of Bitcoin, gold, and the commodity index can be considered as a weak safe-haven asset in some cases. Rolling-window predictability analyses generally confirm those results and reveal that the safe-haven roles of Bitcoin, gold, and commodities are time-varying and differ across the stock market indices under study.

TI Bitcoin price and its marginal cost of production: support for a
   fundamental value
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This study back-tests a marginal cost of production model proposed to value the digital currency Bitcoin. Results from both conventional regression and vector autoregression (VAR) models show that the marginal cost of production plays an important role in explaining Bitcoin prices, challenging recent allegations that Bitcoins are essentially worthless. Even with markets pricing Bitcoin in the thousands of dollars each, the valuation model seems robust. The data show that a price bubble that began in the Fall of 2017 resolved itself in early 2018, converging with the marginal cost model. This suggests that while bubbles may appear in the Bitcoin market, prices will tend to this bound and not collapse to zero.

TI Investigating volatility transmission and hedging properties between
   Bitcoin and Ethereum
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB This paper sets out to test the hypothesis whether volatility spillovers and hedging abilities exist between Bitcoin and Ethereum by a multivariate BEKK-GARCH methodology and impulse response analysis applied within a VAR model since the launch of Ethereum up to June 2018. The findings reveal significant swaps in the time-varying correlation and a delayed positive response of Bitcoin volatility on a positive volatility shock on Ethereum returns. The overarching implications of the results are that Bitcoin and Ethereum although presented some diversifying capabilities over the first years of the study these capabilities are recently significantly reduced. Moreover, the unidirectional volatility transmission from Ethereum to Bitcoin implies that profitable trading strategies may be established on a newly developed derivative market with consequences against market efficiency.

TI Blockchain and OECD data repositories: opportunities and policymaking
   implications
SO LIBRARY HI TECH
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to employ the case of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data repositories to examine the potential of blockchain technology in the context of addressing basic contemporary societal concerns, such as transparency, accountability and trust in the policymaking process. Current approaches to sharing data employ standardized metadata, in which the provider of the service is assumed to be a trusted party. However, derived data, analytic processes or links from policies, are in many cases not shared in the same form, thus breaking the provenance trace and making the repetition of analysis conducted in the past difficult. Similarly, it becomes tricky to test whether certain conditions justifying policies implemented still apply. A higher level of reuse would require a decentralized approach to sharing both data and analytic scripts and software. This could be supported by a combination of blockchain and decentralized file system technology. Design/methodology/approach The findings presented in this paper have been derived from an analysis of a case study, i.e., analytics using data made available by the OECD. The set of data the OECD provides is vast and is used broadly. The argument is structured as follows. First, current issues and topics shaping the debate on blockchain are outlined. Then, a redefinition of the main artifacts on which some simple or convoluted analytic results are based is revised for some concrete purposes. The requirements on provenance, trust and repeatability are discussed with regards to the architecture proposed, and a proof of concept using smart contracts is used for reasoning on relevant scenarios. Findings A combination of decentralized file systems and an open blockchain such as Ethereum supporting smart contracts can ascertain that the set of artifacts used for the analytics is shared. This enables the sequence underlying the successive stages of research and/or policymaking to be preserved. This suggests that, in turn, and ex post, it becomes possible to test whether evidence supporting certain findings and/or policy decisions still hold. Moreover, unlike traditional databases, blockchain technology makes it possible that immutable records can be stored. This means that the artifacts can be used for further exploitation or repetition of results. In practical terms, the use of blockchain technology creates the opportunity to enhance the evidence-based approach to policy design and policy recommendations that the OECD fosters. That is, it might enable the stakeholders not only to use the data available in the OECD repositories but also to assess corrections to a given policy strategy or modify its scope.
   Research limitations/implications - Blockchains and related technologies are still maturing, and several questions related to their use and potential remain underexplored. Several issues require particular consideration in future research, including anonymity, scalability and stability of the data repository. This research took as example OECD data repositories, precisely to make the point that more research and more dialogue between the research and policymaking community is needed to embrace the challenges and opportunities blockchain technology generates. Several questions that this research prompts have not been addressed. For instance, the question of how the sharing economy concept for the specifics of the case could be employed in the context of blockchain has not been dealt with.
   Practical implications - The practical implications of the research presented here can be summarized in two ways. On the one hand, by suggesting how a combination of decentralized file systems and an open blockchain, such as Ethereum supporting smart contracts, can ascertain that artifacts are shared, this paper paves the way toward a discussion on how to make this approach and solution reality. The approach and architecture proposed in this paper would provide a way to increase the scope of the reuse of statistical data and results and thus would improve the effectiveness of decision making as well as the transparency of the evidence supporting policy.
   Social implications - Decentralizing analytic artifacts will add to existing open data practices an additional layer of benefits for different actors, including but not limited to policymakers, journalists, analysts and/or researchers without the need to establish centrally managed institutions. Moreover, due to the degree of decentralization and absence of a single-entry point, the vulnerability of data repositories to cyberthreats might be reduced. Simultaneously, by ensuring that artifacts derived from data based in those distributed depositories are made immutable therein, full reproducibility of conclusions concerning the data is possible. In the field of data-driven policymaking processes, it might allow policymakers to devise more accurate ways of addressing pressing issues and challenges.
   Originality/value - This paper offers the first blueprint of a form of sharing that complements open data practices with the decentralized approach of blockchain and decentralized file systems. The case of OECD data repositories is used to highlight that while data storing is important, the real added value of blockchain technology rests in the possible change on how we use the data and data sets in the repositories. It would eventually enable a more transparent and actionable approach to linking policy up with the supporting evidence. From a different angle, throughout the paper the case is made that rather than simply data, artifacts from conducted analyses should be made persistent in a blockchain. What is at stake is the full reproducibility of conclusions based on a given set of data, coupled with the possibility of ex post testing the validity of the assumptions and evidence underlying those conclusions.

TI Is Bitcoin a bubble?
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The narrative of a Bitcoin is a bubble is very common. We employ statistical techniques to empirically evaluate such claim. A branch of literature links the existence of a bubble in some financial asset's price to strict local martingales - a finitely lived asset has a bubble if, and only if, it is a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high frequency prices, as well as of more traditional financial assets. We then estimate the stochastic volatility model of Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), whose parameter space has a specific subset under which the asset's price is a strict local martingale. Results suggest the existence of a bubble in Bitcoin prices from early 2013 to mid 2014, but, interestingly, not in late 2017. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Holding Bitcoin longer: The dynamic hedging abilities of Bitcoin
SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB This paper investigates whether Bitcoin can hedge and diversify risk against the Euro STOXX, Nikkei, Shanghai A-Share, S&P 500, and the TSX Index, and examines the dynamics of these abilities over different data frequencies. Pairwise GARCH models and constant conditional correlation models are used for daily, weekly, and monthly returns from October 2010 to October 2017. We find that Bitcoin is an effective strong hedge for all these indices under monthly data frequency. However, daily and weekly returns do not demonstrate strong hedge properties. Further frequency dependence model tests reveal that Bitcoin returns are strong hedgings against S&P and Euro indices over medium data frequency, and also against the Shanghai A-Share over low data frequency.

AB The blockchain is a safe, reliable, and innovative mechanism for managing numerous vehicles seeking connectivity. However, following the principles of the blockchain, the number of transactions required to update ledgers poses serious issues for vehicles as these may consume the maximum available energy. To resolve this, an efficient model is presented in this letter, which is capable of handling the energy demands of the blockchain-enabled Internet of Vehicles by optimally controlling the number of transactions through distributed clustering. Numerical results suggest that the proposed approach is 40.16% better in terms of energy conservation and 82.06% better in terms of the number of transactions required to share the entire blockchain data compared with the traditional blockchain.

TI Fintech and the Innovation Trilemma
SO GEORGETOWN LAW JOURNAL
AB Whether in response to robo advising, artificial intelligence, or crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, regulators around the world have made it a top policy priority to supervise the exponential growth of financial technology (or "fintech") in the post-crisis era. However, applying traditional regulatory strategies to new technological ecosystems has proved conceptually difficult. Part of the challenge lies in managing the trade-offs that accompany the regulation of innovations that could, conceivably, both help and hurt consumers as well as market participants. Problems also arise from the common assumption that today's fintech is a mere continuation of the story of innovation that has shaped finance for centuries.
   This Article offers a new theoretical framework for understanding and regulating fintech by showing how the supervision of financial innovation is invariably bound by what can be described as a policy trilemma. Specifically, we argue that when seeking to provide clear rules, maintain market integrity, and encourage financial innovation, regulators have long been able to achieve, at best, only two out of these three goals. Moreover, today's innovations exacerbate the trade-offs historically embodied in the trilemma by breaking down financial services supply chains into discrete parts and disintermediating traditional functions using cutting edge, but untested, technologies, thereby introducing unprecedented uncertainty as to their risks and benefits. This Article seeks to catalogue the strategies taken by regulatory authorities to navigate the trilemma, and posits them as operating across a spectrum of interrelated responses. The Article then proposes supplemental administrative tools to support not only market, but also regulatory experimentation and innovation.

TI Monetization of IoT data using smart contracts
SO IET NETWORKS
AB In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), smart connected devices have the ability to generate data that could be of interest to the public. This paves the way for an emerging market for monetized data exchanges, where IoT device owners can sell access to live data generated by their connected devices to interested users. Implementing a trusted, cost-efficient, automatic monetization solution of IoT data can be a challenging problem and usually involves intermediaries and centralised governance and management. Blockchain and smart contracts introduce a secure and trusted platform to carry out transactions in a highly trusted, secure, decentralised manner. In this study, they present a blockchain-solution and implementation using Ethereum smart contracts for monetizing IoT data with automated payment involving no intermediary. The authors discuss key aspects related to architectural design, entity relations, interactions among participants, logic flow, implementation and testing of the overall system functionality.

TI Blockchain Technology: A Data Framework to Improve Validity, Trust, and
   Accountability of Information Exchange in Health Professions Education
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB Health professions educators face multiple challenges, among them the need to adapt educational methods to new technologies. In the last decades, multiple new digital platforms have appeared in the learning arena, including massive open online courses and social-media-based education. The major critique of these novel methods is the lack of the ability to ascertain the origin, validity, and accountability of the knowledge that is created, shared, and acquired. Recently, a novel technology based on secured data storage and transmission, called blockchain, has emerged as a way to generate networks where validity, trust, and accountability can be created. Conceptually, blockchain is an open, public, distributed, and secure digital registry where information transactions are secured and have a clear origin, explicit pathways, and concrete value. Health professions education based on blockchain will potentially allow improved tracking of content and the individuals who create it, quantify educational impact on multiple generations of learners, and build a relative value of educational interventions. Furthermore, institutions adopting blockchain technology would be able to provide certification and credentialing of health care professionals with no intermediaries. There is potential for blockchain to significantly change the future of health professions education and radically transform how patients, professionals, educators, and learners interact around safe, valid, and accountable information.

TI CRIX an Index for cryptocurrencies
SO JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE
AB The cryptocurrency market is unique on many levels: Very volatile, frequently changing market structure, emerging and vanishing of cryptocurrencies on a daily level. Following its development became a difficult task with the success of cryptocurrencies (CCs) other than Bitcoin. For fiat currency markets, the IMF offers the index SDR and, prior to the EUR, the ECU existed, which was an index representing the development of European currencies. Index providers decide on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a challenge to fix a number and develop rules for the constituents in view of the market changes. In the frequently changing CC market, this challenge is even more severe. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market. CRIX is chosen by model selection such that it represents the market well to enable each interested party studying economic questions in this market and to invest into the market. The diversified nature of the CC market makes the inclusion of altcoins in the index product critical to improve tracking performance. We have shown that assigning optimal weights to altcoins helps to reduce the tracking errors of a CC portfolio, despite the fact that their market cap is much smaller relative to Bitcoin. The codes used here are available via www.quantlet.de.

TI Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading among Microgrids with Multidimensional
   Willingness
SO ENERGIES
AB Networked microgrids are emerging for coordinating distributed energy resources in distribution networks in the future Energy Internet, for which developing an efficient energy market model is crucial for facilitating multi-directional trading among microgrids. In this paper, a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism is presented using non-cooperative bidding among microgrids. Multidimensional willingness, including time pressure and counter behavior for mimicking the personalized behaviors of microgrids, was taken into account in the design of the bidding strategy. Under a parallel trading framework based on a blockchain, the proposed multidimensional willingness bidding strategy turns out to be able to make rational decisions with sufficient flexibility in the bidding process. The simulation results of a realistic case of microgrids from Guizhou Province, China, validate that the proposed peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism is capable of raising the microgrids' profits and renewable energy source utilization.

PHS uses artificial healthcare systems to model and represent patient's conditions, diagnosis, and treatment process, then applies computational experiments to analyze and evaluate various therapeutic regimens, and implements parallel execution for decision-making support and real-time optimization in both actual and artificial healthcare processes. In addition, we combine the emerging blockchain technology with PHS, via constructing a consortium blockchain linking patients, hospitals, health bureaus, and healthcare communities for comprehensive healthcare data sharing, medical records review, and care auditability. Finally, a prototype named parallel gout diagnosis and treatment system is built and deployed to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the blockchain-powered PHS framework.

TI A Technical Approach to the Energy Blockchain in Microgrids
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB The present paper considers some technical issues related to the "energy blockchain" paradigm applied to microgrids. In particular, what appears from the study is that the superposition of energy transactions in a microgrid creates a variation of the power losses in all the branches of the microgrid. Traditional power losses allocation in distribution systems takes into account only generators while, in this paper, a real-time attribution of power losses to each transaction involving one generator and one load node is done by defining some suitable indices. Besides, the presence of P-V nodes increases the level of reactive flows and provides a more complex technical perspective. For this reason, reactive power generation for voltage support at P-V nodes poses a further problem of reactive power flow exchange, which is worth of investigation in future works in order to define a possible way of remuneration. The experimental section of the paper considers a medium voltage microgrid and two different operational scenarios.

AB With the rapid development of internet of things (IoT), it has brought great convenience to users in different fields, such as smart home, smart transportation and so on. However, it also carries potential security risks. In order to solve this challenge, in this paper, we first introduce three layers of IoT, i.e., perception layer, network layer and application layer, then corresponding security problems of three layers are introduced. Second, we propose a high-level security management scheme based on blockchain for different IoT devices in the full life cycle. Finally, we give open research problems and future work.

TI A Blockchain-Based Authorization System for Trustworthy Resource
   Monitoring and Trading in Smart Communities
SO SENSORS
AB Resource consumption in residential areas requires novel contributions in the field of consumer information management and collaborative mechanisms for the exchange of resources, in order to optimize the overall consumption of the community. We propose an authorization system to facilitate access to consumer information and resource trading, based on blockchain technology. Our proposal is oriented to the Smart communities, an evolution of Community Energy Management Systems, in which communities are involved in the monitoring and coordination of resource consumption. The proposed environment allows a more reliable management of monitoring and authorization functions, with secure data access and storage and delegation of controller functions among householders. We provide the definition of virtual assets for energy and water resource sharing as an auction, which encourages the optimization of global consumption and saves resources. The proposed solution is implemented and validated in application scenarios that demonstrate the suitability of the defined consensus mechanism, trustworthiness in the level of provided security for resource monitoring and delegation and reduction on resource consumption by the resource trading contribution.

TI Real-time renewable energy incentive system for electric vehicles using
   prioritization and cryptocurrency
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Significant increase in the installation and penetration of Renewable Energy Resources (RES) has raised intermittency and variability issues in the electric power grid. Solutions based on fast-response energy storage can be costly, especially when dealing with higher renewable energy penetration rate. The rising popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) also brings challenges to the system planning, dispatching and operation. Due to the random dynamic nature of electric vehicle charging and routing, electric vehicle load can be challenging to the power distribution operators and utilities. The bright side is that the load of EV charging is shiftable and can be leveraged to reduce the variability of renewable energy by consuming it locally. In this paper, we proposed a real-time system that incorporates the concepts of prioritization and cryptocurrency, named SMERCOIN, to incentivize electric vehicle users to collectively charge with a renewable energy-friendly schedule. The system implements a ranking scheme by giving charging priority to users with a better renewable energy usage history. By incorporating a blockchain-based cryptocurrency component, the system can incentivize user with monetary and non-monetary means in a flat-rate system. The effectiveness of the system mechanism has been verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. The system experiment has been implemented on campus of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for 15 months and the results show that the usage of solar energy has increased significantly.

AB In this paper we forecast daily returns of crypto-currencies using a wide variety of different econometric models. To capture salient features commonly observed in financial time series like rapid changes in the conditional variance, non-normality of the measurement errors and sharply increasing trends, we develop a time-varying parameter VAR with t-distributed measurement errors and stochastic volatility. To control for overparametrization, we rely on the Bayesian literature on shrinkage priors, which enables us to shrink coefficients associated with irrelevant predictors and/or perform model specification in a flexible manner. Using around one year of daily data, we perform a real-time forecasting exercise and investigate whether any of the proposed models is able to outperform the naive random walk benchmark. To assess the economic relevance of the forecasting gains produced by the proposed models we, moreover, run a simple trading exercise.

TI A Petri Nets Model for Blockchain Analysis
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB A Blockchain is a global shared infrastructure where cryptocurrency transactions among addresses are recorded, validated and made publicly available in a peer-to-peer network. To date, the best known and important cryptocurrency is the bitcoin. In this paper, we focus on this cryptocurrency and in particular on the modeling of the Bitcoin Blockchain by using the Petri Nets formalism. The proposed model allows us to quickly collect information about identities owning Bitcoin addresses and to recover measures and statistics on the Bitcoin network. By exploiting algebraic formalism, we reconstructed an Entities network associated to Blockchain transactions gathering together Bitcoin addresses into the single entity holding permits to manage Bitcoins held by those addresses. The model allows also to identify a set of behaviors typical of Bitcoin owners, like that of using an address only once, and to reconstruct chains for this behavior together with the rate of firing. Our model is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to include different features of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency system.

TI Research on the Selection Strategies of Blockchain Mining Pools
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB Since the increasing popularization of the emerging blockchain technology, blockchain mining has attracted more and more attention. Due to the difficulty of solo mining, typically miners choose to join a mining pool. As there are many mining pools and different mining pools may adopt different reward mechanisms, how to choose the appropriate mining pool has become one of the most important issues faced by miners, since miners can get different rewards in different pools. In practice, there are three commonly used reward mechanisms for the mining pools to distribute the reward among their miners, namely, the proportional mechanism, the pay-per-share mechanism, and the pay-per-last-N-share mechanism. In this paper, we study the pool selection problem faced by the miners, and model it as a risk decision problem since different reward mechanisms have different risks. We establish a pool selection model based on the maximum-likelihood criterion and also study the effect of N on the miners' optimal pool selection decisions. By utilizing the computational experiments approach, we validate our proposed pool selection strategies. Our results can provide important managerial insights for miners when making their pool selection decisions.

AB With the fast development and expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), billions of smart devices are being continuously connected, and smart homes, as a typical IoT application, are providing people with various convenient applications, but face security and privacy issues. The idea of Blockchain (BC) theory has brought about a potential solution to the IoT security problem. The emergence of blockchain technology has brought about a change of decentralized management, providing an effective solution for the protection of network security and privacy. On the other hand, the smart devices in IoT are always lightweight and have less energy and memory. This makes the application of blockchain difficult. Against this background, this paper proposes a blockchain model based on hypergraphs. The aims of this model are to reduce the storage consumption and to solve the additional security issues. In the model, we use the hyperedge as the organization of storage nodes and convert the entire networked data storage into part network storage. We discuss the design of the model and security strategy in detail, introducing some use cases in a smart home network and evaluating the storage performance of the model through simulation experiments and an evaluation of the network.

TI Scalable and Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing Based on Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB With the development of network technology and cloud computing, data sharing is becoming increasingly popular, and many scholars have conducted in-depth research to promote its flourish. As the scale of data sharing expands, its privacy protection has become a hot issue in research. Moreover, in data sharing, the data is usually maintained in multiple parties, which brings new challenges to protect the privacy of these multi-party data. In this paper, we propose a trusted data sharing scheme using blockchain. We use blockchain to prevent the shared data from being tampered, and use the Paillier cryptosystem to realize the confidentiality of the shared data. In the proposed scheme, the shared data can be traded, and the transaction information is protected by using the (p, t)-threshold Paillier cryptosystem. We conduct experiments in cloud storage scenarios and the experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI Bitcoin, crypto-coins, and global anti-money laundering governance
SO CRIME LAW AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Crypto-coins (CCs) like Bitcoin are digitally encrypted tokens traded in peer-to-peer networks whose money laundering potential has attracted the attention of regulators, firms and the wider public worldwide. This article assesses the effectiveness of the global anti-money laundering regime in balancing both the challenges and opportunities presented by these novel 'altcoins'. Two main arguments are advanced. First, the implications that crypto-coins presently pose for global anti-money laundering efforts stem less from the threats of their illicit uses as digital currencies and more from the opportunities presented by their underlying blockchain technologies. Second, despite several shortcomings, the risk-based approach pursued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) strikes an effective balance between the existing threats and opportunities that crypto-coins currently present. Rather than a conclusive evaluation however this article stresses the need for continual monitoring and investigation of the wider ethical implications raised by CCs for global efforts to combat money laundering in an era of rapid technological change.

SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Blockchain acts on a big data analytics because transaction data belongs to streaming data and high-dimensional data from distributed computing network. Accordingly, such operation produces irrelevant data problem and further poorly optimized traceability in blockchain. So, we claim that the artificial intelligence of blockchain mining algorithm like traceability chain algorithm runs faster than consensus algorithm because of inference mechanism. Our main goal is to reach traceability decision not consensus decision as fast as possible. Thus, this article proposes a novelty approach called Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy cognitive maps ANN as traceability chain algorithm. The numerical example of the proposed algorithm in blockchain mining is evaluated and optimized decisions experiment is analyzed. Objective functions for optimized decision computation is described as participant nodes constraint method. Thus contribution succeeds in meeting the reduction mining efforts for the traceability chain being processed. Our findings also provide a preliminary indication of deep learning applied big blockchain transactions data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Due to the centralization of authority in the management of data generated by IoT devices, there is a lack of transparency in how user data is being shared among third party entities. With the popularity of adoption of blockchain technology, which provide decentralized management of assets such as currency as seen in Bitcoin, we propose a decentralized system of data management for IoT devices where all data access permission is enforced using smart contracts and the audit trail of data access is stored in the blockchain. With smart contracts applications, multiple parties can specify rules to govern their interactions which is independently enforced in the blockchain without the need for a centralized system. We provide a framework that store the hash of the data in the blockchain and store the raw data in a secure storage platform using trusted execution environment (TEE). In particular, we consider Intel SGX as a part of TEE that ensure data security and privacy for sensitive part of the application (code and data).

AB Recently, Blockchain is considered as one of the main powerful techniques in security and privacy domains. It is considered as the promised security concept for replacing the current third parities trusting solutions. This could be achieved by mixing some cryptography techniques, consensus algorithms alongside with some peer-to-peer communication protocols. In this paper, to meet the requirement of distributed structure in the eHealth Records (EHRs) system, we propose a novel protocol to achieve a perfect privacy preserving for the patient namely Pseudonym Based Encryption with Different Authorities (PBE-DA) by applying the concept of Blockchain on the healthcare communication entities in an e-health platform. Therefore, PBE-DA will be used to help the patient anonymously to access, check or update his sensitive data on EHRs system. Moreover, we analyzed not only the public blockchain tier between the different EHRs cloud provider but also another Blockchain tier between the patient sensors (IoT devices used to do some patient measurements) and the patient system as a gateway for the whole healthcare platform.

AB Smart home presents a challenge in control and monitoring of its wireless sensors networks (WSN) and the internet of things (IoT) devices which form it. The current IoT architectures are centralized, complex, with poor security in its communications and with upstream communication channels mainly. As a result, there are problems with data reliability. These problems include data missing, malicious data inserted, communications network overload, and overload of computing power at the central node. In this paper a new architecture is presented. This architecture based in blockchain introduce the edge computing layer and a new algorithm to improve data quality and false data detection.

AB Nowadays, the blockchain is a favorite platform, for instance, for use with cryptocurrency, smart contracts, IoT, and so forth. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not trust each other to maintain states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. The blockchain applies the consensus protocol to verify the block which is distributing the network node. Consensus has many practices such as, for example, Byzantine general problem, Proof of work, and Proof of stake. However, there have not been numerous papers that have undertaken analysis with regard to various aspects, and which have incorporated the adoption summary as appropriate to the application. In this paper, we have provided a technical verification review with regard to the consensus algorithm taken from previous research. The audience will receive a consensus protocol, and the algorithm typically analyzes the application to match which platform is appropriate by viewing the node identity, energy saving and the tolerated power of the adversary, the data model, language, execution, application, and examples. Finally, we finish by presenting several research directions with regard to the consensus protocol.

AB One of the biggest challenges for the Internet of Things (IoT) is to bridge the currently fragmented trust domains. The traditional PKI model relies on a common root of trust and does not fit well with the heterogeneous IoT ecosystem where constrained devices belong to independent administrative domains.
   In this work we describe a distributed trust model for the IoT that leverages the existing trust domains and bridges them to create end-to-end trust between IoT devices without relying on any common root of trust. Furthermore we define a new cryptographic primitive, denoted as obligation chain designed as a credit-based Blockchain with a built-in reputation mechanism. Its innovative design enables a wide range of use cases and business models that are simply not possible with current Blockchain-based solutions while not experiencing traditional blockchain delays. We provide a security analysis for both the obligation chain and the overall architecture and provide experimental tests that show its viability and quality.

AB E-government system has greatly improved the efficiency and transparency of daily operations of a government. However, most of existing e-government services are provided in a centralized manner and heavily rely on human individuals to control. The highly centralized IT infrastructure is more vulnerable to outside attacks. Also, it is relatively easy to compromise the data integrity by inside rogue users. Furthermore, relying on individuals to monitor and control some of the working flows makes the system error-prone and leaves room for corruption. To address these challenges, we propose to use the blockchain technology and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to improve the e-government system. The blockchain-based DAO system works in a fully decentralized way and is immune to both outside and inside attacks. At the same time, operations of such system is only controlled by pre-defined rules; thus, the uncertainty and errors caused by human processes are greatly reduced. We provide a concrete use case to demonstrate the usage of DAO e-government and evaluate its effectiveness.

AB Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) are public offers of new cryptocurrencies in exchange of existing ones, aimed to finance projects in the blockchain development arena. In the last 8 months of 2017, the total amount gathered by ICOs exceeded 4 billion US$, and overcame the venture capital funnelled toward high tech initiatives in the same period. A high percentage of ICOs is managed through Smart Contracts running on Ethereum blockchain, and in particular to ERC-20 Token Standard Contract. In this work we examine 1387 ICOs, published on December 31, 2017 on icobench.com website, gathering information relevant to the assessment of their quality and software development management, including data on their development teams. We also study, at the same date, the financial data of 450 ICO tokens available on coinmarketcap.com website, among which 355 tokens are managed on Ethereum blochain. We define success criteria for the ICOs, based on the funds actually gathered, and on the behavior of the price of the related tokens, finding the factors that most likely influence the ICO success likeliness.

TI A New Transitively Closed Undirected Graph Authentication Scheme for
   Blockchain-Based Identity Management Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain can potentially be deployed in a wide range of applications due to its capability to ensure decentralization, transparency, and immutability. In this paper, we design a cryptographic membership authentication scheme (i.e., authenticating graph data) to support blockchain-based identity management systems (BIMS). Such a system is designed to bind a digital identity object to its real-world entity. Specifically, we introduce a new transitively closed undirected graph authentication (TCUGA) scheme, which only needs to use node signatures (e.g., certificates for identifying nodes). The trapdoor hash function used in our scheme allows the signer to efficiently update the certificates without the need to re-sign the nodes. In other words, our scheme is efficient even though the graph dynamically adds or deletes vertices and edges. Moreover, our proposal can efficiently provide a proof when the edge between two vertices does not exist, thus solving the existing intractability issue in transitive signature (the main tool for authenticating graph data). Finally, we prove the security of our proposed TCUGA in the standard model and evaluate its performance to show its feasibility for BIMS.

AB Blockchain is widely deemed as a key enabling technology of current digital currency. However, the application of blockchain to wireless mobile networks is challenged by a computational difficult problem called proof-of-work puzzle. Accordingly, mobile edge computing (MEC) appears to be a promising solution by offloading the computation-intensive mining tasks to nearby edge computing nodes. Meanwhile, caching is also popular due to its capability in handling the ever-increasing Internet traffic. In this paper, we study computation offloading and content caching in wireless blockchain networks with MEC. Specifically, offloading mode selection (offloaded to a nearby access point (AP) or a group of device-to-device (D2D) users) and caching strategy (whether to cache the requested content and computation results or not) are jointly investigated and formulated as an optimization problem. Further, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization problem in a distributed way. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by simulation results with different system parameters.

AB In 2017, the Blockchain-based cryptocurrency market witnessed enormous growth. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, reached all-time highs many times over the year leading to speculations to explain the trend in its growth. In this paper, we study Bitcoin and explore features in its network that explain its price hikes. We gather data and analyze user and network activity that highly impact Bitcoin price. We monitor the change in the activities over time and relate them to economic theories. We identify key network features that determine the demand and supply dynamics of a cryptocurrency. Finally, we use machine learning methods to construct models that predict Bitcoin price. Our regression model predicts Bitcoin price with 99.4% accuracy and 0.0113 root mean squared error (RMSE).

SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB The development of Financial Technology (FinTech) in areas such as mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data, search engines, and blockchain technology have significantly changed the financial industry. FinTech is expected to overturn the traditional banking business model, forcing banks to upgrade and transform. This study adopts a comparative case study method to contrast and analyze the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Citibank. It analyzes the strategies, organizations, HR systems, and product innovations adopted by these two banks in response to the impact of FinTech. This paper proposes an "electric vehicle" mode for ICBC and an "airplane mode" for Citibank. Further, it describes the difficulties encountered by the Chinese banking industry and proposes some feasible ways to upgrade. "Technology power" will become the core competitive concept for the financial institutions of the future.

TI Morphology Reentry with a Change in Degree of Chain Asymmetry in Neat
   Asymmetric Linear A(1)BA(2) Triblock Copolymers
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB We report experimental results on relationship between polymer chain architecture and morphology of microdomains of asymmetric linear triblock copolymers, S1BS2 (S: polystyrene; B: polybutadiene). For this purpose, we synthesized various asymmetric triblock copolymers having different lengths of two end-blocks. The morphology was examined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Although total molecular weight, composition, and thermal annealing temperature were kept constant, the morphology was found to change with a degree of chain asymmetry. One typical example exhibits a morphological change as cylinder lamella cylinder with a decrease in length of the shorter S-2 end-block chains, while keeping the total molecular weight and the total polystyrene composition constant. This curious morphological behavior exhibiting a re-entrant type change is qualitatively in accord with the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) results by Matsen [J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 113, 5539-5544]. This indicates that SCFT results about the morphological phase behavior of block copolymers are useful guides for experiments as long as the preparation of block copolymer samples is precisely controlled. The re-entrant behavior predicted by SCFT for the asymmetric triblock copolymers is attributed to the pull-out of the shorter end-block chains from their preferred microdomain. Namely, when pull-out of the shorter S-2 end-block chains from a S-microdomain takes place, the shorter S-2 end-block chain is solubilized in B-microdomains. As a result, the effective polybutadiene composition is increased. This kind of mechanism, the solubilization of the shorter A(2) end-block chains, may be relevant to the re-entrant type change of morphology with the degree of the chain asymmetry, and it has been experimentally confirmed by the lowering of T-g of the middle blocks and the lowering of the chain mobility of the shorter M-2 end-blocks by the electron spin resonance using spin-labeled M1SM2 (M: poly(methyl acrylate), and the shorter M-2 end-block chains were spin-labeled) specimens. It is confirmed by this study that the architecture asymmetry is an important factor in addition to the composition and the degree of the segregation, impacting the morphological phase behavior of block copolymers.

TI Contact and Deformation of Randomly Rough Surfaces with Varying
   Root-Mean-Square Gradient
SO TRIBOLOGY LETTERS
AB The "Contact Mechanics Challenge" posed to the tribology community by Muser and Dapp in 2015 detailed a 100 mu m x 100 mu m randomly rough surface with a root-meansquare gradient of unity, (g) over bar = 1. Many surfaces, both natural and synthetic, can be described as randomly rough, but rarely with a root-mean-square gradient as steep as (g) over bar = 1. The selection of such a challenging surface parameter was intentional, but potentially limiting for broad comparisons across existing models and theories which may be limited by small-slope approximations. In this manuscript, the root-mean-square gradients ((g) over bar) of the "Contact Mechanics Challenge" surface were produced on 1000 x scaled models such that there were three different surfaces for study with (g) over bar = 0.2, 0.5, and 1. In situ measurements of the real area of contact and contact area distributions were performed using frustrated total internal reflectance along with surface deformation measurements performed using digital image correlation. These optical in situ experiments used the scaled 3D-printed rough surfaces that were loaded into contact with smooth, flat, and elastic samples that were made from unfilled PDMS: (10:1) E* = 2.1 MPa Delta gamma = 4 mJ/m(2); (20:1) E* = 0.75 MPa Delta gamma = 3 mJ/m(2); (30:1) E* = 0.24 MPa Delta gamma = 2 mJ/m(2). All of the loading was performed using a uniaxial load frame under force control. A Green's function molecular dynamics simulation assuming the small-slope approximation was compared to all experimental data. These measurements reveal that decreasing root-mean-square gradient noticeably increases real area of contact area under conditions of "equal" applied load, but variations in the root-mean-square gradient did not significantly alter the contact patch geometry under conditions of nearly equal real area of contact. Including (g) over bar in the reduced pressure (p = P/(E* (g) over bar)) reduced the root-mean-square error between the simulation ((g) over bar = 1) and all experimental data for the relative area of contact as a function of reduced pressure over the entire range of surfaces, materials, and loads tested.

TI Leader Dark Traits, Workplace Bullying, and Employee Depression:
   Exploring Mediation and the Role of the Dark Core
SO JOURNAL OF ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
AB A growing body of empirical evidence now supports a negative association between dark traits in leaders and the psychological health of employees. To date, such investigations have mostly focused on psychopathy, nonspecific measures of psychological wellbeing, and have not considered the mechanisms through which these relationships might operate. In the current study (N = 508), we utilized other-ratings of personality (employees rated leaders' personality), psychometrically robust measures, and sophisticated modeling techniques, to examine whether the effects of leaders' levels of narcissism and psychopathy on employee depression are mediated by workplace bullying. Structural equation models provided clear evidence to suggest that employee perceptions of both leader narcissism and psychopathy are associated with increased workplace bullying (25.8% and 41.0% variance explained, respectively) and that workplace bullying fully mediates the effect of leader narcissism and psychopathy on employee depression (21.5% and 20.8% variance explained, respectively). However, when psychopathy and narcissism were modeled concurrently, narcissism did not explain any variance in bullying, suggesting that it is the overlap between psychopathy and narcissism, namely, the "dark core," which primarily accounts for the observed effects. We examined this assertion empirically and explored the unique effects of the subfactors of psychopathy.
   General Scientific Summary
   Leader psychopathy and narcissism affect employee depression through workplace bullying. Results suggest that the aspects of narcissism related to workplace bullying and employee depression are shared with psychopathy.

TI Intelligent Contracts and the Construction Industry
SO JOURNAL OF LEGAL AFFAIRS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION IN ENGINEERING AND
   CONSTRUCTION
AB Advances in technology have resulted in a fast-changing landscape for construction contracts. Lawyers struggle to keep up with the pace of innovation, the need to provide legal solutions and accommodate new approaches. Building information modeling (BIM) has become part of the common parlance in construction notwithstanding limited evidence of its impact on the ground. Intelligent contracts appear as a logical extension to BIM whereby the contractual performance itself becomes automated. However, intelligent contracts work best where they are short term or are of instantaneous effect. This is at odds with the complicated and long-running nature of construction projects. Further, storage constraints, compatibility, and reliability issues together with confidentiality and the long-term nature of distributed ledgers pose additional problems. This work discusses what could be achieved in the construction industry by the adoption of intelligent contracts. An online forum provided secondary data to give soundings on the issues raised. The objectives are to introduce aspects of technological advancement within commerce generally and to make connections with best practice and limitations within construction. The hypothesis advanced is that certain aspects of the construction contract cannot be fully intelligent and the best that can be achieved in the short to medium term is a semiautomated position. Further, intelligent contracts should be viewed as part of the BIM-led revolution in construction and not separate from it. The recommendation is that incremental advances such as the coding of project management and contract administration data be targeted to provide improved operational efficiency and value savings.

TI On a fractional order calculus model in diffusion weighted breast
   imaging to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions
   detected on X-ray screening mammography
SO PLOS ONE
AB Objective
   To evaluate a fractional order calculus (FROC) model in diffusion weighted imaging to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions in breast cancer screening work-up using recently introduced parameters (a FROC, DFROC and ae FROC).
   Materials and methods
   This retrospective analysis within a prospective IRB-approved study included 51 participants (mean 58.4 years) after written informed consent. All patients had suspicious screening mammograms and indication for biopsy. Prior to biopsy, full diagnostic contrastenhanced MRI examination was acquired including diffusion-weighted-imaging (DWI, b = 0,100,750,1500 s/mm(2)). Conventional apparent diffusion coefficient D-app and FROC parameters (beta(FROC), D-FROC and mu(FROC)) as suggested further indicators of diffusivity components were measured in benign and malignant lesions. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the parameters.
   Results
   29/51 patients histopathologically revealed malignant lesions. The analysis revealed an AUC for Dapp of 0.89 (95% CI 0.80 - 0.98). For FROC derived parameters, AUC was 0.75 (0.60 -0.89) for DFROC, 0.59 (0.43 - 0.75) for alpha FROC and 0.59 (0.42 - 0.77) for mu(FROC). Comparison of the AUC curves revealed a significantly higher AUC of Dapp compared to the FROC parameters D-FROC (p = 0.009), beta(FROC) (p = 0.003) and mu(FROC) (p = 0.001).
   Conclusion
   In contrast to recent description in brain tumors, the apparent diffusion coefficient D-app showed a significantly higher AUC than the recently proposed FROC parameters beta(FROC), D-FROC and mu(FROC) for differentiating between malignant and benign breast lesions. This might be related to the intrinsic high heterogeneity within breast tissue or to the lower maximal b-value used in our study.

AB Cloud federations are a new collaboration paradigm where organizations share data across their private cloud infrastructures. However, the adoption of cloud federations is hindered by federated organizations' concerns on potential risks of data leakage and data misuse. For cloud federations to be viable, federated organizations' privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose a novel identity and access management system for cloud federations. The system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes to the federated organization owning data. The system also guarantees the integrity of the policy evaluation process by using blockchain technology and Intel SGX trusted hardware. It uses blockchain to ensure that users identity attributes and access control policies cannot be modified by a malicious user, while Intel SGX protects the integrity and confidentiality of the policy enforcement process. We present the access control protocol, the system architecture and discuss future extensions.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a revolution in the number of connected devices. Cisco reported that there were 25 billion IoT devices in 2015 and modest estimation that this number will almost double by 2020. Society has become dependent on these billions of devices, devices that are connected and communicating with each other all the time with information constantly share between users, services, and internet providers.
   The emergent IoT devices as a technology are creating a huge security rift between users and usability, sacrificing usability for security created a number of major issues. First, IoT devices are classified under Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) that blows any organization security boundary and make them a target for espionage or tracking. Second, the size of the data generated from IoT makes big data problems pale in comparison not to mention IoT devices need a real-time response. Third, is incorporating secure access and control for IoT devices ranging from edge nodes devices to application level (business intelligence reporting tools) is a challenge because it has to account for several hardware and application levels. Establishing a secure access control model between different IoT devices and services is a major milestone for the IoT. This is important because data leakage and unauthorized access to data have a high impact on our IoT devices. However, traditional access control models with the static and rigid infrastructure cannot provide the required security for the IoT infrastructure.
   Therefore, this paper proposes a risk-based access control model for IoT technology that takes into account real-time data information request for IoT devices and gives dynamic feedback. The proposed model uses IoT environment features to estimate the security risk associated with each access request using user context, resource sensitivity, action severity and risk history as inputs for security risk estimation algorithm that is responsible for access decision. Then the proposed model uses smart contracts to provide adaptive features in which the user behaviour is monitored to detect any abnormal actions from authorized users.

AB Permissionless blockchain-based cryptocurrencies commonly use proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) to ensure their security, e.g. to prevent double spending attacks. However, both approaches have disadvantages: PoW leads to massive amounts of wasted electricity and re-centralization, whereas major stakeholders in PoS might be able to create a monopoly. In this work, we propose proof-of-personhood (PoP), a mechanism that binds physical entities to virtual identities in a way that enables accountability while preserving anonymity. Afterwards we introduce PoPCoin, a new cryptocurrency, whose consensus mechanism leverages PoP to eliminate the disadvantages of PoW and PoS while ensuring security. PoPCoin leads to a continuously fair and democratic wealth creation process which paves the way for an experimental basic income infrastructure.

AB Blockchains and more general distributed ledgers are becoming increasingly popular as efficient, reliable, and persistent records of data and transactions. Unfortunately, they ensure reliability and correctness by making all data public, raising confidentiality concerns that eliminate many potential uses.
   In this paper we present Solidus, a protocol for confidential transactions on public blockchains, such as those required for asset transfers with on-chain settlement. Solidus operates in a framework based on real-world financial institutions: a modest number of banks each maintain a large number of user accounts. Within this framework, Solidus hides both transaction values and the transaction graph (i.e., the identities of transacting entities) while maintaining the public verifiability that makes blockchains so appealing. To achieve strong confidentiality of this kind, we introduce the concept of a Publicly-Verifiable Oblivious RAM Machine (PVORM). We present a set of formal security definitions for both PVORM and Solidus and show that our constructions are secure. Finally, we implement Solidus and present a set of benchmarks indicating that the system is efficient in practice.

TI Cryptocurrencies as market singularities: the strange case of Bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB Since its creation in 2009, the electronic currency Bitcoin has generated volumes of online debate in the business press. While there have been plenty of economic arguments situating it as a financial bubble about to collapse including from Nobel Prize winning economists, its price value has proven to be more durable than many have predicted. To explain this durability, Karpik's conception of market singularities is used to understand the Bitcoin phenomenon by outlining the beliefs that maintain Bitcoin's status as a volatile financial asset. Market singularities are markets for particular kinds of goods and services that are of uncertain and incommensurable value. Singularities markets have communities of followers and a distinctive belief system that ascribes value to a particular product, service, or asset. Developing Karpik's conception, the paper explores the libertarian political belief system that surrounds Bitcoin's status as a financial asset. I also outline some political tensions within the electronic currency community concerning governance and centralisation.

TI Bitcoin Mining as a Contest
SO LEDGER
AB This paper presents a simple game theoretic framework, assuming complete information, to model Bitcoin mining activity. It does so by formalizing the activity as an all-pay contest: a competition where participants contend with each other to win a prize by investing in computational power, and victory is probabilistic. With at least two active miners, the unique pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game suggests the following interesting insights on the motivation for being a miner: while the optimal amount of energy consumption depends also on the reward for solving the puzzle, as long as the reward is positive the decision to be an active miner depends only on the mining costs. Moreover, the intrinsic structure of the mining activity seems to prevent the formation of a monopoly, because in an equilibrium with two miners, both of them will have positive expected profits for any level of the opponent's costs. A monopoly could only form if the rate of return on investment were higher outside bitcoin.

AB In the Bitcoin system, a peer-to-peer electronic currency system, the delay overhead in transaction verification prevents the Bitcoin from gaining increasing popularity nowadays as it makes the system vulnerable to double spend attacks. This paper introduces a proximity-aware extension to the current Bitcoin protocol, named Bitcoin Clustering Based Ping Time protocol (BCBPT). The ultimate purpose of the proposed protocol, that is based on how the clusters are formulated and the nodes define their membership, is to improve the transaction propagation delay in the Bitcoin network. In BCBPT, the proximity of connectivity in the Bitcoin network is increased by grouping Bitcoin nodes based on ping latencies between nodes. We show, through simulations, that the proximity base ping latency defines better clustering structures that optimize the performance of the transaction propagation delay. The reduction of the communication link cost measured by the information propagation time between nodes is mainly considered as a key reason for this improvement. Bitcoin Clustering Based Ping Time protocol is more effective at reducing the transaction propagation delay compared to the existing clustering protocol (LBC) that we proposed in our previous work.

AB Blockchain, or distributed ledger, provides a way to build various decentralized systems without relying on any single trusted party. This is especially attractive for smart contracts, that different parties do not need to trust each other to have a contract, and the distributed ledger can guarantee correct execution of the contract. Most existing distributed ledger based smart contract systems process smart contracts in a serial manner, i.e., all users have to run a contract before its result can be accepted by the system. Although this approach is easy to implement and manage, it is not scalable and greatly limits the system's capability of handling a large number of smart contracts. In order to address this problem, we propose a scalable smart contract execution scheme that can run multiple smart contract in parallel to improve throughput of the system. Our scheme relies on two key techniques: a fair contract partition algorithm leveraging integer linear programming to partition a set of smart contracts into multiple subsets, and a random assignment protocol assigning subsets randomly to a subgroup of users. We prove that, our scheme is secure as long as more than 50% of the computational power is possessed by honest nodes. We then conduct experiments with data from existing smart contract system to evaluate the efficiency of our scheme. The results demonstrate that our approach is scalable and much more efficient than the existing smart contract platform.

AB Bitcoin's innovative and distributedly maintained blockchain data structure hinges on the adequate degree of difficulty of so-called "proofs of work," which miners have to produce in order for transactions to be inserted. Importantly, these proofs of work have to be hard enough so that miners have an opportunity to unify their views in the presence of an adversary who interferes but has bounded computational power, but easy enough to be solvable regularly and enable the miners to make progress. As such, as the miners' population evolves over time, so should the difficulty of these proofs. Bitcoin provides this adjustment mechanism, with empirical evidence of a constant block generation rate against such population changes.
   In this paper we provide the first formal analysis of Bitcoin's target (re) calculation function in the cryptographic setting, i.e., against all possible adversaries aiming to subvert the protocol's properties. We extend the q-bounded synchronous model of the Bitcoin backbone protocol [Eurocrypt 2015], which posed the basic properties of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain data structure and shows how a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them, to environments that may introduce or suspend parties in each round.
   We provide a set of necessary conditions with respect to the way the population evolves under which the "Bitcoin backbone with chains of variable difficulty" provides a robust transaction ledger in the presence of an actively malicious adversary controlling a fraction of the miners strictly below 50% at each instant of the execution. Our work introduces new analysis techniques and tools to the area of blockchain systems that may prove useful in analyzing other blockchain protocols.

AB Affordable and reliable supply chain visibility is becoming increasingly important as the complexity of the network underlying supply chains is becoming orders of magnitudes higher compared to a decade ago. Moreover, this increase in complexity is starting to reflect on the cost of goods and their availability to the consumers. This paper addresses two key issues in the distribution phase of the supply chain, namely, affordability and pseudo real-time visibility of truckload activities. The proposed framework creates a digital thread that tracks the pseudo real-time status of the shipment making the physical distribution process completely transparent to the stakeholders. The architecture of the framework is based on a dynamic hybrid peer-to-peer network and a private/public blockchain data model that leverages emergent sensor technologies.

AB Among the smart cities applications, optimizing lottery games is one of the urgent needs to ensure their fairness and transparency. The emerging blockchain technology shows a glimpse of solutions to fairness and transparency issues faced by lottery industries. This paper presents the design of a blockchain-based lottery system for smart cities applications. We adopt the smart contracts of blockchain technology and the cryptograph blockchain model, Hawk [8], to design the blockchain-based lottery system, FairLotto, for future smart cities applications. Fairness, transparency, and privacy of the proposed blockchain-based lottery system are discussed and ensured.

AB Increasing production personalization demand requires manufacturing enterprises to gain higher flexibility and faster market response. Enterprises have to share their manufacturing resources and cooperate with each other to win out in the fierce market competition. Under the circumstances, Social Manufacturing (SocialM) mode is proposed. In this mode, Social Manufacturing Network (SMN) integrates distributed Socialized Manufacturing Resources (SMRs) to provide more precise and professional service for customers. As a decentralized network, SMN cannot ensure the cross-enterprise collaborations because there is no trusted third party as supervisor. In this paper, a blockchain-based Production Credit Mechanism (PCM) for manufacturing services is put forward to regulate the cross-enterprise collaborations among SMRs. The frame and concept of PCM are firstly given followed by four key enabling technologies supporting the implementation of the mechanism. It is expected that the PCM proposed in this paper will provide a possible way to normalize and regulate cross-enterprise collaborations under social manufacturing mode.

AB A blockchain powered Health information ecosystem can solve a frequently discussed problem of the lifelong recorded patient health data, which seriously could hurdle the privacy of the patients and the growing data hunger of the research and policy maker institutions. On one side the general availability of the data is vital in emergency situations and supports heavily the different research, population health management and development activities, on the other side using the same data can lead to serious social and ethical problems caused by malicious actors. Currently, the regulation of the privacy data varies all over the world, however underlying principles are always defensive and protective towards patient privacy against general availability. The protective principles cause a defensive, data hiding attitude of the health system developers to avoid breaching the overall law regulations. It makes the policy makers and different - primarily drug developers to find ways to treat data such a way that lead to ethical and political debates. In our paper we introduce how the blockchain technology can help solving the problem of secure data storing and ensuring data availability at the same time. We use the basic principles of the American HIPAA regulation, which defines the public availability criteria of health data, however the different local regulations may differ significantly. Blockchain's decentralized, intermediary-free, cryptographically secured attributes offer a new way of storing patient data securely and at the same time publicly available in a regulated way, where a well-designed distributed peer-to-peer network incentivize the smooth operation of a full-featured EHR system

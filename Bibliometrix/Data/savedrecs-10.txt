TI A Social-Network-Based Cryptocurrency Wallet-Management Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Effective cryptocurrency key management has become an urgent requirement for modern cryptocurrency. Although a large body of cryptocurrency wallet-management schemes has been proposed, they are mostly constructed for specific application scenarios and often suffer from weak security. In this paper, we propose a more effective, usable, and secure cryptocurrency wallet-management system based on semi-trusted social networks, therein allowing users to collaborate with involved parties to achieve some powerful functions and recovery under certain circumstances. Furthermore, we employ an identity-based hierarchical key-insulated encryption scheme to achieve time-sharing authorization and present a semi-trusted portable social-network-based wallet-management scheme that provides the features of security-enhanced storage, portable login on different devices, no-password authentication, flexible key delegation, and so on. The performance analysis shows that our proposed schemes require minimal additional overhead and have low time delays, making them sufficiently efficient for real-world deployment.

AB Blockchain technology has been increasingly used for decentralizing cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) architectures to address some limitations faced by centralized systems. While many existing efforts are successful in leveraging blockchain for decentralization with multiple servers (full nodes) to handle faulty nodes, an important issue has arisen that external clients (also called lightweight clients) have to rely on a relay node to communicate with the full nodes in the blockchain. Compromization of such relay nodes may result in a security breach and even a blockage of IoT sensors from the network. We propose censorship resistant decentralized IoT management systems, which include a "diffusion" function to deliver all messages from sensors to all full nodes and an augmented consensus protocol to check data loss, replicate processing outcome, and facilitate opportunistic outcome delivery. We also leverage the cryptographic tool of aggregate signature to reduce the complexity of communication and signature verification.

AB According to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), the medical insurance claim process is carried out by healthcare providers, insurance companies, and clearinghouses. The clearinghouse coordinates the medical insurance claims between providers and insurance companies. As centralized communication hubs, clearinghouses may maliciously or unintentionally leak patient information. In this work, we propose a distributed solution to replace the role of clearinghouses during health insurance claim process and mitigate the risk of data leakage among parties in Healthcare sector. Our solution enhances the patients' privacy protection through developing a HIPAA compliance system for the medical insurance claim process in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. Blockchain ensures transaction integrity and anonymity of cryptocurrencies by using distributed immutable ledgers. We first design data structures for patient information, medical service record, insurance payment, and insurance agreements within the ledger. We then focus on defining smart contracts for privacy assurance, as well as automating the insurance claim process. We implement and evaluate the proposed framework with Hyperledger Fabric, showing promising performance and response time.

AB Complexity in automotive electrics/electronics development increases steadily due to new technologies, e.g. autonomous driving. Knowledge and hence development is more distributed among equal engineering partners and suppliers who become more and might join ad hoc, e.g. a start-up provides a new software faster and cheaper. Development artifacts have to be reconciled and traceability between E/E systems and their components has to be ensured to avoid errors, incompatibilities, and high coordination effort. Model -based systems engineering (MBSE) starts early in the development process by defining formal models which link and trace all system elements. However, there still is a gap between MBSE and later product data and lifecycle management (PD1VI/PLM) because these disciplines have different meta models. This paper presents a framework, methodologically and technologically, to bridge this gap. Therefore, the Blockchain technology provides valuable mechanisms for engineering collaboration. MBSE methodologies are assessed, aligned with PDM/PLM, and prototypically implemented.

AB The purpose of the research paper is to describe how the Blockchain technology can foster traceability of electric/electronics (E/E) information artifacts in product lifecycle management (PLM) with a focus on bridging the gap between model-bases systems engineering (MBSE) and product data management (PDM). Due to automotive development includes many parties, such as original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), suppliers, and new partners, a distribution mechanism for proclamation of changed information artifacts is necessary. The approach compares MBSE methods and identifies which information artifacts created there have to be linked with PDM artifacts. Practical implications for the exchange of data in engineering collaboration with multiple partners are assessed by a first proof of concept with a Blockchain prototype tested with a supplier. The originality of this approach stems from the application of the Blockchain technology in engineering IT, a meta data model to connect MBSE and PDM, and the facilitated inclusion of engineering collaboration partners by those means.

AB Mass application of blockchain technology is becoming reality. Adopting blockchain to enterprise network is innovative approach. It brings novel solution for increasing network security and improved efficiency of network maintenance. Key feature of blockchain is storing data securely in encrypted chains of blocks. It is a distributed database processing continuously growing list of transactions. This feature makes blockchain extremely resistant to unauthorized modifications of stored data. Application of blockchain for network monitoring and management facilitates secure and distributed medium for configuration of network nodes. Furthermore, all modifications in configuration of devices are traceable in blockchain and configuration recovery after incident is rather simple and transparent.
   In this paper we introduce architecture for monitoring and managing enterprise networks through private blockchain. Using blockchain, any change is attributable to administrator as in traditional network management with AAA implemented, but in addition rollback to previous configuration is simple. Using blockchain instead of traditional network management approaches built on database, distributed nature of blockchain removes single point of failure and simplify management of distributed networks.
   Our solution utilizes blockchain for secure dissemination of configuration changes to network nodes. Proof of concept of our solution was validated with Hyperledger Composer in our Cisco Lab.

AB We develop EthernityDB, a system that integrates database functionality into an Ethereum blockchain. In contrast to other systems, in our approach all the data is kept on the chain, giving us all the guarantees of a blockchain in terms of consistency, immutability, and security. Mapping the database functionality onto Ethereum's smart contracts is not a straightforward process: by modularizing the code in certain ways, we can bring down the transaction cost considerably. In a experimental evaluation we illustrate various trade-offs, measuring these transaction costs, and also discuss building blockchain-based data storage in a more general context.

AB A typical analytical lifecycle in data science projects starts with the process of data generation and collection, continues with data preparation and preprocessing and heads towards project specific analytics, visualizations and presentations. In order to ensure high quality trusted analytics, every relevant step of the data-model-result linkage needs to meet certain quality standards that furthermore should be certified by trusted quality gate mechanisms.
   We propose "blockchain-backed analytics", a scalable and easy-to-use generic approach to introduce quality gates to data science projects, backed by the immutable records of a blockchain. For that reason, data, models and results are stored as cryptographically hashed fingerprints with mutually linked transactions in a public blockchain database.
   This approach enables stakeholders of data science projects to track and trace the linkage of data, applied models and modeling results without the need of trust validation of escrow systems or any other third party.

AB As one of the most successful Blockchain systems, Bitcoin evolved over the past 8 years. The collaborative contribution of its online software development community gradually shaped the functionality and performance of Bitcoin. To date, most discussions around Bitcoin are from technologies underlying the product, as well as market applications. There are very few studies on the development and evolution processes of the Bitcoin software. It is important to investigate on such developmental issues, in order to better understand the development methodologies and lessons learnt from such a spearheaded Blockchain system. This paper serves this purpose by examining the issues data extracted from the Bitcoin GitHub repository from 2011 to 2018. It reports the trends of the major development issues from a longitude perspective. The main results include: 1) the average lifespan of an issue in Bitcoin issue repository is approximately 57 days; and 2) the Top-7 issue types including refactoring, tests, doe, RPC.REST.ZMQ, GUI, bugs, and wallet, accounting for 64.3% of all issues; 3) topic modeling techniques are beneficial in mining popularity and evolution of key issue topics and most problematic architecture components. Using data analysis and visualization techniques. this paper suggests the insights for significant development decisions such as better managing issue repository and strategic allocating of bug resolution effort.

They are often expected to cause "disruptive" changes to the energy industry, implicating they might totally replace current market structures and render today's energy system obsolete. In order to evaluate the actual potential, several specific use cases from different fields are examined here. The potential impact is estimated based on the market value of the respective market segment, which allows assessing the prospective effect. The analyses show that some use cases do have potential to improve current processes and thus, to change the market setting, but these changes are expected to be relatively small. Therefore, blockchain technology is not expected to be disruptive regarding the energy industry, but to complement the structures and processes which are already in place.

AB Nowadays, a combination between Internet of Things (IoT) technology and remote healthcare system is extensively researched due to its efficiency and convenience for human life. When the number of IoT devices in health care system is increased exponentially, the privacy and security issues of patients are becoming a concern. In order to protect personal and device-generated information, we propose to use blockchain-based smart contracts for managing patients' information and medical devices. In detail, using blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we create a remote healthcare system including healthcare provider (such as hospital), healthcare professionals (doctors) and patients. Health condition of patients is measured by sensors and such information is written into blockchain automatically. In addition, we propose a processing mechanism to store the medical device information efficiently and sparingly in accordance with health situation of patient. Concretely, we filter the data from sensors before deciding whether to write data into blockchain or not. Doing so we can reduce the size of blockchain as well as save amount of coins for transaction efficiently. However, the abnormal data from sensors will be written to blockchain immediately and trigger an emergency contact to doctor and hospital for on-time treatment. We have verified the proposed smart contract on Ethereum test environment called TESTRPC and implemented the system on an experimental environment with real devices. This system works well at small scale.

AB Recently, we have witnessed a trend that many industries are forming consortiums and attempting to accelerate efficiency and reduce cost by using blockchain technology. Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industryscale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.

AB Public key server is a simple yet effective way of key management in secure end-to-end communication. To ensure the trustworthiness of a public key server, CONIKS employs a tamper-evident data structure on the server and a gossiping protocol among clients in order to detect compromised servers. However, due to lack of incentive and vulnerability to malicious clients, a gossiping protocol is hard to implement in practice. Meanwhile, alternative solutions such as EthIKS are too costly. This paper presents Trusternity, an auditing scheme relying on Ethereum blockchain that is easy to implement, inexpensive to operate and resilient to malicious clients. We also conduct an empirical study of system behaviour in face of attacks and propose a lightweight anomaly detection algorithm to protect clients against such attacks.

AB Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralized and distributed environment in which transactions and data are not controlled by a central authority. Simultaneously transactions are secure, ubiquitous and trustworthy due to the used cryptographic principles. In this paper, we present a global decentralized blockchain-based platform and ecosystem called EduCTX. The platform enables managing, assigning and presenting credentials for individuals and educational institutions as well as other potential stakeholders such as companies, institutions and organizations. Further it enables the development of own digital services, which offers organizations the opportunity to automate the evaluation of individuals' skills and knowledge. The EduCTX platform is implemented on the blockchain platform Ethereum on a consortium-based network of Ethereum run nodes. The platform enables a globally efficient, simplified and ubiquitous environment to avoid language and administrative barriers.

AB With the price of Bitcoin ascending to new heights in 2017, the rocketing valuation of cryptocurrencies continues its momentum into 2018. Evidence of the massive growth of these digital assets can be seen in the massive spikes in new clients at companies like Coinbase, adding 100,000 users in a 24-hour period, and Binance, which recently expanded its user base by 240,000 users in just one hour.
   The financial industry and Silicon Valley are not the only groups who have caught the cryptocurrency fever. Malicious actors have discovered that cryptocurrency newbies are unwitting targets that offer a consistent stream of revenue. Through our global network visibility, Cisco has observed many of these attacks originating from bulletproof hosting infrastructures located in the Eastern European region. This area is a hotbed for crypto theft and other computer crimes such as ransomware, botnets, DDoS services and credit card fraud. Some criminals have even extended beyond the digital world by kidnapping and demanding ransoms in Bitcoin, such as the case in the reported kidnapping and ransom of Pavel Lerner. Lerner was a lead analyst at Ukraine-based digital currency exchange, Exmo, who was released by his kidnappers after a $1 million Bitcoin payment was made. The event illustrates the desperate lengths some criminals will go in order to steal cryptocurrency.
   Joining the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in 2017, Cisco is committed to protecting these new crypto technologies. Over the past year Cisco researchers have teamed up with the Ukraine Cyber Police to track a Bitcoin phishing operation dubbed the "Coinhoarder" campaign that has been tied to the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
   Credential phishing continues to be one of the biggest security challenges for internet users, and cryptocurrency phishers have found it to be a very lucrative form of attack. In 2017, Chainalysis reported Ethereum phishing as being the number one source of theft in that ecosystem with estimates placing the total amount stolen at $115 million. Google also recently published a research paper stating credential phishing is one of their top security challenges. Cisco has been proactive in detecting phishing domains in predictive fashion to help protect our customers. Additionally, we have been working with security personnel at top cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, such as Blockchain. info and Coinbase, to help protect the cryptocurrency community members from having their tokens stolen.

AB In this article, we analyze a dual currency regime with fiat currency and digital currency and investigate potential crowding-out effects of fiat currency or digital currency under the framework of the traditional monetary economic model. We find that crowding out occurs only under extreme assumptions, i.e., extremely high costs associated with the use (medium of exchange and store of value) of one currency and extremely low costs associated with the use of the other currency.

AB Bitcoin mixing services improve anonymity by breaking the connection between Bitcoin addresses. In the darkweb environment, many illegal trades, such as in drugs or child pornography, avoid their transactions being traced by exploiting mixing services. Therefore, de-mixing algorithms are needed to identify illegal financial flows and to reduce criminal activity. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, few studies on analyzing mixing services and de-anonymizing transactions have been proposed.
   In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of real-world mixing services, and propose a de-mixing algorithm for Helix, one of the most widely used Bitcoin mixing services. The proposed algorithm de-anonymizes the relationship between the input and output addresses of mixing services by exploiting the static and dynamic parameters of mixing services. Our experiment showed that, we could identify the relationships between the input and output addresses of the Helix mixing service with a 99.14% accuracy rate.

AB The increased deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will make them targets for attacks. IoT devices can also be used as tools for committing crimes. In this regard, we propose FIF-IoT-a forensic investigation framework using a public digital ledger to find facts in criminal incidents in IoT-based systems. FIF-IoT collects interactions that take place among various IoT entities (clouds, users, and IoT devices) as evidence and store them securely as transactions in a public, distributed and decentralized blockchain network which is similar to the Bitcoin network. Hence, FIF-IoT eliminates a single entity's control over the evidence storage, avoids single-point-of-failure on the storage media, and ensures high availability of evidence. FIF-IoT presents a framework that ensures integrity, confidentiality, anonymity, and non-repudiation of the evidence stored in the public digital ledger. Furthermore, FIF-IoT provides a mechanism to acquire evidence from the ledger and to verify the integrity of the obtained evidence. We present a case study of a forensic investigation to demonstrate that FIF-IoT is secure against evidence tampering. We also implement a prototype to evaluate the performance of FIF-IoT.

AB Blockchain and smart contract provide a convenient vehicle to build decentralize applications. Among varies Decenrtalized applications (DAPPs), exchange is one of the most mentioned ones. To fully-decentralized an exchange looks somehow like an utopia. Most works tried to use different methods to solve different problems on this subject. According to our observations, the problems caused by blockchain include 1) Long confirmation time, 2) Vulnerable to front running attack, 3) wasting on-chain resource, all these problems make a blockchain based exchange not user friendly. To deal with the above-mentioned problems, a hybrid centralized and decentralized exchange is presented in this work. By simulating the transaction execution processes and eliminating all the unwanted uncertainties, we are confident that the transactions in the proposed exchange center (EC) will be confirmed and executed well on the blockchain, that is, our system allows users to conclude their trades without need of waiting for a long blockchain confirmation time. In conclusion, a Hybrid Centralized and Decentralized Application (HCDAPP) provides a better-quality service, just like a centralized server; at the same time, it also provides a higher-level security, like a decentralized smart contract.

AB New Retail has recently become one of the hottest concepts in the world, particularly in China. Many Internet technologies like Cloud Computing have been employed to address the limitations of the traditional retail industry, and significant progress has been made towards this direction. Despite these achievements, an intractable issue faced by the existing cloud-based retail POS systems is that they cannot provide continuous services when the Internet connections are interrupted. Towards this issue, in this paper, we leverage two new technologies, Blockchain and Edge Computing, to design and develop a new robust retail POS system. More specifically, this type of POS systems deployed in a retail store can use blockchain networking, trustworthiness, and security. We take all cash registers as nodes to build a POS blockchain network and store transaction records in the blockchain network to deal with unexpected network interruptions. Once the Internet connection recovers, a node in the blockchain network will be selected as a POS edge computing server to synchronize data with the POS cloud and resume regular communication between them. The advantages of the robust retail POS system over traditional POS systems include less dependency on the Internet in case of sudden interruptions and little or no hands-on intervention required for changes in our POS system caused by external changes.

AB The logging system records the logs generated by the software so that the administrator can handle the problems that occur. However, the traditional log system is not secure enough and the stored logs are easily falsified. As a decentralized distributed storage technology, the blockchain can ensure that the blockchain network works normally in the presence of a few malicious nodes or failed nodes. So we use the blockchain to store the logs, which improves the security of the log system. In order to improve the performance of the blockchain, we use a voting-based consensus algorithm as a blockchain consistency protocol. This article introduces the architecture and implementation of the log system and verifies the feasibility of the system through experiments.

AB Crowd-sensing systems have gained considerable interests and adoption in recent years. However, most existing crowd-sensing systems rely on central servers, which are subject to low reliability due to the traditional centralized architecture and high service fee. Motivated by constructing a crowd-sensing system with security and low service fee, we propose a blockchain-based crowd-sensing system (BCS), which replaces traditional triangle architecture by decentralized blockchain system. Also, in order to accelerate the formation of the fabric of trust, BCS implements applications of smart contracts to reward sensing-task workers, which offers reliable anonymity in the meantime. By leveraging blockchain technology, BCS has good performance in privacy protection and system robustness.

AB In data sharing schemes, the file owners should obtain rewards by sharing files with others as they put energy in these files. Therefore, we proposed an incentive data sharing scheme in this paper which encourages users to share data and also supports customization. Customization allows the owners to decide the threshold of access, the importance of each attributive classification which determines users' priority level of file modification and file ownership obtaining when the original owner leaves according to the priority level value. To support a convincing customized data sharing scheme, we introduce the knowledge of blockchain and construct a suitable access structure based on weighted attributes. The blockchain is used to ensure the fairness in incentive. Based on weighted attributes, an attribute set is disposed to a numerical value and the owner of the attribute set is able to obtain the file when the value is not less than the threshold, which is different from the normal access control policy. We prove the security from integrity, privacy and the availability of access key. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated at the end of this paper.

AB Drug traceability system is essentially important for public drug security and business of pharmaceutical companies, which aims to track or trace where the drug has been and where it has gone along the drug supply chain. Traditional centralized server-client technical solutions have been far from satisfying for their bad performances in data authenticity, privacy, system resilience and flexibility.
   In this paper, we propose a scenario-oriented blockchain system for drug traceability and regulation called Drugledger, which reconstructs the whole service architecture by separating service provider into three independent service components and ensures the authenticity and privacy of traceability data. Drugledger is more resilient than traditional solutions with its p2p architecture. Furthermore, Drugledger could efficiently prune its storage, achieving a finally stable and acceptable blockchain storage. Besides, algorithms reflecting the real drug supply chain logic (e.g. package, repackage, unpackage, etc.) are designed based on the expanded UTXO workflow in Drugledger. To our knowledge, it is the first systematic work from both a technical and practical perspective on how blockchain system could be designed for drug traceability and regulation.

AB Money is a recognised factor in creating sustainable, affluent societies. Yet, the neoclassical orthodoxy that prevails in our economic thinking remains as a contested area, its supporters claiming their results to be objectively true while many economists outside of the neoclassical domain claim the whole system to stand on clay feet. Of late, the increased activity around complementary currencies suggest that the fiat money zeitgeist might be giving away to more variety in monetary system. New technologies, including blockchain and smart ledger technology, are able to support the use of shared and "open" financial accounting, to individuals and institutions alike. The transparency of financial data could lead the public towards greater understanding of the financial systems, thereby empowering them in their financial decision making. Alongside of specialists and decision makers' capabilities, our project most pressingly calls for engaging the public into the process early on. Multidisciplinary competencies and academic collaboration are needed to take relevant action to investigate, imagine, and to foster novel ways for value creation. For this, we are forming the Aalto Observatory on Digital Valuation Systems, and proposing a series of empirical experiments, entailing a search for deeper understandings of functions in monetary systems.

AB Selfish nodes can collapse autonomous distributed network systems, such as ad hoc network systems or peer-to-peer network systems. In our previous work [1], [2], we proposed an autonomous distributed collaborative messaging system model utilizing blockchain technology. An intermediate node obtains tokens of sending a message like a postage stamp if the node relays a message which is not from the node neither to the node. We revealed that communication by multiple relaying nodes can be executed, and selfish node cannot commit fraud. In this paper, we evaluate our proposed method to reveal its effectiveness.

AB This paper proposes a framework for collaborative anomaly detection on Blockchain. Taking condition-based management of industrial asset as a practical example, we extend the notion of Smart Contract, which has been implicitly assumed to be deterministic, to be able to handle noisy sensor data. By formalizing the task of collaborative anomaly detection as that of multi-task probabilistic dictionary learning, we show that major technical issues of validation, consensus building, and data privacy are naturally addressed within a statistical machine learning algorithm. We envision Blockchain as a platform for collaborative learning rather than just a traceable, immutable, and decentralized data management system, suggesting the direction towards "Blockchain 3.0".

AB Internet advertising is facing increasing challenges, whichforces companies and brands to raise awareness of the importance of the userexperience. Aggravating advertising circumstances are represented by omnipresent fraudulent campaign execution reports, high consumer disapproval for current internet advertising models, various types of hacker attacks through internet ads, and the like. All this entails distrust of the company by the quality, reach and influence of advertising on the internet.
   This paper will show the way of online marketing analytics presentation that was conducted in one Slavonian informative internet portal. In addition, it will show the issues arising from creating an analytics of running campaign that would be more transparent, clearer and simpler to measure.
   The research methodology consists of: (1) analysing the collected transactional data from an ad server, and (2) analysing the amount of data transferred regarding the displayed ads. This analysis is designed to study the proportion of useful content for a user with respect to marketing related content and the content that reduces the quality of overall user experience.
   Conclusion of data analysis shows that the current technology on which the advertising industry is based, faces increasing problems. Tosolve these problems, it is necessary to significantly change the way the user perceives advertising and to take advantage of other technologies and manage user attention.
   Keeping in mind the problems mentioned above, the vision and opportunities of online marketing will be highlighted with an emphasis on blockchain technology. Blockchain, a new technology known as the basis for the development of crypto currencies, also offers many other innovative solutions and services with added value in all industries, including marketing. Blockchain has the technological potential to decentralize existing advertising patterns, from which users (consumers), publishers (authors, content creators, influencers) and advertisers (brands) can benefit.
   The paper will show the effects of blockchain technology on online advertising processes and the expected models of further development of advertising and marketing industries based on distributed applications and innovative solutions offered by this technology.

AB In recent years, blockchain technology has become widespread, and there are now many related open source blockchain projects and services around the world. However, although blockchain are based on decentralized mechanisms, the permission management of current systems is privileged and can only be accessed by users with "admin" authority, who (in turn) manage all of the general users. Therefore, current blockchain structures are not ideal because most users cannot take full advantage of their features, and current access control methods cannot safeguard against compromised admins. With those points in mind, this paper proposes a novel method for decentralized authority management in blockchain that is based on Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws. The results of a simulation using the proposed method written in the Prolog programming language are also demonstrated.

AB Bitcoin-otc is a peer to peer, over-the-counter marketplace for trading with bitcoin crypto-currency. To mitigate the risks of the unsupervised exchanges, the establishment of a reliable reputation systems is needed: for this reason, a web of trust is implemented on the website. The availability of all the historic of the users interaction data makes this dataset a unique playground for studying reputation dynamics through others evaluations. We analyze the structure and the dynamics of this web of trust with a multilayer network approach distinguishing the rewarding and the punitive behaviors. We show that the rewarding and the punitive behavior have similar emergent topological properties (apart from the clustering coefficient being higher for the rewarding layer) and that the resultant reputation originates from the complex interaction of the more regular behaviors on the layers. We show which are the behaviors that correlate (i.e. the rewarding activity) or not (i.e. the punitive activity) with reputation. We show that the network activity presents bursty behaviors on both the layers and that the inequality reaches a steady value (higher for the rewarding layer) with the network evolution. Finally, we characterize the reputation trajectories and we identify prototypical behaviors associated to three classes of users: trustworthy, untrusted and controversial.

AB This paper aims at showing a conceptual approach for security and traceability of shared information in the process of transportation of dangerous goods. Concerning the transport of dangerous goods, the process generates particular information, which is necessary to share with the stakeholders involved in this process. This information is considered sensitive, because it may contain the timestamp of movement of goods, information related to the goods, contractual business details, etc., and unauthorized parties should not access them. At any level, the process should remain transparent between stakeholders', with immutable properties on data sharing and the whole process should be auditable. We examine a general procedure for contractual issues for transportation of dangerous goods between stakeholders and its conceptual implementation by blockchain based on smart contracts.

AB Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with successive interference cancellation receiver is considered as one of the most potent multiple access techniques to be adopted in future wireless communication networks. Data security in the NOMA transmission scheme is on much attention drawing issue. Blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer network enables a way of protecting information from unauthorized access, tempering etc. By utilizing encryption techniques of blockchain, a secured data communication scheme using blockchain in NOMA is proposed in this paper. A two-phase encryption technique with key generation using different parameter is proposed. In the first-phase data is encrypted by imposing users' public key and in the second phase, a private key of the base station (BS) is engaged for encryption. Finally, the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing scheme is proven through a comparative study based on the different features.

AB Traceability of ICs is important for verifying provenance. We present a novel IC traceability scheme based on blockchain. A blockchain is an immutable public record that maintains a continuously-growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. In the proposed scheme, 1C ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, we also need to establish correspondence between a record in a public database and the physical device, in an unclonable way. We propose an embedded physically unclonable function (PUF) to establish this correspondence The blockchain ensures the legitimacy of an IC's current owner, while the PUF safeguards against IC counterfeiting and tampering. Our proposed solution combines hardware and software protocols to let supply chain participants authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips during their entire life cycle.

TI Postmoney theory: value function in the domain of postmoney
SO FORESIGHT
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to research the latest quantitative and qualitative transformations of money and its interaction with the market economy and societies in terms of their influence on the inner nature of money and its transformation from a simple tool to an aim per se, i.e. postmoney. Transforming the perception of the intrinsic value and soul of the money into the postmoney, influenced by the rising longevity and wide expectation for the ability to scientifically prolong the human life, will be discussed. This transformation will be confirmed by analysing the results from a national representative sociological survey (panel study with sample size n = 1,000).
   Design/methodology/approach The author uses the following philosophical methodological approaches - comparative-constructive, phenomenological, cognitive and deconstructive analysis.
   Findings The objective and qualitative reasons offered by the postmoney theory (PMT) for the transformation of money into postmoney, are related to the being of temporality, as well as to technologization and the sixth factor of production, scientific exponentiality and mental changes in the human being. A current postmoney survey gives a strong base to believe that the perception of an intrinsic value of postmoney changes the shape of a value function - from logarithmic to linear or even stochastic. This is the reason to believe that increasing of a postmoney quantity will lead to a qualitative transformation and psychological increase of postmoney sensitivity.
   Research limitations/implications The author intends to expand the postmoney survey on the international level so to confirm local findings.
   Practical implications Postmoney survey might be used as a powerful tool in creating and legalizing non-monistic money based on blockchain technologies and philosophical and socio-economic research of the postmoney issue.
   Social implications The future of money is of great importance for the exponentiality of the socio-economic environment and societies. Social impact of the money will be inevitably rising in the domain of postmoney perception.
   Originality/value The author of the current paper coined for the first-time notion of postmoney and now is expanding research developing PMT. As per the best knowledge of the author, shape of the curve of value function was not questioned and believes it might be of help to better understand the money phenomenon.

TI Determining an optimal threshold on the online reserves of a bitcoin
   exchange
SO JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY
AB Online and offline storage of digital currency present conflicting risks for a Bitcoin exchange. While bitcoins stored on online devices are continually vulnerable to malware and other network-based attacks, offline reserves are endangered on access, as transferring bitcoins requires the exposure of otherwise encrypted and secured private keys. In particular, fluctuations in customer demand for deposited bitcoin require exchanges to periodically refill online storage systems with bitcoins held offline. This raises the natural question of what upper limit on online reserves minimizes losses due to theft over time. In this article, we investigate this optimization problem, developing a model that predicts the optimal ceiling on online reserves, given average rates of deposits, withdrawals, and theft. We evaluate our theory with an event-driven simulation of the setup, and find that our equation yields a numerical value for the threshold that differs by less than 2% from experimental results. We conclude by considering open questions regardingmore complex storage architectures.

AB We present a distributed ledger application for the world of citizen philanthropy and social entrepreneurship, with stakeholder incentives designed to increase social good through accountability, transparency, and flexibility. In this system, called Directed Cash, individual donors specify conditions (the "Directed" part) attached to their donation or investment ("Cash"), that are then efficiently paired with interested recipients or aggregators of recipients (charities, social entrepreneurs) using distributed consensus so that the intent and pairing are open while maintaining donor anonymity. Furthermore, Directed Cash flows both ways to promote accountability and transparency: after receipt, a validation flows backwards to return to the donor so that the donor receives a report of how their donation was spent. While some elements of the system borrow from existing cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, we propose alternative incentives for distributed consensus that are better aligned with the application and promote social good through the stakeholders. This paper describes the goals and concepts, and a system design to achieve these goals, a primary feature of which is a simple SQL-like language to enable specifying conditions, pairing, aggregation and publicly-verifiable reporting.

AB A popular technique for tolerating malicious faults in open distributed systems is to establish small groups of participants, each of which has a non-faulty majority. These groups are used as building blocks to design attack-resistant algorithms.
   Despite over a decade of active research, current constructions require group sizes of O(log n), where n is the number of participants in the system. This group size is important since communication and state costs scale polynomially with this parameter. Given the stubbornness of this logarithmic barrier, a natural question is whether better bounds are possible.
   Here, we consider an attacker that controls a constant fraction of the total computational resources in the system. By leveraging proof-of-work (PoW), we demonstrate how to reduce the group size exponentially to O(log log n) while maintaining strong security guarantees. This reduction in group size yields a significant improvement in communication and state costs.

AB There is surge of interest to the blockchain technology not only in the scientific community but in the business community as well. Proof of Work (PoW) and Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) are the two main classes of consensus protocols that are used in the blockchain consensus layer. PoW is highly scalable but very slow with about 7 (transactions/second) performance. BFT based protocols are highly efficient but their scalability are limited to only tens of nodes. One of the main reasons for the BFT limitation is the quadratic O(n(2)) communication complexity of BFT based protocols for n nodes that requires n x n broadcasting. In this paper, we present the Musch protocol which is BFT based and provides communication complexity O(fn + n) for f failures and n nodes, where f < n/3, without compromising the latency. Hence, the performance adjusts to f such that for constant f the communication complexity is linear. Musch achieves this by introducing the notion of exponentially increasing windows of nodes to which complains are reported, instead of broadcasting to all the nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first BFT-based blockchain protocol which efficiently addresses simultaneously the issues of communication complexity and latency under the presence of failures.

AB Fog computing has emerged due to the problem that it becomes difficult to store every data to the cloud system as the number of Internet of Things increases. In this fog computing, a vast amount of data generated from the Internet of Things is transmitted to the cloud system located at a remote place, and is processed by a fog computer such as a sensor or a router located nearby, so that only the necessary data is transmitted to the cloud system. However, the above-mentioned fog computer has some drawbacks like being shut down due to an attack by a malicious user in advance, and a method of processing when a fog computer is down or restored. In this paper we describe a fog computing with blockchain that enables fog computers to share transaction generated by processing transaction information of a device controlled by a blockchain method to a security and device control method of a fog computer utilizing the technology. Furthemore by using security properties of blockchain such as authentication, non-repudiation and data integrity, fog computing using blockchain has advantage of security comparing to previous Cloud and fog computing system using centralized database or P2P networks.

AB The success of almost any business depends on the promotion of digital excellence. Disruptive technologies like Hadoop, IoT, Blockchain or DevOps pose completely new challenges for business development. While there is no doubt about the need for keeping pace with the technical progress it is blurry how much this affects leadership and organizational agility. At least in Germany, many analysts record a gap between the engineering innovativeness and an inadequate digital leadership. It is evident, that digitization leads to new occupational profiles and a specific stress on the organizational fabric. Many companies experiment with start-up culture, entrepreneurial responsibility and more flexible team patterns, but a consistent approach for manager is still missing. In this preliminary discussion we address three dimensions to increase a company's agility in times of digital Darwinism: structural flexibility, software-driven occupational profiles and requirements for leadership.

AB Establishing a root-of-trust is a key early step in establishing trust throughout the lifecycle of a device, notably by attesting the running software. A key technique is to use hardware security in the form of specialised modules or hardware functions such as TPMs. However, even if a device supports such features, other steps exist that can compromise the overall trust model between devices being manufactured until decommissioning. In this paper, we discuss how blockchains, and smart contracts in particular, can be used to harden the overall security management both in the case of existing hardware enhanced security or when only software attestation is possible.

AB Blockchains are secure by design and they have been widely used in digital asses, trade finance, information security and many other fields. However, the current blockchain protocol requires that each full node must contain the complete chain. When the storage capacity of a full node is less than that of the complete chain, this node cannot be a member of blockchain system. With the input data increasing, the number of full nodes in blockchains would decrease. The security of blockchains would significantly reduce. Therefore, we provide the ElasticChain, which can improve storage scalability under the premise of ensuring blockchain data safety. The full nodes in ElasticChain store the part of the complete chain based on the duplicate ratio regulation algorithm. Meanwhile, the node reliability verification method was used for increasing the stability of full nodes and reducing the risk of data imperfect recovering caused by the reduction of duplicate number. The experimental results on real datasets show that ElasticChain has the same stability, fault tolerance and security with the current blockchain system and it improves the storage scalability extremely.

AB We design a protocol based on blockchain, which produces unpredictable, unbiased and publicly verifiable randomness. We use the properties of blockchain to enlarge the scale of participation and output public randomness without trusted third party. And we restructure a timed commitment to make the commitments can be verified, and to ensure that no one can control or bias the value of randomness and it can be verified quickly. Everyone who just need to check the content recorded in blockchain can quickly verify that the randomness produced by our protocol is computationally indistinguishable from uniform distribution and unknown before the end of protocol. And not like the previous works that generate public randomness based on PoW, our protocol does not depend on the cost of mining to guarantee security, so our protocol can generate public randomness based on PoS and other protocols with low consumption.

AB Through the studying of the status quo of medical industry, we find some problems with the sharing of medical data. The medical data in traditional medical institution is stored on severs and its backup database, resulting in lack of communication among medical institutions and ineffective use of medical resources. In order to solve this problem, we propose a medical information sharing model based on blockchain technology. In this model, we build a p2p network to connect different medical institutions and other nodes. Meanwhile, we establish two associated blockchain to store medical data digests and requests. Each node in the p2p network can search the medical information in the distributed medical institutions. In this way, we have integrated medical data between medical institutions and improved the transparency and sharing of medical data. Also, we improve the traditional POW (power of work) algorithm, by using the double-chain structure, we reduce the confirmation time of a block.

AB Traditional centralized PKIs are vulnerable due to the single point of failure. A feasible solution is to build a decentralized PKI without certificate authority (CA). Web of Trust is the first step toward realizing a decentralized PKI, but it still has some limitations such as missing incentive and leaking user's privacy. Blockchain's numerous desirable properties, such as cryptographical security, decentralized nature and unalterable transaction record, make it a suitable tool to implement a decentralized PKI. However, the latest research findings about blockchain-based PKI are still incompatible with the thin-clients which have limited storage ability to download the entire blockchain. To combat that, we firstly present a Privacy-preserving Thin-client Scheme (PTS) utilizing the idea of k-anonymity, which enables thin-clients to run normally as full node users and protect user's privacy simultaneously. After that, in order to reduce cost, we further propose an Efficient Privacy-preserving Thin-client Scheme (EPTS) employing the method of PIR (private information retrieval). Then security analysis and functional comparison are performed to demonstrate the high security and comprehensive functionality of EPTS compared with existing schemes. Finally, extensive experiments are undertaken to confirm that EPTS can reduce computational cost and communication cost impressively.

AB At present, the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly setting off a huge wave of digitalization in traditional industries. In the era of the Internet of Everything, massive data is generated by IoT devices. Recently, Blockchain has attracted more and more attentions in the field of IoT due to its decentralization, traceability, security and so on. Many IoT-oriented data services are built based on distributed ledger technology like blockchains. However, due to the lack of scalability and high transaction costs of the public blockchain, it is hard to directly apply the blockchain technology to IoT scenarios. The recent transaction directed acyclic graph (TDAG) technology, especially Tangle, is suitable for low-latency M2M (Machine to Machine) micropayment transactions in the ever-growing scale of the edge-centric IoT. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate Tangle into IoT blockchains and build a cross-chain interactive decentralized access model in the context of data management. We employ a consortium blockchain as the control station, and Tangle runs as the backbone of all IoT devices. It is equivalent to opening the off-chain channel of the DAG Tangle structure on the consortium blockchain. Transactions in these channels form the sub-Tangle and then merge sub-Tangle into the main Tangle for confirmation through the notary mechanism. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed model and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its performance. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

AB Cryptocurrency exchanges are frequently targeted and compromised by cyber-attacks, which may lead to significant losses for the depositors and closure of the affected exchanges. These risks threaten the viability of the entire public blockchain ecosystem since exchanges serve as major gateways for participation in public blockchain technologies.
   In this paper, we develop an economic model to capture the short-term incentives of cryptocurrency exchanges with respect to making security investments and establishing transaction fees. Using the model, we derive conclusions regarding an exchange's optimal economic decisions, and illustrate key features of these conclusions using graphs based on real-world data. Our security investment model exhibits horizontal scaling properties with respect to reducing exposure to losses, and may be of special interest to exchanges operating in markets with high price volatility.

AB Bitcoin has created a new exchange paradigm within which financial transactions can be trusted without an intermediary. This premise of a free decentralized transactional network however requires, in its current implementation, unrestricted access to the ledger for peer-based transaction verification. A number of studies have shown that, in this pseudonymous context, identities can be leaked based on transaction features or off-network information. In this work, we analyze the information revealed by the pattern of transactions in the neighborhood of a given entity transaction. By definition, these features which pertain to an extended network are not directly controllable by the entity, but might enable leakage of information about transacting entities. We define a number of new features relevant to entity characterization on the Bitcoin Blockchain and study their efficacy in practice. We show that even a weak attacker with shallow data mining knowledge is able to leverage these features to characterize the entity properties.

AB The increasing number of cryptocurrencies, as well as the rising number of actors within each single cryptocurrency, inevitably leads to tensions between the respective communities. As with open source projects, (protocol) forks are often the result of broad disagreement. Usually, after a permanent fork both communities "mine" their own business and the conflict is resolved. But what if this is not the case? In this paper, we outline the possibility of malicious forking and consensus techniques that aim at destroying the other branch of a protocol fork. Thereby, we illustrate how merged mining can be used as an attack method against a permissionless PoW cryptocurrency, which itself involuntarily serves as the parent chain for an attacking merge mined branch of a hard fork.

AB IoT utilization in daily lives is very potential and can be applied in various fields, unfortunately the implementation in the social field still lacking. The large number of orphanages in Indonesia caused information distribution not easily available, however donors find it difficult to get the right information about food reserves, especially rice stock in orphanages. This paper proposes an IoT-based system where rice stocks in orphanages can be detected by Raspberry pi which is connected to sensors, data information from raspberry-pi connected to the network that can be accessed and monitored by mobile applications. This application designed for service providers, donors and rice suppliers. Donors send rice through financial transactions with service providers, and rice suppliers will ship items to the orphanage. Blockchain technology is applied to all parties in order to he transparent and reduce transaction manipulation.

AB Personal data are often collected and processed in a decentralized fashion, within different contexts. For instance, with the emergence of distributed applications, several providers are used to correlate their records, to provide personalized services to their clients. As such, to protect users' privacy, different pseudonyms are generally used for different contexts. These pseudonyms have to be unlinkable to prevent identifying records to be associated to the same user. Although unlinkable, these pseudonyms have to be processed and exchanged according to their owners' consent and in a privacy-preserving fashion. In this paper, we propose BDUA, a new Blockchain-based Data Usage Auditing system, that ensures a controlled yet privacy preserving exchange of distributed data, such that a set of authorized auditing entities are able to conduct an accurate auditing relying on registered blockchains' transactions.

AB Motivated by the recent disruption in shaping industries through blockchain, this paper examines the effect of integrating blockchain and Enterprise Resource Planning systems on the relation among the different parties of the supply chain. For a seamless integration, distributors seek to automate payments with retailers under specific conditions, which can be achieved through smart contracts in a blockchain network. In this paper, we study the utilization of QR codes to handle such cases in the supply chain industry between the distributors and retailers in particular. Then, we analyze the contribution of using blockchain to handle these cases. Furthermore, to emphasize the advantages of blockchain on a supply chain, a prototype is implemented and developed using Hyperledger Composer. This prototype highlights the added value blockchain can have on the relation between the two supply chain parties, while providing additional features to build the needed trust between both parties.<bold> </bold>

TI COMPARISON OF BLOCK EXPECTATION TIME FOR VARIOUS CONSENSUS ALGORITHMS
SO RADIO ELECTRONICS COMPUTER SCIENCE CONTROL
AB Context. We consider security properties of decentralized blockchain-based consensus protocols. The object of research is block confirmation time for users to get assurance that their transaction will not be reverted.
   Objective. The goal of the paper is to analyze double-spend attacks on the different blockchain-based systems and compare resulting probabilities of attacker's success.
   Method. We presented two models for two types of attacks on the Ouroboros protocol (for the general and covert adversaries). The models allow calculating the exact number of slots needed to achieve the required level of security. It was shown that the Ouroboros protocol allows achieving the required security level with significantly shorter confirmation period in comparison with Bitcoin. We estimated minimal number of confirmation blocks and compare estimation time for Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros protocols. As a measure of comparison, we considered transaction confirmation time for which the probability of a double-spend attack is less than 0.1%. We use different standard probability distribution and different properties of Markov chains and Random Walks to get comparison of estimated security properties of Bitcoin blockchain against three different models of Bitcoin double spend attack. The splitting attack based on the model where resources of honest participants are divided to compete different chains is applied to Bitcoin and GHOST consensus protocols. Properties of Markov chains and Random Walks are also applied to obtain security estimations for the Ouroboros protocol.
   Results. We developed methods to get specific numbers for average block confirmation time for Ouroboros protocol. We compared minimal number of confirmation blocks needed to ensure a high security for considered protocols: Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros.
   Conclusions. The obtained results allow determination of security bounds for the Bitcoin, GHOST and Ouroboros consensus protocols. Users of the practically deployed blockchain systems may get specific parameters for a given assurance level.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is inspired by network interconnectedness of humans, objects, and cloud services to facilitate new use cases and new business models across multiple enterprise domains including healthcare. This creates the need for continuous data streaming in IoT architectures which are mainly designed following the broadcast model. As more devices communicate with each other via the Internet, it will be crucial to determine the origins of requests and responses. Being able to store records related to the life cycle of requests and responses in an immutable form will provide documentary evidence that will help to establish transparency and accountability within the IoT. Previous works employed provenance techniques to address this problem but focus on the request perspective. However, little or nothing has been done regarding the response perspective. Consequently, this paper proposes and develops a blockchain-based provenance system to trace bi-directionally the sources of requests and responses in the IoT. This is achieved through the investigation of historical communication records. Several empirical evaluations are conducted in a real-world IoT ecosystem to prove the superiority of the proposed work.

In "cryptoassets" we include all cryptocurrencies and a host of various other digital assets (coins and tokens) for which exchange market data is available. Based on our empirical analysis, we identify the leading factor that appears to strongly contribute into daily cryptoasset returns. Our results suggest that cross-sectional statistical arbitrage trading may be possible for cryptoassets subject to efficient executions and shorting.

AB We describe an agent-based conceptual model of a Blockchain system. Blockchain technology enables distributed, encrypted and secure logging of digital transactions in an add-only ledger record. We model and simulate an expanding Blockchain network, describing the participating agents, the transactions, and the verified add-only public ledger record achieving decentralized consensus. All of the essential details of the functioning of the Blockchain including the behaviors and decisions made by agents deciding to join as well as participate in the market are detailed in the prototype model. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the essential elements and functioning of a Blockchain system, implement a generalized simulation and a measure of Blockchain efficiency from an agent choice and energy cost perspective. Our preliminary results indicate that mining choice (transaction block to verify) coupled with proof of work incentives are critical for energy efficiency.

AB Data manipulation is often named as a serious threat to data integrity. Data can be tampered with, and malicious actors could use this to their advantage. Data users in various application domains want to be ensured that the data they are consuming are accurate and have not been tampered with. To validate the integrity of these data, we describe a blockchain-based hash validation method. The method assumes that the actual data is stored separately from the blockchain, and then allows a data identifier and a hash of these data to be submitted to the blockchain. The actual data can be validated against the hash on the blockchain at any time. Several use cases are described for blockchain-based hash validation, and to validate the method it is implemented inside an application audit trail to validate the audit trail data. This implementation shows that blockchain-based hash validation is able to detect malicious and accidental changes that were made to the data.

There was proven the need to develop the strategy of the university education digital transformation, as well as the formation of new information and communication competencies. According to the authors, the strategy of digital transformation of the university education system has to include the modernization of corporate IT architecture management, which should be implemented as a cloud-based platform. The authors analysed the main possible directions of the educational services transformation and the accompanying business processes. The use of blockchain technology for the educational content management module construction is proposed. The integration of the educational content management modules of different Ukrainian universities should become the basis for creating a global cloud-based platform for higher education.

AB Executing business processes in a decentralized manner can improve inter-organizational efficacy. For example, blockchain-based process execution allows, at least conceptually, for cross-organizational compatibility, data integration, and integrity assurance without the need for a centralized trusted operator. However, most business processes run in agile and rapidly changing business environments. Updating a decentralized process requires continuous and extensive consensus-building efforts. Reflecting all organizations' business requirements is hardly practicable. Hence, in many real-life scenarios, to support cases with initially unforeseen properties, organizations can allow to bypass the decentralized process and fall-back to local variants. Yet, the decision to bypass or update a given process can have significant social implications since it may encourage a social dynamic that encourages collective avoidance of the decentralized process. This paper proposes a multi-agent simulation system to assess the social consequences of approving a bypass under given conditions. The proposed simulation is intended to inform the decision-maker (human or machine) on whether to allow to bypass a process or not. Moreover, we present an architecture for the integration of multi-agent simulation system, local process engine, and decentralized process execution environment, and describe a possible implementation with a particular tool chain.

This paper analyzes the features of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-NG system based on blockchian, proposes an improved method of implementing blockchain systems by replacing the structure of the original chain with the graph data structure. It was named GraphChain. Each block represents a transaction and contains the balance status of the traders. Additionally, as everyone knows all the transactions in Bitcoin system will be baled by only one miner that will result in a lot of wasted effort, so another way to improve resource utilization is to change the original way to compete for miller to election and parallel milting. Researchers simulated blockchain with graph structure and parallel mining through python, and suggested the conceptual new graph model which can improve both capacity and performance.

AB Blockchain technology which is the fundamental system of Bitcoin running on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, has attracted a lot of attention. This enables a practical P2P electronic money system with Byzantine fault tolerance and stability with all participating nodes having the same transaction ledger and using a distributed consensus algorithm called Proof of Work (PoW) that performs calculation work called mining. Many studies have proposed methods of enhancing scalability in terms of transaction processing of blockchain, however few studies have proposed them in term of network load in a P2P network architecture. To solve these problems, we propose a method in which all nodes are separated into mining nodes in a pure P2P network and blockchain data having nodes in a distributed hash table (DHT) network. Kademlia is incorporated as DHT network for processing responsible blocks' data for each node cluster and broadcasting efficiently. The results of a broadcast simulation show that our method improved the redundancy rate and average number of messages in the networks.

AB A ride-hailing service, where passengers choose the origin and destination of their ride, preserves location privacy if the origin and destination of the ride are not revealed to anyone other than the driver. Pseudonymity means that the driver and the passenger use a pseudonym and do not reveal their true identity to each other. The service is trusted if a dishonest passenger cannot use the service without paying, and a driver must provide the service to get paid. In this paper, we introduce cryptotrasnport-a ride-hailing service powered by cryptocurrency and blockchain-and we show that it can preserve privacy, pseudonymity, and trust, simultaneously. Furthermore, by using blockchain technology, cryptotransport matches riders with vehicles in a decentralized fashion, without relying on any company or organization to manage the system.

AB The article presents the architecture of communication protocol for modern industrial processes and business based on cyber-physical systems - Industry 4.0. The main attention is paid to one of the key trends of this concept -to economical autonomous agents i. e. to robots or smart things, which are able to make decisions independently about their economic actions. Agents begin to fully participate in business processes, so it is important to automate the processes and ensure formal and secure communication between multiple heterogeneous agents, taking into account the economic component of the industry. The article shows how to organize economic interaction between agents using a peer-to-peer network based on decentralized Blockchain technology and smart contracts. The general concept of protocol work is described and the experience of its implementation on ROS and Ethereum Blockchain is presented in the form of universal software for different agents. As a result, the experience of applying this solution in various projects is described: a business project with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and an educational project of "smart city".

AB Among the now numerous alternative cryptocurrencies derived from Bitcoin, Zcash is often touted as the one with the strongest anonymity guarantees, due to its basis in well-regarded cryptographic research. In this paper, we examine the extent to which anonymity is achieved in the deployed version of Zcash. We investigate all facets of anonymity in Zcash's transactions, ranging from its transparent transactions to the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately. We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage.

AB Bitcoin allows anyone to store small amounts of data on its blockchain as part of a transaction. The data stored become part of the history of Bitcoin's blockchain, which after some time, becomes very tamper resistant, an attribute that many applications find of great use, e.g. document notary systems, asset meta-protocols, etc. However, many use cases require the functionality to revoke (cancel the validity) of the stored data. Previous attempts to handle revocation were not adequate. Since tamper resistance is a default attribute one needs a nonsystemic approach to deal with revocation, which usually implies additional infrastructure to accomplish it. This paper reviews several revocation methodologies together with advantages and disadvantages for each one, as well as proposes a simple and clean solution for revocation without any additional infrastructure or third-party dependencies.

AB Blockchain is the notorious technology behind cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. A large industrial chain ecology is growing around innovations of blockchain. However, given that it is being developed exponentially the challenges businesses are facing finally have a solution - blockchain. Blockchain is undeniably revolutionary in a sense that it brings convenience to customers and companies. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, trustworthiness and collective maintenance, it provides a trustworthy platform in order to achieve a reliable peer-to-peer delivery of value without relying on a single centralized organization. With this in mind, blockchain is foundation businesses need to establish new relationships. The objective of this paper is to explore how blockchain plays a role in different business applications by illustrating what blockchain is as well as exactly how it can be applied to businesses in the current day.

AB In the future, ecosystems for managing travel and all the associated services will be more diverse and innovative. These Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) ecosystems will combine services in an unforeseen way to enable fluent travel experiences. However, to succeed, MaaS ecosystems require integrators and enablers. Blockchains can serve as an technology enabler, but to reach their best potential blockchains need to tackle new business needs. MaaS ecosystems form an excellent arena for this. We present a model of a MaaS ecosystem, enabling easy, quick and trusted transactions taking advantage of artificial intelligence and blockchain-enabled smart contracts. We also present a subset demonstration of this model, TravelToken, which utilizes QR code that stores and uses travel information in smart contract over Ethereum. The benefits are that all travel data can be stored in one ticket, information stays unaltered in blockchain, and value-share as well as compensations in case of delays will be automatic.

AB Recent technological developments have enabled a wide array of new applications in financial markets, e.g. big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, cryptocurrencies, peer-to-peer lending, crowdfunding, and robo-advising, inter alia. While traditionally comprising of computer programs and other technology used to support or enable banking and financial services, the new fintech sector is often seen as enabling transformation of the financial industry. A more moderate and critical view suggests that for the full transformative potential of fintech to be enabled, there is a need for an updated educational curriculum that balances knowledge and understanding of finance and technology. A curriculum that provides a skill portfolio in the two core components and complements them with applied knowledge can support the enabling forces which will render fintech as a true opportunity for the financial service industry and for society as a whole. We attempt a scholarship inquiry into the educational curriculum in finance and technology, aiming to inform this modern educational agenda. We review skills shortages, as identified by firms and experts, and examine the state-of-the art by some of the first educational programs in fintech.

AB This paper proposes a scheme to use blockchain technology for rideshare services. This paper replaces the centralized authority that matches drivers and riders, with block chain and a matching application that uses two types of coins, which encourages the drivers turning into miners. To evaluate the proposed system, this paper applies the proposed blockchain rideshare service to a case study to simulate and find the least matching probability to make drivers benefit from this system. Furthermore, this paper establishes a mathematical model of the stationary distribution of drivers and calculate the stationary profit of each driver in the blockchain rideshare system.

AB In Bitcoin, it is well known that the confirmation of a transaction issued by a user takes a longer time than the mean block-generation time of 10 minutes. In order to understand the stochastic behavior of the transaction-confirmation process, we consider a queueing model with batch service and general input. In our queueing model, we assume that the transaction interarrival times are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and follow a general distribution, and that the transactions waiting in the queue are served in a batch manner. We define the number of transactions in queue just before a transaction arrival as the system state, deriving the steady-state distribution and the mean transaction-confirmation time by matrix analytic method. In numerical examples, we compare analytical results with trace-driven simulation, discussing the applicability of our queueing model to the prediction of the transaction-confirmation time. It is found that exponential-type distributions such as exponential distribution and hyper-exponential one can accurately estimate the mean transaction-confirmation time for the current maximum block-size limit of 1 Mbyte.

AB Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking is a decentralized network topology that enables parties to communicate directly without central servers. The main obstacle preventing the heavy deployment of the P2P topology is the Network Address Translation (NAT) which serves as a solution for the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. Methods proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to solve the NAT traversal issues include Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs (STUN) and Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN). STUN is limited by the type of deployed NAT, and TURN is limited by the peers' discovery mechanism which is application dependent. In this paper we propose a Blockchain-based platform that enables TURN servers to act as relays for Internet of Things (IoT) devices behind NAT. It also provides End-to-End (e2e) security for Constrained and Non-Constrained IoT devices. Results showed that the system has minimal impact on the existing network and can be a potential solution for advancing IoT deployment.

AB Public key distribution and device authentication remain the main security challenges in many systems and applications. Existing solutions are based on Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) backed by Certificate Authorities (CA) to validate the authenticity of the devices. However, distributing and provisioning certificates for each client showed to be impractical especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper we propose a distributed PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) platform based on the Ethereum Blockchain. It contains a decentralized key-store that holds the public keys of all devices, and includes a generic protocol for PSK (Pre-Shared Keys) distribution. PSK keys can then be used by PSK-based security protocols (TLS-PSK, DTLS-PSK, SRTP ...) for securing the communication channel between two devices. This platform includes a client-side module, a public key management module configured on the server, and a smart contract software deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain network. This generic platform can be used by many applications for client and server authentication, data integrity, and secure peer to peer communications. Moreover, this promising system may potentially eliminate the trust requirement imposed by the existing PKI/CAs infrastructure on clients.

SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB Issues of counteracting the legalization of proceeds from crime (money laundering) and the financing of terrorism (CML / FT) are urgent in the context of crime control. The inflow of money from criminal activities has a destructive impact on the state and the society, poses a threat to the economy and the social sphere. This negative process results in the disruption of market economy mechanisms, the criminalization of the production and trade sectors, the emergence of financial imbalances and the increase in the inflation pressure. The problem is urgent for Russia as well, so the development of effective solutions, including legal ones, is one of the priorities for researchers. In the modern context, the digitization of economy creates new opportunities for criminal groups, who use virtual technologies, crypto-currencies and other opportunities of the digital environment to finance terrorism and legalize criminal proceeds. The article presents the results of studying the condition and dynamics of legal regulation in the sphere of CML / FT. They include the qualitative description of the legal basis for CML / FT in Russia, doctrinal conclusions regarding the structure and key features of the Russian model of legal regulation of CML / FT, modern trends and the direction of its future development, predictions regarding the legal basis for CML / FT, setting fundamental and practical goals of the legal doctrine to provide scientific support for CML / FT, as well as legal solutions developed by the author. Besides, the author outlines and supports specific directions of reforming the Russian legislation with the goal of brining it in accord with the challenges of the digitization of economy and the emergence of new types of crime.

AB Enormous research efforts have been investigated in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networking to improve users safety, traffic condition, and provide different reliable services, that are challenging tasks to accomplish in the current Internet model. In-network caching is one of the promising features of Named Data Networking, a new future Internet architecture based on content name instead of the host address. It aims to enhance the network performance, data availability, distribution, and access. The applicability of NDN in VANET introduced several issues, especially in the security and trust relationships. In this paper, we present a reputation-based blockchain mechanism to secure the cache in the vehicular environment and enhance the trust between cache stores and consumer vehicles. The obtained results demonstrate that our scheme outperforms the normal NDN behavior by providing only trust content in the network.

AB In centralized environments, the results of voting events have always been questionable and perceived differently by voters. Most existing E-Voting systems are based on centralized servers where the voters must trust the organizing authority for the integrity of the results. In this paper we propose a novel approach for a decentralized trustless voting platform that relies on Blockchain technology to solve the trust issues. The main features of this system include ensuring data integrity and transparency, and enforcing one vote per mobile phone number for every poll with ensured privacy. To accomplish this, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is used as the Blockchain runtime environment, on which transparent, consistent and deterministic smart contracts will be deployed by organizers for each voting event to run the voting rules. Users are authenticated through their mobile phone numbers without the need of a third party server. Results showed that the system is feasible and may offer a step towards ideal environments for such experience.

AB The celebrated Nakamoto consensus protocol [16] ushered in several new consensus applications including cryptocurrencies. A few recent works [7, 17] have analyzed important properties of blockchains, including most significantly, consistency, which is a guarantee that all honest parties output the same sequence of blocks throughout the execution of the protocol.
   To establish consistency, the prior analysis of Pass, Seeman and Shelat [17] required a careful counting of certain combinatorial events that was difficult to apply to variations of Nakamoto. The work of Garay, Kiayas, and Leonardas [7] provides another method of analyzing the blockchain under the simplifying assumption that the network was synchronous.
   The contribution of this paper is the development of a simple Markov-chain based method for analyzing consistency properties of blockchain protocols. The method includes a formal way of stating strong concentration bounds as well as easy ways to concretely compute the bounds. We use our new method to answer a number of basic questions about consistency of blockchains:
   Our new analysis provides a tighter guarantee on the consistency property of Nakamoto's protocol, including for parameter regimes which [17] could not consider;
   We analyze a family of delaying attacks first presented in [17], and extend them to other protocols;
   We analyze how long a participant should wait before considering a high-value transaction "confirmed";
   We analyze the consistency of CliqueChain, a variation of the Chainweb [14] system;
   We provide the first rigorous consistency analysis of GHOST [20] and also analyze a folklore "balancing"-attack.
   In each case, we use our framework to experimentally analyze the consensus bounds for various network delay parameters and adversarial computing percentages.
   We hope our techniques enable authors of future blockchain proposals to provide a more rigorous analysis of their schemes.

AB The main advantage of Blockchain technology is the immutability of data maintained by decentralized systems. Earlier studies introduce the probability of attackers succeeding in modifying legitimate data in the blocks. We propose "immutability measure", a metric that indicates the degree of difficulty in modifying existing data in Blockchain. We propose different blockchain structures that can be more appropriate for different applications. There are several parameters that determine the difficulty of modifying data in Blockchain. We analyze the impact of each of these parameters on the immutability measure of various blockchain structures. We also study the required computational and electrical power as well as the time for a successful attack in various blockchain structures. We demonstrate that our proposed blockchain structures can exponentially improve the immutability measure with a nominal increase in computing resources.

AB Deep neural network (DNN) applications require heavy computations, so an embedded device with limited hardware such as an IoT device cannot run the apps by itself. One solution is to offload DNN computations from the client device to nearby edge servers [1] to request an execution of the DNN computations with their powerful hardware. However, there are several issues with the solution. One is an availability issue that how we can provide the edge server with some incentives to run the client' apps. The other is a scalability issue that how we can use more servers when there are more DNN requests. Finally, there is an integrity issue that how the client can trust the result coming from anonymous edge servers. We think the blockchain technology can solve these issues to make edge computing more practical. This paper proposes a novel architecture for DNN edge computing based on the blockchain technology. Existing blockchains such as Ethereum do not support execution of a complex program, so we propose a modified blockchain structure and protocol to overcome the limitation.

AB Hospitals provide a considerable amount of questionnaires to patients, and their result data can be one of the significant measures to check a patient's current health. In many cases, however, such data utilization in another kind of healthcare services is unsatisfactory because patients cannot manage the data by themselves. We propose a blockchain-based medical questionnaire management system for data sharing. This system guarantees the integrity of questionnaire result data using characteristics of the blockchain. Furthermore, data in this system can be in interoperable with other systems because it is generated based on the international standard Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources. This paper explores how to use medical questionnaire result data for the lifelong healthcare of patient and better quality of health care services and enhance the security of personal medical records.

AB Bitcoin exchanges rely heavily on traditional intrusion detection system to secure their system. However, this reliance has proven to be high risk, since Bitcoin and other blockchain-based transactions are not easily reversible. Many of the attacks have shown that the traditional intrusion detection system is not enough to safeguard against all possible attacks, and most importantly, in some cases, it takes a long time to assess the damage. In this paper, we first describe three types of intrusion models in Bitcoin exchanges and propose a detection and mitigation system using blockchain analysis for each. The proposed detection and mitigation system exploit the decentralized and public nature of Bitcoin blockchain to complement the existing traditional intrusion detection system as a fail-safe. The proposed method provides real-time intrusion detection capability that the existing work cannot provide. Although the proposed method is specifically for Bitcoin blockchain, similar ideas can be extended to other proof-of-work based blockchain cryptocurrencies.

TI A Novel Bitcoin Mining Scheme Based on the Multi-Leader Multi-Follower
   Stackelberg Game Model
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, it has gained a significant popularity around the world. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system where payment transactions are stored in a data structure named the block-chain. Based on a fully decentralized network, the blockchain is maintained by a community of participants. In Bitcoin system, mining is the fundamental concept. In this paper, we design a new Bitcoin mining scheme based on the multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model. To effectively implement the peer-to-peer relationship of Bitcoin system agents, we assume that mining pool operators are leaders and mining participating users are followers in our Stackelberg game. By using the dynamics of feedback-based repeated process, leaders, and followers can be interacting with one another and make their decisions in a way to reach an efficient system solution. Without the influence of any central authorities and organizations, the proposed method is practically applied to a distributed Bitcoin system. Through system level simulations, we show that our game approach outperforms the existing Bitcoin schemes in providing a better fair-efficient system performance.

In particular, we introduce two mechanisms: one provides privacy and integrity protections on the data being collected by the smart devices, such as medical records or diagnostic data, and the other provides authenticity and integrity of data going into the smart devices, such as software updates. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed mechanisms incur small overhead in terms of storage, communication, and computation, indicating their feasibility to IoT devices with limited storage, computational, and communicational capabilities.

AB Mining congestion is a serious issue in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. It increases the transaction confirmation latency and limits the growth of cryptocurrency. To mitigate the problem, a number of methods have been used in practice and new ideas have been proposed. However, it is not clear whether these schemes can cope with the ever-growing transaction load of cryptocurrencies in the long run. We propose a novel parallel mining method that can adjust the mining capacity based on the transaction load. It does not require an increase in the block size or a reduction of the block confirmation period. In this paper, we describe how and when to divide or merge blockchains, how to solve the imbalanced mining problem, and how to handle the difficulty levels and rewards. We then show the simulation results comparing the performance of Binary blockchain and the traditional blockchain.

AB The financial industry is faced with attractive business opportunities to adopt blockchain. To make such an investment, decision makers need answers to a number of questions including: what existing business problems will be solved, will blockchain solve them, and what long term benefits and new business opportunities blockchain can create. In this paper we analyze security aspects of these questions, focusing on the protection of integrity of data and financial transactions. We start from the analysis of an essential security architecture of financial systems which is based on the perimeter protection and traditional business process safeguards such as maker-checker. Subsequently, we look at the options on how to improve such an architecture to provide protection against malicious internal users and malware implanted inside the system; the vulnerabilities that have been exploited by organized criminal teams of attackers in the attacks seen lately. We show that the improvements based on the preventive safeguards, inherent to blockchain security architecture, provide strong protection against those attacks. Finally, we argue that in comparison with typically used detective measures (e.g. monitoring), security architecture based on the blockchain model provides superior protection against attacks using attack scenarios never seen before.

AB Thanks to the new technologies such as artificial intelligence, natural language processing or blockchain, the sources of international competitiveness shift towards better social and emotional skills of workforce as well as more advanced cognitive capabilities, such as logical reasoning or creativity. Some authors emphasize the role of economic creativity. It has been proved that more economic creativity leads to greater innovation implementation. Therefore we study what factors have influence on creativity and consequently the success of nations in the international competition in the era driven by new forms of automation. We point at the role of culture and we verify the influence of particular national cultural dimensions on creativity using correlation and regression analyses. We found that countries with higher level of Power Distance, Uncertainty Avoidance or Masculinity show lower level of creative outputs. On the contrary, with higher level of both Individualism and Long-term Orientation, the level of creative outputs increases.

AB Validation of Bitcoin transactions rely upon the successful execution of scripts written in a simple and effective, non-Turing-complete by design language, simply called script. This makes the validation of closed scripts, i.e. those associated to actual transactions and bearing full information, straightforward. Here we address the problem of validating open scripts, i.e. we address the validation of redeeming scripts against the whole set of possible inputs, i.e. under which general conditions can Bitcoins be redeemed? Even if likely not one of the most complex languages and demanding verification problems, we advocate the merit of formal verification for the Bitcoin validation framework. We propose a symbolic verification theory for open script, a verifier toolkit, and illustrate examples of use on Bitcoin transactions. Contributions include (1) a formalisation of (a fragment of script) the language; (2) a novel symbolic approach to SCRIPT verification, suitable, e.g. for the verification of newly defined and non-standard payment schemes; and (3) building blocks for a larger verification theory for the developing area of Bitcoin smart contracts. The verification of smart contracts, i.e. agreements built as transaction-based protocols, is currently a problem that is difficult to formalise and computationally demanding.

AB Blockchain became known as the technology underlying the cryptocurrency bitcoin. While here this technology has received quite controversial attention, its proponents expect much more promising applications in other fields. One of these concerns food-chain management, where it is said to have the potential to revolutionise it. This paper looks at this case from an institutional economic perspective. For this, it first clarifies how a straight application of this technology matches basic microeconomic thinking, as restricted to private goods and prices, and thus also the market optimism associated with it. The paper then analyses the role of institutions in the food system as it has so far been organised and how this institutional setting might be changed in order to incorporate this new technology while safeguarding the objective of an overall economic optimum. In order to sketch out some ways in which these conceptual considerations might actually be put to the test, a cursory introduction is given to some options relating to the situation in Romania. Some orientation might thereby be provided for further work.

AB The fourth Industrial Revolution is finding its way into modern manufacturing sites. Assets with a certain degree of implemented communication technology will be enabled to interconnect and cooperate with practically every other entity via the Industrial Internet. An extreme amount of data and information will be exchanged all the time. Machines will be empowered to make crucial decisions autonomously influencing whole production processes. Erroneous, illegitimate or tampered data will lead to incorrect decisions and will be posing a huge threat to future strong cross-linked added value networks. An approach to tackle this issue comes from a technology called distributed ledger technology with its most known variant the "blockchain". Certain properties of blockchain technology are showing promising enhancements for industrial networks primarily in order to guarantee digital trust. In this paper, issues like the ability to scale and the adaption onto the requirements of industrial networks are investigated. It turns out that simulation approaches must be taken into consideration, and a first step for an implementation is presented.

AB Purpose: The aim of this paper is to show the potential use and possibilities of cryptocurrencies for enterprises. This includes the accounting and legal aspects of this new phenomenon. The application will focus on one of the ways to exploit cryptocurrencies, namely CFD contracts.
   Design/methodology/approach: The article describes the capabilities and tools for using cryptocurrency for entrepreners. Selected cryptocurrencies are subjected to statistical analyzes, and so analyze the daily values of the exchange rates from the time of the occurrence of the given cryptochange. Based on the data of selected cryptocurrencies, the possibilities of speculation with cryptocurrency for entrepreneurs are subsequently proposed in the article.
   Findings: Entrepreneurs can also use cryptocurrencies to pay for ordinary businesses in a number of ways without the use of above-standard computing. At the present time, the greater spread of cryptocurrencies payments defends them high volatile and relatively large charges. The cryptocurrencies can be use entrepreneurs for trading.
   Research/practical implications: In the Czech Republic there is a relevant legal regulation that allows transactions to be carried out in cryptocurrencies in accordance with Czech law, using appropriate electronic sales records. The issue contains many other topics for research.
   Originality/value: Cryptocurrencies are considered the biggest innovation in the financial markets over the last 20 years. The use of these entrepreneur's tools has been small for now; however, they may still be a tool to develop enreprenur in the financial markets.

AB Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing--or the insertion of data in the blockchain--is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PM (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as "distributed ledger technology" and "permissioned blockchains." Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PM and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need first to identify pain points in governance, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.

AB Since Bitcoin and Blockchain became popular, various industries have been interested in applying Blockchain technology to their business. Companies have been working on many Proof-of-Concepts to find good use cases. To find use cases quickly in the fast-changing environment around Blockchain, companies repeat short-term Proof-of-Concepts many times. There is some work on evaluation methods for Blockchain-based systems like the evaluation form validating the feasibility of Blockchain-based systems with comprehensive evaluation items and prototypes. However, the previous evaluation methods do not satisfy the tight time constraints of Proof-of-Concepts conducted by companies. It takes a long time to define evaluation indices, implement measurement tools and run a series of tests for all evaluation items. It also takes more time to repeat the evaluation to compare multiple Blockchain-based systems using different Blockchain software products.
   In this paper, we propose a practical screening method for Blockchain-based systems. To reduce time spent on Proof-of-Concepts, the screening phase with a simple check form is introduced before the prototyping phase. Throughout the screening phase, a screening form selects a few Blockchain software products which demonstrate good coverage of requirements for a use case in terms of network topology, settlement finality, governance, privacy/confidentiality and application architecture. After choosing a few promising Blockchain software products, the prototyping phase follows. Prototypes using selected Blockchain software products are evaluated by filling comprehensive evaluation items like the previous methods. The time required for Proof-of-Concepts decreases due to eliminating unpromising Blockchain software products in the screening phase. For the evaluation of the proposed method, we had a case study. The result showed that the estimated workload of a Proof-of-Concept decreased by 59% compared to the previous method.

AB Era of digitalisation introduced new art of fast growing virtual currencies known as cryptocurrencies. To date November 2018, some 2100 cryptocurrencies are listed on renowned portal CoinMarketCap, growing at high pace of 100-200 new increments per month. Many global financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank believe that the invention of Bitcoin and Blockchain has the most disruptive potential since invention of the Internet. But where are other potential areas of cryptos and what are the chances to supplement fiat currencies? This paper synthetises the satus-quo on Bitcoin knowledge while analysing selected monetary aspects such as role and value of money, impact of regulatory constraints, necessity of political sponsorship but also it's volatile market dynamics and speculative nature of investors. In this paper, we present a professional point of view that covers the security and privacy of people and property aspects of Bitcoin.

AB The blockchain is a state of the art technology which is directly associated with the process of mining cryptocurrencies. However, this technology can be practically applied in many areas of the national economy, including oil and gas industry. For example, the blockchain can be useful in solving problems related to the confirming the integrity of primary geological and geophysical data during remote monitoring of the well construction process by excluding the influence of human factor. This technology is referred to as the industrial blockchain and requires consistent encryption and data distribution on storage locations in peer-to-peer network. Any modification of the primary geological and geophysical data in the blockchain system, on any of the computers/equipment in any block, will automatically detected by all participants of the blockchain network. The system of ensuring the integrity and invariability of the received and transmitted data will work as long as at least a single of the network is operated. Hacking such a system is not feasible and cost-effective because the potential attackers have to break through every block, as well as copies of the database on every computer and equipment in the network. This requires a potential attacker to have unique computing resources, which is currently not available. In practice, the reliability of blockchain platforms is confirmed by many years of experience in the bitcoin mining system based on the blockchain principles. The implementation of the blockchain platform in the oil and gas service allowed to ensure and guarantee the reliability of primary geological and geophysical data obtained from wells in real time, to reduce the risks of unauthorized changes. The reliability of the primary data reduces the risks of erroneous management decisions, made by the processing and analysis of these primary well data.

AB In this paper the general aspects of energy consumption and environmental effects of cryptocurrency mining technology are considered. For the data mining equipment, the main technical specifications defining its energy efficiency are analyzed. The aggregation of separate units within data mining pools or installation of respective farms were shown to have the most prominent energy saving effect. Eventually some design and operation issues related to power supply of data mining pools are outlined. The sufficient amount of standards prescribing the power supply design for this new type of energy consumers is still missing. Considering the facility located in Moscow power supply of a data mining pool is studied and respective power quality survey is conducted. Finally, the impact of data mining equipment on the power factor and grid voltage variations is demonstrated.

AB The article describes the advantages provided by the implementation of a directed acyclic graph in the blockchain network. The advantages and known limitations of common blockchain networks are described. It is shown how directed acyclic graph allows increasing the speed of transactions between the network nodes and scaling the channel width due to the formation of parallel chains instead of the single true chain in common blockchain networks. Consequently, it is shown how blockchain network with directed acyclic graph also eliminates the concept of mining, allowing for transactions without the corresponding fees.

AB Smart Grids is an emerging technology promising significant changes in the economy and the social sphere. One among many challenges in their development and distribution is security. Considering recent hackers attacks on energy grids and taking into account the distributed structure of these systems the use of traditional means of computer protection and the search for a crime figure becomes more difficult or impossible. In this article, we introduce some application areas of smart grid forensic science, discuss the opportunities, and outline the open issues in the topic. We summarized challenges for forensic in Smart Grids in connection with a Blockchain and proposed a decentralized transaction platform based on Blockchain tailored to the energy sector with all the latest technology such as advanced metering infrastructure, distributed generation, etc.

AB Residential AC Nano-PV Systems (NPV) are less than 10 kW solar PV systems that can generate, store, control and import or export electrical power from/to the Grid. At the core of these systems are Energy Routers which are hardware/software components that allow control of the system's generators (e.g., solar PV panels), energy storage devices, and loads. In this paper, we review AC NPV design considerations for residential systems, including short-term load prediction for constant power generation, and security issues. Also, we note some of the upcoming technologies of interest in this application such as blockchain.

AB Distributed Infrastructure Initiatives (DIIs) are communities that collaboratively produce and consume infrastructure. To develop a healthy ecosystem, DIIs require an economic model that balances supply and demand, but there is currently a lack of tooling to support implementing these. In this research, we propose an architecture for a platform that enables DIIs to implement such models, focused around a digital currency based on blockchain technology. The currency is issued according to the amount participants contribute to the initiative, which is quantified based on operational metrics gathered from the infrastructure. Furthermore, the platform enables participants to deploy smart contracts which encode self-enforcing agreements about the infrastructure services they exchange. The architecture has been evaluated through a case study at TTN a global distributed crowdsourced Internet of Things initiative. The case study revealed that the architecture is effective for the selected case at TTN. In addition, the results motivate future research lines to support scalability (i.e., to deploy the architecture on a larger scale) and security.

AB This paper describes an algorithm for creating hash function, resistant for quantum computer. The given approach is based on the problem of sob ing a sy stem of polynomial equations in integers, where the number of equations is less than the number of unknown parameters. The developed algorithm is parameterized so the result of the hash function depends on several parameters, therefore, it will take considerably longer to select the solution of the task. The avalanche effect is about 50%, collision is impossible because the task to find a solution of the described system of equations with a degree greater than 3 is algorithmically unsolvable. This hash function was developed for blockchain to ensure its integrity, but it can also be used in any application where a hash function is needed.

AB The article is devoted to the discussion of actual problems of introduction of blockchain technology in banking business, the solution of which determines the prospects of wide commercialization of these innovations. Commercial banks' interest in innovation is determined by the threat of steadily declining business profitability and a new competitive threat to traditional sources of income from new fin-technologies. Despite the active development of crypto-innovations (algorithms, platforms, crypto-currencies), the use of blockchain by banks in the financial sector is still very modest. Like most of the participants in this market, banks only carefully test computer technologies for managing a distributed ledger, and therefore objective barriers hindering progress in this area are of actual interest to specialists and researchers. The application of any innovative technology in the banking business depends on the successful compliance of new opportunities and time-tested requirements of consumers in the financial sector. In particular for the technology of the blockchain, just has not fully resolved key-problems of standardization, boundary identification, security and cyber-security, reliability of execution transaction, scalability of projects, etc. Here considered the main barriers, from the author's viewpoint, of implementation of the blockchain in the banking business, confirmed by the authoritative materials of centers for innovative financial technology.

Results from the mainnet of the Bismuth blockchain demonstrate that the variances in the key variables, difficulty level and blocktime, were more than halved after the tail removal code was enabled. Low variances in difficulty and blocktimes are desirable for timely execution of transactions in the network as well as reduction of unwanted oscillations in the feedback control problem.

AB Although cloud-based malware defense services have made significant contributions to thwarting malware attacks, there have been privacy concern over using these services to analyze suspicious files which may contain user-sensitive data. We develop a new platform called BigBing (a big data approach to binary code genomics) to offer a privacy preserving cloud-based malware classification service. BigBing relies on a community of contributors who would like to share their binary executables, and uses a novel blockchain-based scheme to ensure the privacy of possibly user-sensitive data contained within these files. To scale up malware defense services, BigBing trains user-specific classification models to detect malware attacks seen in their environments. We have implemented a prototype of BigBing, comprised of a big data cluster, a pool of servers for feature extraction, and a frontend gateway that facilitates the interaction between users and the BigBing backend. Using a real-world malware dataset, we evaluate both execution and classification performances of the service offered by BigBing. Our experimental results demonstrate that BigBing offers a useful privacy preserving cloud-based malware classification service to fight against the ever-growing malware attacks.

AB We are living in the era of information technology. Our day to day life is heavily dependent on it and hence it's safe and secure functioning become very crucial and important. Every minute, there are thousands of cyber-attacks taking place around the world. Attackers are continuously evolving sophisticated and stealthy techniques to target the victim. They takes all the precautionary measures to remove attack traces such as system logs and related information on the victim systems so that they cannot be traced back. Attackers intentionally spread their activities over longer period of time to evade detection. To understand and identify such complex attack, it is required to maintain a secure log records over extended time period. However, preserving the log records for longer time is challenging issue. The system should also ensure the integrity of log files and logging process. In order to overcome these issues, in this paper we are proposing a secure log storage using Blockchain on Cloud platform. Blockchain technology will help to create tamper-proof audit logs. It provides proof of log manipulation and non-repudiation. Cloud platform makes the overall system scalable and support for deep analysis.

AB Many civil engineering malpractices can be avoided if there are timely, transparent, and unalterable records of these activities. This paper describes an approach to achieve this purpose with blockchain technology. A novel blockchain system designed to avoid high volatility in token price and encourage public participation in maintaining the ledger is introduced. Civil engineering and construction are the first testing fields for the system. It is anticipated that the system, after successfully implemented, can extend its scope to other areas as well.

AB IoT networks are designed to connect as many devices as possible. Since any device can be connected to an IoT network, it faces an authentication issue, which may be exploited by attackers to break into the IoT network. A solution discussed in this paper is to make use of blockchain technology to authenticate IoT devices before it joins an IoT network. Based on the characteristics of blockchain, it can be used to create the digital identification of IoT devices and authenticate them. Authenticated Devices Configuration Protocol (ADCP) is proposed to achieve this authentication process. All results of the solution have been demonstrated by a fully working implementation, and do not solely rely on theoretical considerations or simulations.

TI REA(2): A unified formalisation of the Resource-Event-Agent ontology
SO APPLIED ONTOLOGY
AB Through a proof of concept in SWI-Prolog, this paper demonstrates a business transaction model by which the trading partners can derive their own, personal perspective from shared data. The demonstration is an innovative formalisation of the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology as it allows for switching viewpoints in real-time between one trading-partner's perspective and that of a trading-partner with an opposing view (i.e., customer or supplier), or a trading-partner independent perspective (e.g. trusted third-party). The business transaction model is achieved by uniting REA with the Open-EDI Business Transaction Ontology (OeBTO). The resulting unified formalisation of the REA ontology (REA(2)) also highlights implications for the future development of a) enterprise information systems (EIS) in the cloud, b) social-media-based EIS, c) blockchain EIS, and d) EIS interoperability across business paradigms. The EIS interoperability such as between traditional EIS (which typically uses a trading-partner perspective), and EIS for the collaborative economy (which typically uses a trading-partner independent perspective) is particularly highlighted as it becomes much more transparent than previously.

AB The potential of WSN related to the IoT concept is immense. According to a Cisco study the IoT will merge with other engineering areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), fog computing and blockchain technologies, creating new business opportunities. Two main directions for solving the main issues of M2M communications can be distinguished: the use of frequency band division ultra-narrow band (UNB) communications and the use of a spread spectrum technique. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the LoRaWAN communication protocol. At the same time, the main features and mechanisms of communication are presented in detail by highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the communication mechanism. From the obtained test results, we can conclude that high-density wireless sensor networks can be implemented using LoRa communication. The stars-of-stars network topology is scalable and offers the possibility to integrate a large number of nodes.

AB The transformation of a traditional city into a Smart City is not a simple task and requires necessarily start from a correct management of energy, which leads to energy efficiency through the sustainable behavior of prosumers. In fact, thanks to new technologies such as IOT and smart appliances, it is possible to induce in the consumer a new type of behavior, not only in energy consumption, but also in the exchange and sale of energy, assuming a fundamental role in Smart Grids Prosumer Side Management appears as a way to manage micro smart grids in a much more complex, volatile and real-time energy market, control and management that are entrusted to Smart Agents and Blockchain to obtain a new model of management of the organs safely and reliably. This paper gives a micromesh model that includes within it a smart home, RES, Electric Vehicle, a control algorithm that leads to the management of the Virtual Power Plant in an adaptive and intelligent way and through the RESCoin (virtual currency linked to RES), so that prosumer facilitated by the process of exchange of energy and money can become the driving of energy transformation in future Smart Cities.

TI Bitcoin in the Brazilian Financial System
SO REVISTA TECNOLOGIA E SOCIEDADE
AB This article elucidates the legal and regulatory aspects of bitcoin, with the aim of reducing the legal uncertainty in the operations carried out with the cryptocurrency. This qualitative descriptive research with deductive method investigates, through the study of legislation and relevant doctrines, which regulatory bodies of the Brazilian Financial System (SFN) the operations with BTC should be submitted to. To do so, the functionalities, potentialities and limitations of the blockchain, technology underlying the cryptocurrency, are introduced. Afterwards, relevant aspects of the National Financial System are highlighted. Next, the article seeks the most appropriate legal conceptual classification for Bitcoin. Once those steps are completed, the paper suggests that because of the legal nature of bitcoin as an intangible good, in the current legal apparatus, there are no regulatory forecasts on the BTC, which is why, now, operations with the virtual currency are not subject to any body of the SEN.

AB Blockchain technology on the platform business becomes a new paradigm which gets security, irreversibility, and trustfulness closer to both of clients and service providers (SPs) for providing a better quality of service. To provide an economic analysis of such blockchain-based platform business, a game theoretic approach is used to model a competitive market against the incumbent platform operated by a centralizer as a trusted third party. In this market, the platforms behave as a mediator to deliver the services provided by SPs to clients. The crucial factors for the success of blockchain-based platform business are (i) how SPs' participation is reflected on its quality of service (QoS) and (ii) how to incentivize SPs to contribute their resources such as computing/storage infrastructure. In our game formulation, a non-cooperative two-stage dynamic game is used, where the first stage models how to incentivize SPs in a blockchain-based platform and the second stage models the competition between platforms to attract clients. As a result, we provide an equilibrium analysis, which gives a useful insight into how much the service quality of blockchain-based platform affects the competition between platforms and the equilibrium incentive strategy for SPs. Moreover, our numerical analysis shows that the equilibrium incentive increases with proportional to the QoS of a blockchain-based platform whereas the incentive becomes negative if it provides a non-increasing QoS with the number of participated SPs.

AB This paper presents a new approach for avoiding double-spending attacks via the concept of recipient-oriented concepts in private blockchain networks. Together with the concepts of stealth address and masternode at recipient sides, transactional privacy is assured and transaction recipients become active which receive transaction propagation unilaterally. Based on this approach, it can be shown that recipient-oriented method is suggested for preventing the double-spending attacks in this paper. In addition, the proposed method is possible to prevent double spending attacks using the verification time of the recipient and blocking time of the transaction.

AB Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new generation of Web application designed to provide native app-like browsing experiences even when a browser is offline. PWAs make full use of new HTML5 features which include push notification, cache, and service worker to provide short-latency and rich Web browsing experiences.
   We conduct the first systematic study of the security and privacy aspects unique to PWAs. We identify security flaws in main browsers as well as design flaws in popular third-party push services, that exacerbate the phishing risk. We introduce a new side-channel attack that infers the victim's history of visited PWAs. The proposed attack exploits the offline browsing feature of PWAs using a cache. We demonstrate a cryptocurrency mining attack which abuses service workers. Defenses and recommendations to mitigate the identified security and privacy risks are suggested with in-depth understanding.

In our application the duties of the Product Owner for certifying the correctness of the outcomes are delegated to one or more Smart Contracts deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain and written in Solidity. An agreement with the Customer can also allow the Smart Contracts to automatically enable payments, to introduce penalties or grants on the basis of the outcome. Product Owner duties and work can thus be relieved allowing to allocate resources on more profitable and productive tasks. Other possibilities are examined as well.

AB Emerging blockchain systems have been widely adopted in sharing economy, such as e-commerce, to allow mutually distrustful parties to transact fairly without trusted parties. Most blockchain systems, however, lack transactional privacy protection. All transactions, including trading relationship between pseudonyms and content transacted, are exposed on the blockchain. Although many existing privacy protection methods on the blockchain have been proposed, it is difficult to find a trade-off between keeping speed and protecting privacy of transactions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel privacy-preserving method RZKPB that does not store financial transactions in clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. Meanwhile, these transactions are as proofs to solve disputes between trading partners. RZKPB ensures fairness and privacy of transactions between participants without adding a new trusted party and breaking the verifying protocol on the blockchain. We take the e-commerce as an example in sharing economy to introduce RZKPB in our paper. Our experimental results show that compared with existing privacy-preserving methods based on the blockchain, RZKPB is more efficient under different settings.

AB Blockchain is a distributed system with efficient transaction recording and has been widely adopted in sharing economy. Although many existing privacy-preserving methods on the blockchain have been proposed, finding a trade-off between keeping speed and preserving privacy of transactions remain challenging. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Fast and Privacy-preserving method based on the Permissioned Blockchain (FPPB) for fair transactions in sharing economy. Without breaking the verifying protocol and bringing additional off-blockchain interactive communication, FPPB protects the privacy and fairness of transactions. Additionally, experiments are implemented in EthereumJ (a Java implementation of the Ethereum protocol) to measure the performance of FPPB. Compared with normal transactions without cryptographic primitives, FPPB only slows down transactions slightly.

AB Timed transaction execution is critical for various decentralized privacy-preserving applications powered by blockchain-based smart contract platforms. Such privacy-preserving smart contract applications need to be able to securely maintain users' sensitive inputs off the blockchain until a prescribed execution time and then automatically make the inputs available to enable on-chain execution of the target function at the execution time, even if the user goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust. This paper presents a new decentralized privacy-preserving transaction scheduling approach that allows users of Ethereum-based decentralized applications to schedule transactions without revealing sensitive inputs before an execution time window selected by the users. The proposed approach involves no centralized party and allows users to go offline at their discretion after scheduling a transaction. The sensitive inputs are privately maintained by a set of trustees randomly selected from the network enabling the inputs to be revealed only at the execution time. The proposed protocol employs secret key sharing and layered encryption techniques and economic deterrence models to securely protect the sensitive information against possible attacks including some trustees destroying the sensitive information or secretly releasing the sensitive information prior to the execution time. We demonstrate the attack-resilience of the proposed approach through rigorous analysis. Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrates that the proposed approach is effective and has a low gas cost and time overhead associated with it.

AB In the age of Big Data, releasing protected sensitive data at a future point in time is critical for various applications. Such self-emerging data release requires the data to be protected until a prescribed data release time and be automatically released to the recipient at the release time, even if the data sender goes offline. While straight-forward centralized approaches provide a basic solution to the problem, unfortunately they are limited to a single point of trust and involve a single point of control. This paper presents decentralized techniques for supporting self-emerging data using smart contracts in Ethereum blockchain networks. We design a credible and enforceable smart contract for supporting self-emerging data release. The smart contract employs a set of Ethereum peers to jointly follow the proposed timed-release service protocol allowing the participating peers to earn the remuneration paid by the service users. We model the problem as an extensive-form game with imperfect information to protect against possible adversarial attacks including some peers destroying the private data (drop attack) or secretly releasing the private data before the release time (release-ahead attack). We demonstrate the efficacy and attack-resilience of the proposed techniques through rigorous analysis and experimental evaluation. Our implementation and experimental evaluation on the Ethereum official test network demonstrate the low monetary cost and the low time overhead associated with the proposed approach and validate its guaranteed security properties.

AB Cloud storage is one of the most important service of cloud computing. Since cloud service providers can not be completely trusted, traditional auditing methods can't guarantee the security of data sources. This paper proposes a security framework for cloud data audit using blockchain technology. User's operational information on the file is formed to a block after validated by all checked nodes in the blockchain network, and then to be put into the blockchain. Any modification or fake to the operational information can be inspected through the chain structure of block, thus ensuring the security of auditing data source. We construct a prototype in an Ethereum-based blockchain using Aliyun as data storage service, then test the time overhead of uploading file, broadcasting operation information and packing information into block chain. The results show that the time for packaging block remains unchanged from an overall viewpoint, and as the file size increasing, packaging block occupies less percentage in the entire process of file uploading or downloading.

AB The existing identity authentication of IoT devices mostly depends on an intermediary institution, i.e., a CA server, which suffers from the single-point-failure attack. Even worse, the critical data of authenticated devices can be tampered by inner attacks without being identified. To address these issues, we utilize blockchain technology, which serves as a secure tamper-proof distributed ledger to IoT devices. In the proposed method, we assign a unique ID for each individual device and record them into the blockchain, so that they can authenticate each other without a central authority. We also design a data protection mechanism by hashing significant data (i.e. firmware) into the blockchain where any state changes of the data can be detected immediately. Finally, we implement a prototype based on an open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric to verify the proposed system.

AB In this study we proposed a Blockchain-based distributed power generation trading system and its trading mechanism. By utilizing the linear supply bidding we prove that a market under assumption has a competitive equilibrium where each generator within the microgrid maximizes its profit, each load's demand is fulfilled and the welfare of whole microgrid has been maximized. Additionally we introduced a distributed supply bidding algorithm to solve the global welfare optimization. Last but not least, we designed a trading system architecture where each market participant is abstracted as a virtual agent and continuously interacting with each other by exchanging information through a smart power contract. Combining with our distributed algorithm, the microgrid market can reach its competitive equilibrium gradually. A numerical study is conducted on a simplified microgrid to demonstrate the effectiveness of our study.

AB Focusing on the overlapping areas of the logistics industry with a large number of mature blockchain applications and the public welfare industry that requires high transparency and credibility, this paper designs and implements an innovative philanthropy logistics platform based on blockchain technology through the Ethereum platform. Our platform makes use of the open, transparent, and irrevocable features of the blockchain, combined with a unique Responsibility Relay System and Evaluation and Reporting Mechanism, and can achieve the consistency of the data on the chain with real-world status, as well as the authenticity and transparency of philanthropy logistics data. This paper also establishes a model for evaluating philanthropy material donations for social welfare based on the classic network maximum flow algorithm. After four months of empirical analysis, we have concluded that the blockchain platform can greatly increase the user's trust in the project, enhance the system's cleanliness coefficient and increase the quality of philanthropically raised materials, thereby improving the public welfare of charitable donations. The paper draws the conclusion that this blockchain platform is a technical solution for maximizing social welfare.

AB With a market cap of about 1.5 billion US dollar, Monero is one of the most popular crypto-currencies at present. Much of its growing popularity can be attributed to its unique privacy feature. Observing that no formal security analysis is presented, we initiate a formal study on Monero's core protocol. In this study, we revisit the design rationale of an important component of Monero, namely, range proof. Our analysis shows that the range proof may not be a proof-of-knowledge even if the underlying building block, ring signature, is secure. Specifically, we show that if a certain secure ring signature scheme is used, it is impossible to construct a witness extractor unless the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem is equivalent to the Discrete Logarithm problem. This shows that the design rationale is to possibly flawed. Then, we present a new range proof protocol that enjoys a few advantages. Firstly, it is a zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge protocol. Secondly, it is compatible with the Monero's wallet and algebraic structure and thus does not require extensive modification in the codebase. Finally, the efficiency is comparable to Monero's version which does not admit a formal security proof.

AB To support authors' benefits, reduce brokerage, identify accidence-raised liabilities, and make fair reviews to inspire quality writings, an author-centered media blockchain ecosystem is proposed and its principles, technical design and implementation issues are discussed in this article. The media ecosystem is operated autonomously on a smart contract-based consortium blockchain, with which three public facilities are provided for the participants, i.e., a composing service for authors, a media service for publishers, and an evaluation service for third-party creditworthiness providers. The media ecosystem repositions the authors' and the publishers' role involved in the publishing process, in which the authors' writings would neither be submitted to, nor evaluated by the media. The authors hold their writings and have the right to release them through the ecosystem. The writings are evaluated by a third-party creditworthiness provider and their information on composing, updating, reading, circulating and comments are traced and won't be interfered.

AB Data explosion has raised a scalability challenge to cloud storage management, while spinning disk capacity growth rates will continue to slow down. Major data holders such as cloud storage providers with a heavy reliance on disk as a storage medium will need to orchestrate multiple kinds of storage to better manage their relentless data growth.
   In this paper, we first explore the scenario that multiple clouds are driven by interests to make the storage resources efficiently allocated without requiring a trusted third party, and then propose a novel model, called CloudShare, to enable multi-clouds to carry out a transparent encrypted data deduplication among cross-users via blockchain. Our scheme significantly reduces the storage costs of each cloud, and saves the upload bandwidth of users, while ensuring data confidentiality and consistency. We demonstrate via simulations on a realistic datasets that CloudShare achieves both the effectiveness and the efficiency.

AB Banks play an important role in the financial market, and their profit mainly comes from loan service. Traditional risk management approaches, as the key part in the loan services, still have several issues including low data credibility, unreliable checking and alert delay. We propose a novel dynamic credit risk management system which leverages edge-based blockchain technology to improve the performance and provide a fair loan environment. Besides, we discuss the potential challenges that the system may face, such as data standards, security on edge and scalability.

AB Innovations such as the Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and data analytics have already dramatically altered the customer experience in many, if not all, industries. Blockchain, as another emerging technology, is expected to be the next generation infrastructure to established trusted multi-party collaborations. In this paper, we investigated the convergence of aforementioned technologies, by presenting a prototype of fine-grained transportation insurance. Insurance premium were assessed based on vehicle's usage and driver's behavior, which were deduced from streaming IoT data collected from mobile sensors. This incentive mechanism promotes fairness among drivers and encourages safer driving style. The prototype takes advantage of both private blockchain (e.g., high transaction rate in Hyperledger) and public blockchain (e.g., inbuilt cryptocurrency). Besides system architecture and implementation details, preliminary performance evaluations are presented and discussed.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency for managing and transferring money in a distributed manner. The Bitcoin network creates a complex system of economic incentives that governs its inner working, impacting the network's security guarantees and its evolution. Recent development of Bitcoin as a speculative asset and the herein skyrocketing Bitcoin price greatly incentivize participation in the network. We posit that the expansion in Bitcoin miner population and speculative transactions may not be socially desirable. The increased competition in Bitcoin mining not only exacerbates energy consumption and environmental cost, but also makes the risky mining business much riskier. In addition to the risk of unstable reward flows, the fluctuation in Bitcoin price makes the profitability of mining more uncertain. This research studies an alternative socially optimal model for the Bitcoin market (and other cryptocurrencies in general). Through equilibrium analysis, we emphasize the need to limit speculation in Bitcoin transactions, improve efficiency, diversify currency portfolio, and minimize negative externalities of the Bitcoin mining business.

AB Cryptocurrency is a rapid developing financial technology innovation which has attracted a large number of people around the world. The high-speed evolution, radical price fluctuations of cryptocurrency, and the inconsistent attitudes of monetary authorities in different countries have triggered panic and chain reactions towards the application and adoption of cryptocurrency and have caused public security related events. So far, a lot of researches and analyses have focused on just one or only a few number of cryptocurrencies, a comprehensive analysis of the whole cryptocurrency market and its systemic risk is still lacking. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics and systemic risk of the cryptocurrency market based on the public available price history. We first validated that the correlation matrix and asset tree are good tools to analyze the risk and stability of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, consistent with public perception, our quantitative analysis reveals that the cryptocurrency market is relatively fragile and unstable. Our work is the first to investigate the systemic risk of the whole cryptocurrency market and may shed some light on cryptocurrency related investment decision, regulation, and legislation.

AB Blockchain networks have been claimed to have the potential of fundamentally changing the way humans perform economic transactions with each other. In such networks, trust-enabling agents and activities, that were traditionally arranged in a centralized fashion, are replaced by a network of nodes which collectively yet independently witness and establish the non-repudiability of transactions. Most often, a proof-of-work (PoW) requirement ensures that participants invest resources for joining the network, incentivizing conformance to the network rules, while making it highly infeasible for malicious agents to construct an alternative version of the transaction history. While research on security and efficiency aspects of blockchain networks is already being conducted, there is still work to be done to understand how different external and internal conditions guarantee or threaten their sustainability, i.e., their continuous operation. Focusing on public PoW-based blockchain platforms, in this paper we sketch an abstract model that is aimed at supporting comprehension and qualitative reasoning about the factors that affect sustainability of a blockchain network.

AB The number of deployed Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been increasing rapidly, and security has become significantly important in IoT environments. However, security issues remain challenging due to constraints of IoT devices. One critical security issue is that attacks tamper the firmware of IoT devices. Once the firmware is tampered, it is difficult to notice and recover the tampered firmware. For the integrity of firmware, this paper proposes a new blockchain-based firmware verification system, called ChainVeri. We overcome vulnerabilities of previous studies such as fudging firmware verification. Furthermore, unlike previous studies that presented only the concepts and ideas, we implement ChainVeri from scratch and carry out performance evaluation on storage consumption and CPU cycles to run ChainVeri on IoT device. Our results show that only 1.2MB of storage is used to verify 2,845 devices. Also, 1,692 CPU cycles are to generate a palette in ChainVeri.

AB An online community based on blockchain is proposed for software developers to share, assess, and learn codes and other codes or software related knowledge. It involves three modules or roles, namely: developer (or coder, or more generally, knowledge contributor), code (or knowledge contribution), and jury (or assessor, who is usually a developer with advanced skills), in addition to the blockchain based database. Each full node of the blockchain hosts a copy of all activities of developers in such community, including uploading contributions, assessing others' contributions, and conducting transactions. Smart contracts are applicable to automate transactions after code assessment or other related activities. The system aims to assess and improve the value of codes accurately, stimulate the creativity of the developers, and improve software development efficiency, so as to establish a virtuous cycle of a software development community.

AB ECDSA is a standardized signing algorithm that is widely used in TLS, code signing, cryptocurrency and more. Due to its importance, the problem of securely computing ECDSA in a distributed manner (known as threshold signing) has received considerable interest. However, despite this interest, there is still no full threshold solution for more than 2 parties (meaning that any t-out-of-n parties can sign, security is preserved for any t - 1 or fewer corrupted parties, and t <= n can be any value thus supporting an honest minority) that has practical key distribution. This is due to the fact that all previous solutions for this utilize Paillier homomorphic encryption, and efficient distributed Paillier key generation for more than two parties is not known.
   In this paper, we present the first truly practical full threshold ECDSA signing protocol that has both fast signing and fast key distribution. This solves a years-old open problem, and opens the door to practical uses of threshold ECDSA signing that are in demand today. One of these applications is the construction of secure cryptocurrency wallets (where key shares are spread over multiple devices and so are hard to steal) and cryptocurrency custody solutions (where large sums of invested cryptocurrency are strongly protected by splitting the key between a bank/financial institution, the customer who owns the currency, and possibly a third-party trustee, in multiple shares at each). There is growing practical interest in such solutions, but prior to our work these could not be deployed today due to the need for distributed key generation.

AB As an important part of the smart grid, the Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) can provide various auxiliary services for the power grid and promote the use of renewable resources. However, there are various kinds of attacks in the V2G network. Based on consortium blockchain, this paper proposes a cross-domain authentication scheme for the security threat in the V2G network. This paper designs the trust model and the system architecture, and describes the scheme in detail. The signature and authentication of the scheme adopt the SM9 identity-based cryptographic algorithm. This scheme utilizes the fact that block chain technology is not easy to tamper with. It uses a hash algorithm to verify the certificate, reducing the number of public key algorithm signatures and verifications, making the solution efficient and scalable. The introduction of block chain technology provides new ideas and methods for solving the security problems in the Smart Grid.

AB Electronic medical record (EMR) is a crucial form of healthcare data, currently drawing a lot of attention. Sharing health data is considered to be a critical approach to improve the quality of healthcare service and reduce medical costs. However, EMRs are fragmented across decentralized hospitals, which hinders data sharing and puts patients' privacy at risks. To address these issues, we propose a blockchain based privacypreserving data sharing for EMRs, called BPDS. In BPDS, the original EMRs are stored securely in the cloud and the indexes are reserved in a tamper-proof consortium blockchain. By this means, the risk of the medical data leakage could be greatly reduced, and at the same time, the indexes in blockchain ensure that the EMRs can not be modified arbitrarily. Secure data sharing can be accomplished automatically according to the predefined access permissions of patients through the smart contracts of blockchain. Besides, the joint-design of the CPABE-based access control mechanism and the content extraction signature scheme provides strong privacy preservation in data sharing. Security analysis shows that BPDS is a secure and effective way to realize data sharing for EMRs.

AB With the construction and implementation of the government information resources sharing mechanism, the protection of citizens' privacy has become a vital issue for government departments and the public. This paper discusses the risk of citizens' privacy disclosure related to data sharing among government departments, and analyzes the current major privacy protection models for data sharing. Aiming at the issues of low efficiency and low reliability in existing e-government applications, a statistical data sharing framework among governmental departments based on local differential privacy and blockchain is established, and its applicability and advantages are illustrated through example analysis. The characteristics of the private blockchain enhance the security, credibility and responsiveness of information sharing between departments. Local differential privacy provides better usability and security for sharing statistics. It not only keeps statistics available, but also protects the privacy of citizens.

AB Video transcoding has been widely applied in video streaming industry to convert videos into multiple formats for heterogeneous users. To provide fast and reliable transcoding services, some emerging platforms are leveraging blockchain and smart contract technology to build decentralized transcoding hubs with flexible monetization mechanisms, where any users can rent their idle computing resources to become transcoders in order to receive reward. On these blockchain-enabled platforms, transcoder selection together with resource allocation is a crucial but challenging issue, which should maximize the transcoding revenue to motivate the transcoder candidates as well as handling the dynamic quality of service (QoS) requirements and candidates' characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based transcoder selection framework for blockchain-enabled video streaming. Specifically, we propose an evaluation mechanism to facilitate transcoder selection, and design the transcoder selection and resource allocation scheme using the DRL approach. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

AB At present, the spot exchange will encounter two major problems in the commodity transaction. One is the risk of the transaction. The second is the transaction controllability problem. The problem of transaction accuracy is mainly manifested in the complex links. The information transparency is not high. The stakeholders are relatively independent, thus exacerbating the risk of the transaction. Spot trading market is very large, there are many difficulties in the process of market transactions, and the controllability is not high, which brings security risks to the healthy development of spot trading market. Therefore, in this paper, the block chain technology distributed book functions were combined to improve the rapid interaction of information. Market bi-directional transactions were increased, the authenticity and reliability of the transaction was guaranteed, and the risk of the transaction was reduced. In addition, the decentralization function of block chain technology was exploited, and the ability of market regulators to supervise the market order was improved. The healthy development of spot trading was guaranteed.

Finally, the case explains the application of the value system that can be used in conjunction with the alliance chain, the private chain, the public chain, and the process of enterprise value assessment. The automatic decision value system model can help optimize the enterprise value chain and assess the true value of the enterprise from four aspects: integration, optimization, control, and value-added satisfaction.

AB Information asymmetry and false information are disturbing and have been damaging investors' interests in investment management. The current studies usually only aim to evaluate the value of enterprises to reduce the degree of information falsehood, but they can't solve the problem from the origin. In this paper, we use the blockchain technologies to restructure the enterprise value system to lower the impacts of these problems, including improving value chain of enterprises with smart-contracts, defining token as an incentive method and using token to evaluate the value of enterprises. Then implementing the new value system into the internet industry to accomplish industrialization. We find that the novel value system not only saves the costs Of time and wages, but also ensures the authenticity and reliability of enterprises data.

AB Centered on the value of listed banks in investment management, this article proposes an automatic pattern recognition value system based on blockchain. It will be of great value for investors to reasonably estimate the stock value of listed banks. In this way, the investors will make a better investment decision, which will realize the rational allocation of social resources. The new value system includes three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; (c) assessment of value. In the framework, we encapsulate the valuable business processes of listed banks through smart contracts. The cryptographic algorithms and token mechanism ensure the normal operation of the transaction. We record the value of listed banks by distributed ledger technology. Consensus mechanism verifies the validity of records. Meanwhile, the token mechanism completes the value transfer and acts as an incentive measure for network node accounting. Finally, we evaluate the value of listed banks from integration, optimization, control, and value-added satisfaction services. Therefore, the new value system can correctly guide investors in making a rational investment, which will increase investment returns and ultimately realize the rational allocation of social resources.

Fully text-based tutorials are often difficult to follow. General picture of Blockchain operations gets lost in lengthy textual descriptions. With the Java application introduced in this paper, users can experiment with key Blockchain concepts through a graphical user interface. They can generate keys, hashes, transactions, blocks and wallets. They can see the low level details of a blockchain such as encryption keys and hashes. They can see how mining works and how blocks are added to a blockchain. Parameters of a blockchain can also be varied in order to observe their impact on performance or even to make a blockchain invalid. The Java application is intended to be used in classroom environment by instructors when they teach introductory Blockchain courses.

AB By bringing computing capabilities to the network edge, mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising technique to enable low-latency video streaming services. However, due to the rapid growth of the number of devices and the heterogeneous formats of the video streams, the traditionally centralized content delivery schemes are insufficient to provide secure, adaptive video services with low complexity. To achieve a decentralized content market among untruthful parties (e.g., users and operators), in this paper, we propose an effective video transcoding and delivery approach based on MEC and blockchain. In the proposed approach, we envision a set of blockchain-based smart contracts to build an autonomous content delivery market, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. Then, users, small base stations (SBSs), and content provider (CP) are able to autonomously adjust their strategies according to the content market statistics. Moreover, we formulate the optimization problem, including resource allocation, determining content price and quality levels of contents, as a three-stage Stackelberg game. We analyze the subgame equilibrium for each stage and the interplays of the three-stage game. Lastly, an iterative algorithm is proposed to obtain the solution. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Under the background of Internet +, the application of enterprise marketing based on blockchain technology is infinite in the future. Through the sharing of consumer data among enterprises, user segmentation and target consumer images become clearer, making it possible to achieve precision marketing. The blockchain technology provides an effective way for consumers to verify the authenticity of products. Enterprises can also enhance customer experience and brand trust and reduce consumption risk. Besides, the business credit system based on blockchain technology makes the transactions among B2B, B2C, and C2C more secure and reliable and promotes the establishment and development of personal credit, corporate social responsibility marketing, and social honesty. At the same time, as a new product of economic development, the application of blockchain technology is still at risk. On the one hand, the risk exists in blockchain technology itself, that is, the breakthrough of new technology may lead to the loss of efficiency of original technologies and the reduction of security, which will make the data be exposed to the possibility of leakage. On the other hand, it comes from the moral hazards of the people who use the technology. If all the people involved in verifying the information admit the "authenticity" of false data, the whole chain will fall into a false trap. The core idea of the block chain is decentralization, but the profit-driven information possession has made the organizations that are already in data oligopoly to realize the complete monopoly of data by establishing the status of main chain and attracting regional links in other fields. It is contrary to the core idea of decentralization of the block chain. This paper analyzes the influence of the blockchain technology on enterprise marketing and the risks of blockchain technology, as a new product of economic development from the perspective of technology, morality and centralization.

AB As cloud services greatly facilitate file sharing online, there's been a growing awareness of the security challenges brought by outsourcing data to a third party. Traditionally, the centralized management of cloud service provider brings about safety issues because the third party is only semi trusted by clients. Besides, it causes trouble for sharing online data conveniently. In this paper, the blockchain technology is utilized for decentralized safety administration and provide more user-friendly service. Apart from that, Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption is introduced as an effective tool to realize fine-grained data access control of the stored files. Meanwhile, the security analysis proves the confidentiality and integrity of the data stored in the cloud server. Finally, we evaluate the performance of computation overhead of our system.

AB Blockchain, as the core technology of cryptocurrency, provides a novel idea for the sharing economy. A user pays the agreed money to the property owner without any trust third party in blockchain, which leads to the leakage of privacy due to openness of the blockchain. To alleviate the privacy concern, a protocol is proposed to not only protect privacy through breaking the link between the user and the property owner but also ensure the fairness among parties joined in transaction. In addition, double-spending and double-usage are detected and prevented by applying smart contract in the protocol. Compared with the existing related works, the proposed protocol is secure, effective and practical.

AB Blockchain is an innovative distributed ledger technology which has attracted a wide range of interests for building the next generation of applications to address lack-of-trust issues in business. Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is a promising solution to improve the productivity of blockchain application development. The existing BaaS solutions mostly focus on easier and faster deployment of blockchain applications. However, design of blockchain applications is challenging to developers as it requires development experiences and deep understanding of blockchain technologies. Therefore, this paper summarises a set of design patterns and delivers them as a service to support design of blockchain application. We present a service platform which applies design patterns for data management and smart contract design of blockchain applications to address the scalability and security issues of blockchain. The platform also provides two auxiliary services, including key management and file comparison, which are often needed in blockchain applications. The feasibility of the proposed solutions is evaluated using a real-world quality tracing use case.

AB The recently emerged blockchain (in particular smart contract) technology offers an enticing opportunity for decentralized sharing economy. Machine learning can be one important subroutine in such a decentralized ecosystem. Unfortunately, machine learning programs are usually computational intensive as well as randomized, which fall into the inherent limitations of open blockchain where complex and randomized programs cannot be executed by the underlying nodes collectively.
   Given also the limitations of existing verifiable computing techniques, we propose a crowdsourcing idea from the game theoretic perspective to resolve the tension. We design a simple incentive mechanism so that the execution of a wide range of complex programs can be crowdsourced via the blockchain, and any false computing result could be deterred. In particular, our protocol works in the scenarios that there is no trusted thirdparty involved; Moreover, our protocol not only works in the classical model of non-colluding service providers, but also can tolerate any potential coalition up to n - 1, where n is the total number of service providers. We also showcase how to use our protocol to crowdsource two typical kinds of machine learning tasks via open blockchain.
   We envision that our solution is not only promising to launch decentralized applications involving a wide range of machine learning programs, but also a stepping stone towards a general way to empowering intensive and randomized computations atop the open blockchain.

AB Open banking brings both the opportunities and challenges to banks all over the world. Due to the different economic development levels of each country and the gaps among financial environment maturity, all countries have different strategies and regulations towards the privacy protection of data in financial scenes, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by European Union (EU). A blockchain as a continuously growing list of records managed by a peer-to-peer network is widely used in various application scenarios, and can protect the privacy of financial data. However, financial blockchain still poses some problems that cannot fully meet the data protection needs. In order to address the existing problems, this paper proposes a new blockchain-based data privacy management framework. The framework consists of three components: a data privacy classification method according to the characteristics of financial data and a new collaborative filtering-based model and a confirmation data disclosure scheme for customer strategies based on the Nudge Theory. We implement a prototype and propose a set of algorithms for this management framework.

AB Risk and Information System Control Framework in business includes the methods and processes to manage risks and seize opportunities which involve identifying particular risk events relevant to the objectives, assessing them in terms of likelihood and magnitude of impact, determining a response strategy, and monitoring progress. In order to provide better support for the backtracking, traceability, irreversibility, and credible requirements of risk registration table data in the framework, this paper proposes a blockchain-based risk and information system control framework A risk association tree is designed for combining summarized risk item ledgers with risk assessment ledgers and risk response ledgers based on the Merkle Tree. Three proposed smart contracts are used in risk identification, risk assessment, risk response and mitigation, and risk and control monitoring and reporting processes. We implement a prototype for this framework.

AB Reserve resources shortage has occurred with the increasing penetration of renewable energy. To share reserve resources and improve operation reliability of interconnected power grids, a reserve sharing mechanism based on block chain is proposed. Probabilistic forecasting scenarios are used to depict stochastic wind and solar generation. Renewable energy curtailment, unserved demand and reserve shortage are considered in the system operation cost. Then Shapley values are calculated as the settlement for external market participants to remunerate reserve capacity, which evaluate the values of the shared reserve resources to the interconnected power grid. Block chain technology is first adopted in reserve sharing for practical implementation to build trust among market participants. Case studies based on the IEEE 57-bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism and models.

AB Virtual currencies are on the rise and so is money laundering. While there are efforts to combat money laundering through various intergovernmental bodies, many have expressed concern over the rise of virtual currencies. Some cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have played a major role in the proliferation of online money laundering as it possesses characteristics that criminals are fond of. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are decentralised, anonymous/ pseudonymous and irreversible. They provide the means to skirt the Anti-Money laundering safeguards that have been put in place.

AB In a few short years the Internet of Things has become an intrinsic part of everyday life, with connected devices included in products created for homes, cars and even medical equipment. But its rapid growth has created several security problems, with respect to the transmission and storage of vast amounts of customers data, across an insecure heterogeneous collection of networks.
   The Internet of Things is therefore creating a unique set of risk and problems that will affect most households. From breaches in confidentiality, which could allow users to be snooped on, through to failures in integrity, which could lead to consumer data being compromised; devices are presenting many security challenges to which consumers are ill equipped to protect themselves from.
   Moreover, when this is coupled with the heterogeneous nature of the industry, and the interoperable and scalability problems it becomes apparent that the Internet of Things has created an increased attack surface from which security vulnerabilities may be easily exploited.
   However, it has been conjectured that blockchain may provide a solution to the Internet of Things security and scalability problems. Because of blockchain's immutability, integrity and scalability, it is possible that its architecture could be used for the storage and transfer of Internet of Things data.
   Within this paper a cross section of blockchain consensus protocols have been assessed against a requirement framework, to establish each consensus protocols strengths and weaknesses with respect to their potential implementation in an Internet of Things blockchain environment.

AB The security of web communication via the SSL/TLS protocols relies on safe distributions of public keys associated with web domains in the form of X.509 certificates. Certificate authorities (CAs) are trusted third parties that issue these certificates. However, the CA ecosystem is fragile and prone to compromises. Starting with Google's Certificate Transparency project, a number of research works have recently looked at adding transparency for better CA accountability, effectively through public logs of all certificates issued by certification authorities, to augment the current X.509 certificate validation process into SSL/TLS.
   In this paper, leveraging recent progress in blockchain technology, we propose a novel system, called CTB, that makes it impossible for a CA to issue a certificate for a domain without obtaining consent from the domain owner. We further make progress to equip CTB with certificate revocation mechanism. We implement CTB using IBM's Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. CTB's smart contract, written in Go, is provided for complete reference.

AB This paper presents a new design approach for Access Control services leveraging smart contracts provided by blockchain technology. The key idea of our proposal is to codify Access Control policies as executable smart contracts on a blockchain. This transforms the policy evaluation process into completely distributed smart contract executions. In our fully blockchain based approach also the Attribute Managers required for the evaluation of the Access Control policies are managed by the blockchain, i.e., they are implemented as smart contracts as well. To study the feasibility of our proposal we present a working reference implementation using XACML policies and Solidity written smart contracts deployed on Ethereum. Finally we evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of the proposal, making also use of experimental results of our reference implementation.

AB Bitcoin has emerged as a disruptive technology able to revolutionize the way financial transactions are performed. The static analysis of the Bitcoin's blockchain conducted jointly with a real time analysis of the Bitcoin's Peer-to-Peer network can reveal interesting properties of the Bitcoin's ecosystem.
   In this paper we propose BitKer, a Bitcoin kernel client able to interact with the Peer-to-Peer network to retrieve information useful to support higher level analyses. BitKer offers an API to applications requiring an interaction with the underlying network, for instance to implement deanonymization strategies. In this work, we present a first set of experimental results obtained by three different logs, the last one of them obtained just after the August 2017 Bitcoin Cash hard fork. Results show that BitKer is effective in retrieving useful information and can be easily used as a basis for more complex analysis tools.

AB Recently, the interest in using Blockchain as a secure and distributed ledger has increased dramatically. Although the main purpose of Blockchain by means of Bitcoin was about cryptocurrency and peer to peer transactions, its application to other systems has been widely used. One of the fields that has potential possibilities to benefit from BlockChain features is telecommunication. BlockChain can be applied in case of management of various networks to reduce some expenses. In this position paper, we apply a BlockChain network with smart contract in the cellular mobile networks. The Blockchain can provide a distributed HSS in a way that the core networks of different operators can use it in a secure manner. Moreover, the smart contract can act as a distributed Self Organizing Network features to handle self-transactions among mobile operators in return of sharing small cells' infrastructure.

AB Blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and their respective P2P networks have seen significant adoption in many sectors in the past few years. All these technologies that use the Blockchain pattern show that it is possible to rebuild any transactional system with better performance without relying on any trusted parties to manage transactions between peers. This insight has lead many companies to invest millions to understand the technology and to find a way to migrate from centralized to decentralized solutions.
   These solutions need to store large amounts of data in a secure and confidential way. Many distributed storage systems now exist using Blockchain technology. But none of the tools proposed are able to manage the document life cycle nor archive documents based on regulatory compliance.
   In this paper, we describe our protocol named NFB (Notarizing Files over the Blockchain). This protocol ensures the communication between two systems: a permissive Blockchain and a secured centralized archiving document management system. The method described is used to allow users to archive, control, analyze and validate their transactions in a system that offers confidentiality, security and distribution features.

AB Insurances are a way of financial risk mitigation that pay the user in case of damage. However, once the event happens, the user does not get paid immediately due to the large degree of human interaction required. In this paper, we automate insurance payment by using smart contracts. As additional contribution, our design supports integration of IoT devices to register events that trigger insurance contracts and offers additional privacy-protection even on public blockchains. In order to allow users to retrieve their payment from the insurance contract anonymously we remove the linkability and traceability between events that triggers the contract and the insurance holder by applying ring signatures. Using a prototypical implementation based on Ethereum, we study the additional overhead and cost that our design incurs and can show that exploiting latest features of Ethereum, gas cost can be driven down substantially compared to earlier approaches. In sum, we propose, implement, and evaluate a design for smart insurance contracts integrating IoT sensors and including additional privacy protection using ring signatures.

AB Chemical companies must find new paths to success in a changing environment. In particular, this will involve exploiting the potential of digital technologies. However, the full integration and intelligent interconnection of systems and processes is only making slow progress. This contribution aims to encourage the more comprehensive use of digitization in the process industry based on smart sensors, actuators, and communications, and informs about current technical possibilities such as the "one-network paradigm", ad-hoc connections, edge computing, FPGAs, virtual machines and blockchain. These offer a new scope for smart sensors, actuators, and communications.

AB Authentication and revocation of users in Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETS) are two vital security aspects. It is extremely important to perform these actions promptly and efficiently. The past works addressing these issues lack in mitigating the reliance on the centralized trusted authority and therefore do not provide distributed and decentralized security. This paper proposes a blockchain based authentication and revocation framework for vehicular networks, which not only reduces the computation and communication overhead by mitigating dependency on a trusted authority for identity verification, but also speedily updates the status of revocated vehicles in the shared blockchain ledger. In the proposed framework, vehicles obtain their Pseudo IDs from the Certificate Authority (CA), which are stored along with their certificate in the immutable authentication blockchain and the pointer corresponding to the entry in blockchain, enables the Road Side Units (RSUs) to verify the identity of a vehicle on road. The efficiency and performance of the framework has been validated using the Omnet++ simulation environment.

AB An increased incidence of food mislabeling and handling in recent years has led to consumers demanding transparency in how food items are produced and handled. The current traceability solutions suffer from issues such as scattering of information across multiple silos and susceptibility in recording erroneous data and thus are often unable to produce reliable farm to fork stories of products. Blockchain (BC) is a promising technology that could play an important role in providing data transparency and integrity due to its salient features which include decentralisation, immutability and auditability. In this paper, we propose a permissioned blockchain framework which is governed by a consortium of key Food Supply Chain (FSC) entities including government and regulatory bodies to promote food provenance. We propose to use a sharded, three-tiered architecture which ensures availability of data to consumers, limits access to competitive partners and provides scalability for handling transaction load. We also propose a transaction vocabulary and access rights to manage read and write privileges to BC supported by the consortium. The framework, ProductChain, ensures that trade flows are kept confidential when provenance information is retrieved by consumers and stakeholders. Simulation results show that query time for a product ledger is of the order of a few milliseconds even when the information is collated from multiple shards. ProductChain is generalised and applicable to supply chains in diverse industries.

AB Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform released to open-source and hosted by the Linux Foundation. The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise grade business applications like supply-chains, financial transactions, asset management, food safety, and many more. For that end HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general purpose languages (chaincode in HLF), and flexible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid.
   Typical blockchain applications are comprised of two tiers: the first tier focuses on the modelling of the data schema and embedding of business rules into the blockchain by means of smart contracts (chaincode) and endorsment policies; and the second tier uses the SDK (Software Development Kit) provided by HLF to implement client side application logic.
   However there is a gap between the two tiers that hinders the rapid adoption of changes in the chaincode and endorsement policies within the client SDK. Currently, the chaincode location and endorsement policies are statically configured into the client SDK. This limits the reliability and availability of the client in the event of changes in the platform, and makes the platform more difficult to use. In this work we address and bridge the gap by describing the design and implementation of Service Discovery.
   Service Discovery provides APIs which allow dynamic discovery of the configuration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform, alleviating the client from the burden of maintaining it. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus significantly improving the reliability of the application layer. It also makes the HLF platform more consumable, simplifying the job of creating blockchain applications.

AB Open proxies forward traffic on behalf of any Internet user. Listed on open proxy aggregator sites, they are often used to bypass geographic region restrictions or circumvent censorship. Open proxies sometimes also provide a weak form of anonymity by concealing the requestor's IP address.
   To better understand their behavior and performance, we conducted a comprehensive study of open proxies, encompassing more than 107,000 listed open proxies and 13M proxy requests over a 50 day period. While previous studies have focused on malicious open proxies' manipulation of HTML content to insert/modify ads, we provide a more broad study that examines the availability, success rates, diversity, and also (mis)behavior of proxies.
   Our results show that listed open proxies suffer poor availability-more than 92% of open proxies that appear on aggregator sites are unresponsive to proxy requests. Much more troubling, we find numerous examples of malicious open proxies in which HTML content is manipulated to mine cryptocurrency (that is, cryptojacking). We additionally detect TLS man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, and discover numerous instances in which binaries fetched through proxies were modified to include remote access trojans and other forms of malware. As a point of comparison, we conduct and discuss a similar measurement study of the behavior of Tor exit relays. We find no instances in which Tor relays performed TLS MitM or manipulated content, suggesting that Tor offers a far more reliable and safe form of proxied communication.

AB Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS) are highly cognitive, reflective, multitask-able, and effective in knowledge discovery. Examples of IAS include software systems that are capable of automatic reconfiguration, autonomous vehicles, network of sensors with reconfigurable sensory platforms, and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) respecting privacy by deciding to turn off its camera when pointing inside a private residence. Research is needed to build systems that can monitor their environment and interactions, learn their capabilities and limitations, and adapt to meet the mission objectives with limited or no human intervention. The systems should be fail-safe and should allow for graceful degradations while continuing to meet the mission objectives. In this paper, we provide an overview of our proposed new methodologies and workflows, and survey the existing approaches and new ones that can advance the science of autonomy in smart systems through enhancements in real-time control, auto-reconfigurability, monitoring, adaptability, and trust. This paper also provides the theoretical framework behind IAS.

AB Although human evolution was primarily driven and inspired by observing nature and natural phenomena, little to no effort was allocated to finding ways in which we can integrate the solutions nature has to offer in the way we organize ourselves as a society and the way we make decisions as individuals or groups. Decision making, as a concrete manifestation of our will, is the fundamental process that allows for meaningful change to happen. Optimizing the way we make decisions and creating correlations between the decisions we make, the actions implied by those decisions and the effects the actions bring on the governed body (individual or group) will allow us to improve both the way we make decisions and the outcome of our decisions, while at the same time help us to identify the primary directives that need to be considered as fundamental parameters when making decisions that affect organic life, with the intention of reaching a consensus, in the form of a universal wise normative that will be unanimously accepted by all humans regardless of gender, nationality, religion etc. For such a consensus to be found we need to identify the natural distinctions that give life its diversity but at the same time acknowledge and understand the existence of the point where everything converges to form a unified and heterogenetic organism. For this scope we will present the solutions nature offers that can be integrated into an actual platform that will fundamentally change the way we govern ourselves as a society and as individuals.

AB Cash-less payment via a variety of credit, debit or prepaid cards is pervasive in our interconnected society, but not so ubiquitous in remote rural regions where network connectivity is intermittent. We proposed a cash-less payment scheme for remote villages based on blockchains that allow maintaining a record of verifiable transactions in a distributed manner. We overcome the limitations of intermittent network connectivity by solely relying on blockchain mining nodes in the village for transaction processing and verification. The bank joins as a peer and monitors node behaviors, rewards miners and processes currency exchanges whenever the connectivity is available. We take advantage of the Ethereum network to develop our solution and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system on off-the-shelf computing devices. We emulate a remote village scenario with intermittent network connectivity and show the robustness and reliability of the proposed system.

AB Today, Machine learning (ML)/Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the way through which data is perceived. Enterprises are using ML models to gain insights from the data and build applications of highest quality and accuracy. In this process, they are trying to seek more data to derive robust conclusions. However, relevant data are privately held and resides with an organization's premise which thwarts the development of accurate models. Decentralized AI has become an attractive technological trend for enterprises as it ensures model improvement and creates a demand for them through a marketplace. Nonetheless, its potential can be unleashed if there is a massive user participation enabled through fair rewards to its contributors.
   Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we present DInEMMo, a solution that is built on the convergence of decentralized AI and Blockchain. DInEMMo is enabled with configurable smart contracts with the following features: (1) represent the ML model and use case attributes, (2) generation of models (new/enhanced) based on user input, (3) compute the price of the ML model based on the user policy, and (4) calculate the incentives to the model's owner and co-contributors. Using these features, we qualitatively evaluate the relevancy of the system for the use case on Medical Diagnostics and show the significance of domain specific properties in rewarding the contributors and further, determining the model price.

AB Cryptocurrencies and their foundation technology, the Blockchain, are reshaping finance and economics, allowing a decentralized approach enabling trusted applications with no trusted counterpart. More recently, the Blockchain and the programs running on it, called Smart Contracts, are also finding more and more applications in all fields requiring trust and sound certifications. Some people have come to the point of saying that the "Blockchain revolution" can be compared to that of the Internet and the Web in their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. The feeling of many software engineers about such huge interest in Blockchain technologies is that of unruled and hurried software development, a sort of competition on a first-come-first-served basis which does not assure neither software quality, nor that the basic concepts of software engineering are taken into account.
   This paper tries to cope with this issue, proposing a software development process to gather the requirement, analyze, design, develop, test and deploy Blockchain applications. The process is based on several Agile practices, such as User Stories and iterative and incremental development based on them. However, it makes also use of more formal notations, such as some UML diagrams describing the design of the system, with additions to represent specific concepts found in Blockchain development. The method is described in good detail, and an example is given to show how it works.

AB Electronic Cash (EC) is still suffering from being difficult to transfer values as a digital stream on open channels. The fact that a value stream of bits is often traceable, anonymity and protection against double-spending becomes a very difficult task. In physical cash, coins and bills are exchanged physically persons resulting with assured transport of value by the fact that the physical transfer of money assures no possibility for duplication. Block-chaining technique in Bitcoin attempts to prohibit doubling by majority observation with also a limited success in anonymity and double spending issues. We introduce a new concept for E-Coin circulations by prohibiting the knowledge of the coins to any exchanging party. The only one who knows the coins is the minting authority considered as a trusted authority. The coins are made only possible to identify without being able to see them in critical exchange phases by the exchanging parties, thus prohibiting doubling of coins. The key idea of the new concept is to store the coins in unclonable physical Electronic-Wallets (UEW). The coins can be provably transferred without being seen by users. The UEWs can only be used to verify, accommodate and exchange coins only between wallets under the sole control of the users. Users and manufacturers and even Trusted Authorities TAs have no possibilities to clone UEW and duplicate E-coins. The concept is both bio-inspired regarding unclonable entities and physical-cash-inspired as only the minting banks can duplicate coins and bills. The new E-Coin concept is based on using Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) in a new form as digital Secret Unknown Cipher (SUC).

AB Online portals include an increasing amount of user feedback in form of ratings and reviews. Recent research highlighted the importance of this feedback and confirmed that positive feedback improves product sales figures and thus its success. Online portals' operators act as central authorities throughout the overall review process. In the worst case, operators can exclude users from submitting reviews, modify existing reviews, and introduce fake reviews by fictional users. This paper presents REVIEWCHAIN, a decentralized review approach. Our approach avoids central authorities by using blockchain technologies, decentralized apps and storage. It enables users to submit and retrieve untampered reviews. We high-light the implementation challenges encountered when realizing our approach on the public Ethereum blockchain. Then, we discuss possible design alternatives and their trade-offs regarding costs, security, and trustworthiness. Finally, we analyze which design decision should be chosen to support specific trade-offs and present resulting combinations of decentralized blockchain technologies, also with conventional centralized technologies.

AB In a Futures-Exchange, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, traders buy and sell contractual promises (futures) to acquire or deliver, at some future pre-specified date, assets ranging from wheat to crude oil and from bacon to cash in a desired currency. The interactions between economic and security properties and the exchange's essentially non-monotonic security behavior; a valid trader's valid action can invalidate other traders' previously valid positions, are a challenge for security research.
   We show the security properties that guarantee an Exchange's economic viability (availability of trading information, liquidity, confidentiality of positions, absence of price discrimination, risk-management) and an attack when traders' anonymity is broken.
   We describe all key operations for a secure, fully distributed Futures-Exchange, hereafter referred to as simply the 'Exchange'. Our distributed, asynchronous protocol simulates the centralized functionality under the assumptions of anonymity of the physical layer and availability of a distributed ledger. We consider security with abort (in absence of honest majority) and extend it to penalties. Our proof of concept implementation and its optimization (based on zk-SNARKs and SPDZ) demonstrate that the computation of actual trading days (along Thomson-Reuters Tick History DB) is feasible for low-frequency markets; however, more research is needed for high-frequency ones.

AB Blockchain has proven to be a disruptive technology having a tremendous impact on cryptocurrencies management. The blockchain technology potential is one to be applied in other fields. The development of new/small/cheap SoC processors boards will systematically flood our homes, businesses, buildings and cities with Internet connection capable devices. The M2AP is an architecture that proposes a unified and micromanage ecosystem for these devices. Fully interconnected like a network mesh but better prepare to control the data flow due to its device classification based on purpose and data usage. In this paper it is proposed an M2AP architecture that uses blockchain for identity identification, security and trust delivery management applied to a home automation system. A Trust currency is introduced, a modified blockchain structure is utilized, and a proof of Trust is presented.

AB This chapter discusses the form of autonomous decentralized software known as the blockchain. It covers the original usage of blockchain distributed ledger technology, a part of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It summarizes the functional software architecture of blockchain that provides secure and uninterruptible service. It briefly discusses the growth and proliferation of cryptocurrencies throughout the economy. The main focus of the section is the application of blockchain technology beyond currencies, as a disintermediating force in various industries, such as finance, healthcare, publishing, and software, including the potential for widespread distributed, autonomous organizations, based on smart contracts built on the blockchain technology.
   While the technology is complicated and the word blockchain isn't exactly sonorous, the main idea is simple. Blockchains enable us to send money directly and safely from me to you, without going through a bank, a credit card company, or PayPal. Rather than the Internet of Information, it's the Internet of Value or of Money. It's also a platform for everyone to know what is true-at least with regard to structured recorded information [1].

AB Bitcoin and Smart Contract are the first major applications of the BlockChain technology. But, with increasing the number of transactions, the process of verification on every transaction is very slow. This is the reason for a third major innovation called a BlockChain scaling. The scalability is a process of taking certain steps in accelerating the performing of transactions in this new technology.
   In this paper we analyze the possibilities for BlockChain scalability and we examine the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed solutions.

AB X.509 certificates underpin the security of the Internet economy, notably secure web servers, and they need to be revoked promptly and reliably once they are compromised. The original revocation method specified in the X.509 standard, to distribute certificate revocation lists (CRLs), is both old and untrustworthy. CRLs are susceptible to attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle and Denial of Service. The newer Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and OCSP-stapling approaches have well-known drawbacks as well.
   The primary contribution of this paper is Secure Revocation as a Peer Service (SCRaaPS). SCRaaPS is an alternative, reliable way to support X.509 certificate revocation via the Scrybe secure provenance system. The blockchain support of Scrybe enables the creation of a durable, reliable revocation service that can withstand Denial-of-Service attacks and ensures non-repudiation of certificates revoked. We provide cross-CA-revocation information and address the additional problem of intermediate-certificate revocation with the knock-on effects on certificates derived thereof.
   A Cuckoo filter provides quick, communication-free testing by servers and browsers against our current revocation list (with no false negatives). A further contribution of this work is that the revocation service can fit in as a drop-in replacement for OCSP-stapling with superior performance and coverage both for servers and browsers. Potential revocation indicated by our Cuckoo filter is backed up by rigorous service query to eliminate false positives. Cuckoo filter parameters are also stored in our blockchain to provide open access to this algorithmic option for detection.
   We describe the advantages of using a blockchain-based system and, in particular, the approach to distributed ledger technology and lightweight mining enabled by Scrybe, which was designed with secure provenance in mind.

AB Contracts, a set of legally negotiated rules between the transacting parties are often the prime cause of legal as well as business disputes. Due to this discord, they are generally viewed with contempt. The need to revolutionize contracts has been much felt by the attorneys and the business professionals, so as to avoid these daedal contract conflicts. This resulted in the advent of smart contracts that was led by Blockchain technology. It is a blend of legalese from lawyers and computer code. A smart contract is a versatile system capable of facilitating, automating and enforcing an agreement (i.e. contract). In this paper, we preview as well as analyze smart contract based on blockchain technology for a decentralized system.

AB Blockchain based cryptocurrencies are usually unmanaged, distributed, consensus-based systems in which no single entity has control. Managed cryptocurrencies can be implemented using private blockchains but are fundamentally different as the owners have complete control to do arbitrary activity without transparency (since they control the mining). In this work we explore a hybrid approach where a managed cryptocurrency is maintained through distributed consensus based methods. The currency administrator can perform ongoing management functions while the consensus methods enforce the rules of the cryptocurrency and provide transparency for all management actions. This enables the introduction of money management features common in fiat currencies but where the managing entity cannot perform arbitrary actions and transparency is enforced. We thus eliminate the need for users to trust the currency administrator but also to enable the administrator to manage the cryptocurrency. We demonstrate how to implement our approach through modest modifications to the implicit Bitcoin specification, however, our approach can be applied to most any blockchain based cryptocurrency using a variety of consensus methods.

AB This paper enlightens the stipulation of blockchain beyond the bitcoin and identifies the key challenges in the implementation of blockchain on a small scale or newly implemented projects based on the literature review, furthermore it also introduces Block maturity level (BML) as a Consensus protocol, which eliminates the 51% attack, the hardfork problem and small-scale problem by introducing sub-blocks as a defense mechanism against attackers. This technique can be used in the implementation of blockchain where the hash power and difficulty is lower and easy to match-up. This proposed consensus protocol would immensely secure the implementation of the blockchain on different projects.

AB Blockchain is the one of leading technology of this time; it has started to revolutionize several fields like, finance, business, industry, smart home, healthcare, social networks, Internet and the Internet of Things. It has many benefits like, decentralized network, robustness, availability, stability, anonymity, auditability and accountability. The applications of Blockchain are emerging, and it is found that most of the work is focused on its engineering implementation. While the theoretical part is very less considered and explored. In this paper we implemented the simulation of mining process in Blockchain based systems using queuing theory. We took the parameters of one of the mature Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin's real data and simulated using M/ M/ n/ L queuing system in JSIMgraph. We have achieved realistic results; and expect that it will open up new research direction in theoretical research of Blockchain based systems.

The core of the blockchain model assures non-repudiation possible by any of the involved information producers thus maintaining ledger fidelity of the enclosed historical process information. One important side effect of this data infrastructure is that it can be accessed in open form, for research purposes for instance, since no individual re-identification or group profiling is possible by any means.

AB A secure communications infrastructure featuring email, chat, and a MIPR application was developed to a proof of concept level using a blockchain database to store the contents. The blockchain, which already provides a completely secure method of exchanging cryptocurrencies, can be extended to any transactional or communications paradigm. Email applications are described in which application-level standard protocols (e.g. SMTP, POP3, IMAP) were enhanced to optionally allow messages to be routed through a blockchain using familiar client applications such as MS Outlook or Thunderbird. Chat applications are discussed similarly, using the IRC protocol and a custom web-based protocol based on Socket. IO. A MIPR application is also featured where the ability of multiple parties to sign documents and release funds is illustrated.

AB Tor hidden services have grown too rapidly so that anonymous users cannot verify the authenticity of Hidden Services. Meanwhile, there are many unsafe factors in the centralized directory management mode, and the service content and configuration can be detected and monitored by automated scripts. Faced with the above problems, this paper based on the current Tor domain name communication management model, proposed a new Hidden Service Domain Name System-HSDNS, which using SOR node decentralized management, then replace the top-level domain name as ".hs" to increase the anti-scanning property of the original domain name, introduces the PoW competition mechanism to enable registrants to get readable unique domain name among the whole network. On this basis, the random number provided by the BTC blockchain guarantees random competition and enhances the anti-registration attack, in the meantime, Merkle Tree hash detection mechanism is used to open verification service of domain authenticity, and finally verify model analysis results through the ExperimenTor simulation platform, and it shows that HSDNS model has decentralized management, service anti-scanning, domain name uniqueness and authenticity verification and so on.

AB With the great success of Bitcoin, the blockchain, as its key underlying teclmology, has been paid more and more concern. However, the Proof-of-Work(PoW) mechanism used by Bitcoin requires long confirmation time and wastes more computing resource. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), as another important protocol that has been widely used, which can tolerate at most 1/3 corruptions, meanwhile confirm transactions with quick speed In fact, it is difficult to Implement and maintain it with a large-scale setting. In this paper, considering a permissioned setting, we propose a Byzantine protocol based on the conunittee, and elect a committee to reach the consensus on behalf of all participants. In steady state, our protocol uses PBFT to approve transactions among all members of the conunittee. In election state, we use an efficient election algorithm which can combine the latest consensus results with the partletpants authentication information to elect a new committee. Our protocol improves on Bitcoin in confirmation time and provides safety and Iiveness on the condition of the amount of Byzantine participants are less than 1/3.

AB The Blockchain technology is currently considered as a major paradigm shift in software architectures and applications. Indeed, it enables the automation of business worflows, using smart contracts, and hence the collaboration between trustless entities, without having to rely on any centralized or third parties. In this context, the automated generation of smart contracts, from high level business process models, has recently received increased interests within the research community. In this paper, we introduce the Blockchain Studio framework, which is a fork of Caterpillar, and whose objective is to enable the generation and automation of role-based business workflows on Ethereum based blockchains. The architecture and implementation of Blockchain Studio are firstly discussed, followed by the analysis of the achieved benefits on a practical use case related to the management of vehicles' life-cycles and data history. Various research challenges and opportunities are then highlighted.

TI Electronic Platforms: Openness, Transparency & Privacy Issues
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB Any discussion of the legal issues surrounding blockchain technologies seems doomed from the outset. The sheer amount and complexity of technical terms, which are often used inconsistently, precludes an exhaustive and disciplined analysis of the potential legal problems that could arise from the widespread, commercial use of blockchains. Consequently, the evaluation of the popular claims hailing blockchains as enablers of commerce is extremely challenging. Additional complications arise from the fact that blockchain technologies are accompanied by multiple ideological concepts that, at times, seem to preclude logical reasoning. Terms such as 'decentralization' or 'trustlessness' are presented as ultimate values that must be strived towards at any cost - even if their full implementation leads to commercially undesirable results. Acknowledging the practical impossibility to provide a thorough explanation of the relevant technological concepts and to surmount claims that 'commerce must be decentralized', this article provides an overview of the different types of blockchains and presents their practical shortcomings. It focuses on the division between permissionless and permissioned blockchains to demonstrate that only the latter could potentially serve as electronic platforms supporting a wide range of commercial transactions. The main point made in this article is that technology, irrespective of its sophistication, cannot exist without a supporting legal infrastructure - and without regard to legal requirements.

AB Usage of IoT marketplaces as central components in distributed systems have become common, as they allow for easy exploitation of other services and data sources. When relying on a marketplace to be available in order for a system to be operational, it is critical that the marketplace operation is highly robust. Marketplaces are typically centralized components which means that single point of failure is a possible issue. Also users of the marketplace must trust the operator to be fair and follow a common set of rules. This work proposes to utilize blockchain technology to realize a distributed marketplace where both functionalities and storage are distributed and thereby increasing availability to users, while removing the need for a central operator. The blockchain also makes the operational rules transparent to the users of the marketplace. In this relation two core marketplace functionalities, offering creation and discovery, are realized using smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain and evaluated using an experimental testbed. The results demonstrate the feasibility of a blockchain based marketplace implementation.

Algorithm analysis is connected with the Mempool component of the aforementioned system, which is responsible for disseminating data through the network. It is currently implemented in a way that it guarantees a certain outcome, yet it produces a large overhead. Simulation will show that one of the proposed solutions reduces the redundancy by 56.53% (or 3.62 times) on average, which is a significant improvement.

TI Designing blockchain-based SIEM 3.0 system
SO INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SECURITY
AB Purpose Nowadays, to operate securely and legally and to achieve business objectives, secure valuable assets and support uninterrupted business processes, all organizations need to match a lot of internal and external compliance regulations such as laws, standards, guidelines, policies, specifications and procedures. An integrated system able to manage information security (IS) for their intranets in the new cyberspace while processing tremendous amounts of IS-related data coming in various formats is required as never before. These data, after being collected and analyzed, should be evaluated in real-time from an IS incident viewpoint, to identify an incident's source, consider its type, weigh its consequences, visualize its vector, associate all target systems, prioritize countermeasures and offer mitigation solutions with weighted impact relevance. Different security information and event management (SIEM) systems cope with this routine and usually complicated work by rapid detection of IS incidents and further appropriate response. Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the blockchain (BC) technologies (BCTs). The purpose of this study is to design a new BC-based SIEM 3.0 system and propose a methodology for its evaluation.
   Design/methodology/approach Modern challenges dictate the need to build these systems using advanced technologies such as the BC technologies. Many internet resources argue that the BCT suits the intrusion detection objectives very well, but they do not mention how to implement it.
   Findings After a brief analysis of the BC concept and the evolution of SIEM systems, this paper presents the main ideas on designing the next-generation BC-based SIEM 3.0 systems, for the first time in open access publications, including a convolution method for solving the scalability issue for ever-growing BC size. This new approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future.
   Research limitations/implications The most important area of the future work is to bring this proposed system to life. The implementation, deployment and testing onto a real-world network would also allow people to see its viability or show that a more sophisticated model should be worked out. After developing the design basics, we are ready to determine the directions of the most promising studies. What are the main criteria and principles, according to which the organization will select events from PEL for creating one BC block? What is the optimal number of nodes in the organization's BC, depending on its network assets, services provided and the number of events that occur in its network? How to build and host the SIEM 3.0 BC infrastructure? How to arrange streaming analytics of block's content containing events taking place in the network? How to design the BC middleware as software that enables staff to interact with BC blocks to provide services like IS events correlation? How to visualize the results obtained to find insights and patterns in historical BC data for better IS management? How to predict the emergence of IS events in the future? This list of questions can be continued indefinitely for a full-fledged design of SIEM 3.0.
   Practical implications This paper shows the full applicability of the BC concept to the creation of the next-generation SIEM 3.0 systems that are designed to detect IS incidents in a modern, fully interconnected organization's network environment. The authors' attempt to begin with a detailed description of the basics for a BC-based SIEM 3.0 system design is presented, as well as the evaluation methodology for the resulting product.
   Originality/value The authors believe that their new revolutionary approach makes it possible not to simply modify SIEM systems in an evolutionary manner, but to bring their next generation to a qualitatively new and higher level of IS event management in the future. They hope that this paper will evoke a lively response in this segment of the security controls market from both theorists and direct developers of living systems that will implement the above approach.

AB The phases those turn the wheels of an autonomous vehicle, are perception, decision and actuation. Among these, the major highlight of recent research has been perception through diverse sensors, and decision through an ever-aggressive cloud/fog/mist computing setup. In this paper, we take a closer look into the flow of data, both internal and external to the autonomous vehicle. We argue that confidentiality, integrity and availability of these data are critical to the eventual adoption of higher-level security and privacy mechanisms in autonomous vehicles. To that effect, we propose a secure and tamper-resilient distributed ledger as an underlying enabler for intra-vehicular data aggregation, and study its security and privacy issues under appropriate adversarial models, where the distributed ledger is instantiated as a standard consortium blockchain.

AB The emergence of a "post-fact" world has seen knowledge being misinterpreted and manipulated to suit diverse purposes. Information from credible sources is often drowned out by 'facts' with dubious provenance. It is not enough to simply establish knowledge provenance if this meta-data can be changed afterwards. This paper presents a possible solution using blockchains to manage knowledge provenance. The solution is modelled using a concrete example of knowledge institutions. Variations and extensions to suit other domains are suggested. Particularly, a graph based variation of the blockchain is outlined. We also discuss the impact of our model beyond technology.

TI Blockchain & Data Protection ... and Why They Are Not on a Collision
   Course
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB Recent publications on the data protection aspects of blockchain technology focus on the characteristics of the initial public (Bitcoin) blockchain, and do so in a generalized manner. The authors then conclude that the characteristics of a public blockchain are profoundly incompatible at a conceptual level with the principles of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR requires identification of a central 'controller' who is responsible for compliance with the GDPR, while a public blockchain decentralizes the storage and processing of personal data, as a result whereof there is no such central point of control. For lack of a better alternative, the authors conclude that all 'nodes' involved in operating a blockchain qualify as a controller under the GDPR, raising enforcement and jurisdictional issues that make it impossible for individuals to enforce their rights. The transparency and immutability of a public blockchain would further not sit well with principles of data confidentiality, data minimization, data accuracy and the rights of individuals to correction and deletion of their data.
   I disagree with the analysis of these authors for a host of different reasons, the main one being that the authors focus on the shortcomings of the initial public (Bitcoin) blockchain when already many new types of permissioned private and consortium blockchain have been developed that significantly diverge from the original, permissionless public blockchain. In fact, these types of permissioned blockchain have been developed in response to the shortcomings of public blockchain. The authors further consider the data processing implications of blockchain as if this technology constitutes in itself a data processing activity for which a controller has to be identified. Controllership is, however, decided based on a specific use or deployment of a certain technology. Blockchain, like the internet, is a general-purpose technology that is subsequently deployed by actors for a certain purpose in a specific context. Applying the question of controllership to the internet at large would pose similar data protection issues under the GDPR as identified by the authors in respect of blockchain. This publication explains why none of these issues are currently hampering application of the GDPR to the internet and are equally unlikely to pose issues for blockchain applications. This publication describes the issues in their broader context, as well as how each of these issues can be addressed to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The conclusion is that the GDPR is also well able to regulate this new technology. This does not, however, mean that blockchain will thus be suitable for all use and deployment cases.

AB The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a large and complex domain. These systems are often constructed using a very diverse set of hardware, software and protocols. This, combined with the ever increasing number of IoT solutions/services that are rushed to market means that most such systems are rife with security holes. Recent incidents (e.g., the Mirai botnet) further highlight such security issues.
   With emerging technologies such as blockchain and software-defined networks (SDNs), new security solutions are possible in the IoT domain. In this paper we will explore future trends in IoT security: (a) the use of blockchains in IoT security, (b) data provenance for sensor information, (c) reliable and secure transport mechanisms using SDNs (d) scalable authentication and remote attestation mechanisms for IoT devices and (e) threat modeling and risk/maturity assessment frameworks for the domain.

AB This paper shows the prediction of fluctuation in the future price of cryptocurrencies. Users' comments and tweets from twitter using Apache Flume and Price data was fetched from exchanges. Bitcoin first documented by allies Satoshi Nakamoto, the first decentralized currency payment system has gained a considerable attention in the financial system, economics, social media and computer science due to its combination of peer-to-peer nature, encryption technology, and monetary unit. Predicting the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is a great challenge because it is immensely complex and dynamic in nature. In this paper, we have tried to predict the future price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and used Twitter data to predict public mood. By combining both market sentiment and social sentiment because bitcoin price shows mixed properties. We also have selected some other important features from the blockchain information which has a major impact on Bitcoin's supply and demand and using them to train model that improves the predictive power of the future Bitcoin price. We have performed a deep study of how data from social media affect the price of Bitcoin and so we have included the twitter data in model training. Our model shows that how well LSTM predict the price of Bitcoin considering the high volatility. The precision given by our model is 60% and accuracy is 50%. More focus is not given to accuracy, in this case, considering the highly volatile market.

AB Blockchain is one of the technology that has created a disruptive change in many industries. Currently, Blockchain is being used in several places and there are many more applications of Blockchain yet to be discovered and implemented. Blockchain is characterized by its decentralized nature, integrity of the data stored in the chain and its openness. Due to these characteristics, another place where Blockchain can be used is to release government funds for a project. Usually when a project is allocated funds, there is no knowledge as to how these funds are being used and a large part of it is never shown in records due to corruption. To solve this problem, a system has been proposed using Blockchain to provide the transparency. This paper also gives a description about a prototype which was developed using Hyperledger Composer. It then discusses the future development of this prototype and finally, concludes with the applicability of Blockchain.

AB This paper proposes a solution to facilitate on-orbit satellite communication data integrity and security by utilizing blockchain technology. A proliferating demand has created a growing reliance on satellites for communications, GPS, imagery, and other uses. The decreased cost of entry into the space industry has increased the number of entrants and also the number of satellites and the amount of space debris. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to spacecraft. Therefore, tracking these objects is crucial. Blockchain technology offers a unique solution to this problem by utilizing functions, processes, and information already incorporated into satellites while maintaining a maximum of forty-eight hours of data. The use of blockchain provides a high level of trusted positional data that can be used to predict and avoid collisions which will save billions of dollars and valuable time. This paper provides a technological design, rational, and risk analysis of this proposal.

AB Recently, blockchain has attracted a great interest, and today it is considered not only as an innovative technology, but as a potential revolution for the world of business. The motivation of this enthusiasm is due to its capability of enabling new forms of records-keeping, transactions, and interactions between decentralized and mistrusting entities. Indeed, blockchain is driving companies to huge investments and strategic acquisitions, and it is raising innovation and research across industries and academia. However, besides the opportunities offered, this technology may expose institutions and interacting parties to new risks that have to be discovered, understood, and, where possible, eliminated or at least reduced. In this paper we identify the main threats of blockchain and assess their related impact. Then, applying a NIST-compliant approach, we perform a qualitative risk assessment. Finally, we review the possible countermeasures, where existing, for each threat analyzed, and discuss open challenges and future directions.

AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger system composed of a P2P network and is used for a wide range of applications, such as international remittance, inter-individual transactions, and asset conservation. In Blockchain systems, tamper resistance is enhanced by the property of transaction that cannot be changed or deleted by everyone including the creator of the transaction. However, this property also becomes a problem that unintended transaction created by miss operation or secret key theft cannot be corrected later. Due to this problem, once an illegal transaction such as theft occurs, the damage will expand. To suppress the damage, we need countermeasures, such as detecting illegal transaction at high speed and correcting the transaction before approval. However, abnormality detection in the Blockchain at high speed is computationally heavy, because we need to repeat the detection process using various feature quantities and the feature extractions become overhead. In this paper, to accelerate abnormality detection, we propose to cache transaction information necessary for extracting feature in GPU device memory and perform both feature extraction and abnormality detection in the GPU. We employ abnormality detection using K-means algorithm based on the conditional features. When the number of users is one million and the number of transactions is 100 millions, our proposed method achieves 37.1 times faster than CPU processing method and 16.1 times faster than GPU processing method that does not perform feature extraction on the GPU.

AB This is a preliminary study on the issues which relate to the technology adoption of virtual currency systems. Recently, the use of electronic forms of payments and financing have been increasing rapidly as the technology such as a smartcard, a biometric, a 2D optical code, and so on, have gained more sophistication with the ubiquitous usage of smartphones. Furthermore, the virtual currency systems such as blockchain crypto-currency are expected to accelerate the use of mobile payment services involving more users who were not early adopters of these smart technologies. This preliminary study investigates the potential user's behaviors in the adoption of the Smart Payment System (SPS). By asking questions of the Big-Five personality traits together with the questions of the Technology Acceptance Model to Japanese university students, 102 responses were collected. This study is a research-in-progress using Smart PLS-SEM about the adoption mechanism of SPS utilizing the data mentioned above.

AB Even with the ability to produce documents digitally, the paperless environment has yet to become a reality in South Africa. Hardcopy documents are still printed daily which makes them susceptible to document fraud. In South Africa, a case was reported recently, where someone who was creating fake documents was exposed. This introduces the challenge when using hardcopy documents which is loss of integrity. Thus, it is vital to have systems in place to verify document integrity and be able to determine when a document has been tampered with. Various techniques have been used to secure documents, yet the challenge persists. The combination of 2D barcodes, digital signatures, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), cryptographic hashing has proved the potential to achieve good results when combined. Recently, blockchain has been added as one of the techniques to be employed for document verification. This paper presents a proposed solution that incorporates the combination of 2D barcodes, OCR, cryptographic hashing and blockchain. As this is still on-going work, experiments are still required to demonstrate the viability of the solution.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing research attention and practitioner interest in exploring the suitability of Blockchain technology for decentralised applications in multiple domains. This paper investigates the application of Blockchain technology to address some of the key challenges faced by the domain of Social Business (SB). SB is a business model for investments in social causes for the socio-economic development of under-privileged communities. We have modelled a small example of micro-credit use-case from microfinance activities of SB using a semi-formal modelling approach using Blockchain technology. We identified that the Blockchain technology provide solutions that enhance trust, transparency and auditability in SB activities. However, we have also identified challenges related to creating a native cryptocurrency for SB, and barriers to infrastructure and technology adoption by the different stakeholders in SB.

AB As technology develops, there arises a need to take control of personal data. One of the most important benefits of block chain is that, it can store data permanently and in an immutable manner. And another one aspect is that block chain is decentralized i,e there is no central hub to store data. Using this technology to store important documents of an individual makes the documents more secured and they cannot be tampered once uploaded and the individual can have the advantage of accessing their documents anytime without the need of middle men. Smart contracts are used to exchange data in a transparent and in a trusted manner. Documents of the users are converted into e-docs along with a unique quick response code. Each individual's code forms a block with a specific hashed value and helps in forming a continuous blocks. These blocks cannot be altered once formed and hence it is not possible to retrieve the documents unless the user's permission. It is secured using the user's fingerprint which is dissolved into text using steganography. Thus the documents are kept secure and can be used whenever needed without any constraints and can also be never tampered or manipulated

AB The U.S. power grid is a complex system of systems that requires a trustworthy, reliable, and secure global supply chain. A formidable challenge considering the increasing number of networked industrial control systems (ICS) and energy delivery systems (EDS) and growing number of intermediary distributors, vendors and integrators involved. Grid modernization has increased the use of "smart" energy devices that automate, digitize, network, and bring together the cyber-physical energy supply chain. In the current Energy Internet of Things (EIoT) environment, the growth of data speed and size requirements as well as the number of critical cyber assets has generated new North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) compliance requirements and cyber supply chain security challenges for vendors, regulators, and utilities. The issuance of Order No. 829 by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) instructed the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to confront cybersecurity supply chain risk management for ICS software and hardware, as well as the networking and computing services associated with Bulk Electric System (BES) operations. To meet these goals, current technology and processes must be improved to better identify, monitor, and audit vulnerable EIoT environments. This paper examines how blockchain technology can enable NERC CIP compliance as well as aid in the security of the BES supply chain through an immutable cryptographically signed distributed ledger that allows for improved data security, provenance and auditability.

There are currently few studies on TSB, and to prevent their attacks in the future, we believe it is necessary to study them beforehand. This study constructs a relation graph of all the entities concerning TSB using identifiers in the Web. We introduce a systematic approach to finding relations among entities using a case study based on identifiers and clearness of relations. Our investigation covers data from both the Surface Web and Dark Web, with our Dark Web data consisting of over 40 million Dark Web webpages. We have uncovered many hacking forums, hacking groups, and individuals having a relation with TSB using our method. The relation graph of TSB will become a stepping stone in developing a knowledge base of TSB.

AB Blockchain is a distributed database that has advantage of being irreversible, transparent and decentralized. However, beside of its advantages, blockchain still face several challenges, one of them is scalability. One of the scalability challenges is increasing block size for every new transaction. The size of blockchain reached more than 180 GB. The block size will burden the node in conducting transaction verification. To overcome this problem, this paper has an objective to make summary blocks and compression for the summary blocks so that it can increase the space saving of blockchain and make it easier for nodes to verify transactions. The proposed method used for transactions whose entities can be transferred. This method combines block summarization algorithm and deflate compression algorithm. The proposed method applied to Bitcoin blockchain. Space saving is calculated by comparing the total size of original block with the total size of block that has been summarized and the total size of summary block which has been compressed. From the experiment results, the value of space saving for summary blocks is 22.318% and space saving for summary blocks that have been compressed is 78.104%.

AB In recent years, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies have attracted a great deal of attention from the whole industry including the financial as a new settlement system. Transaction information of these cryptocurrencies is stored in a distribution ledger called Blockchain on the P2P network through processing such as PoW. Meanwhile, since PoW requires a large amount of computer resources, researches on private / consortium type blockchain that do not need PoW. In this paper, we propose a decentralized netting protocol using a consortium type block chain that has the channel function. On a system that implements the proposed protocol, netting settlement can be performed on P2P hiding information of the sender and receiver name of transaction, amount of money, calculation butt of netting, and without setting up a specific central organization such as a central server.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency that aims to offer anonymity. However, anonymity is less secure than it is believed to be because it is based on using pseudonyms for addresses. To demonstrate this weakness, we used statistics related to transaction histories and the frequency of transactions to deanonymize a set of bitcoin addresses. In this paper, we explore the fundamental properties of Bitcoin addresses based on actual Bitcoin transaction data. We propose a new method for deanonymizing Bitcoin addresses from a set of output addresses and we demonstrate that 80.5% of addresses could be identified.

AB Bitcoin has utilized Proof-of-Work(PoW), which prevents double-spend attack in the distributed network. PoW is a consensus protocol that depends on a computing power, therefore it is highly difficult for malicious nodes to attack. However, emerging a group called mining pool encourage the centralization of computing power. This may make it easy to tamper with a distributed ledger called Blockchain of Bitcoin.
   In this paper, we propose the new protocol which evaluates computing power for each nodes and adjusts difficulty of generating a block based on the evaluation. This gives an equal opportunity for successful mining. Furthermore, reward for user's incentive is also adjusted based on the evaluation.

AB Since most of the organizations are going online these days, such organizations have become dependent to their data over the internet. Hence, it has become more critical to secure data by taking adequate security measures. One of the measures that can be taken to secure data from attackers and intruders is access control. Along with the changing trend, even the data used is evolving. 'Bitcoin' is the new data that has gained importance in the market. Every third person in the world has Bitcoin to their share. So it becomes important to secure Bitcoin and the information it possesses. Blockchain helps in preventing Bitcoin - the digital currency and therefore stores the information securely. In this paper, we survey and study how the rising of Blockchain technology has affected traditional transactional banking and also outline possible directions for future research.

AB Blockchain ushers in a new era for the global financial system with the advent of digital currency (cryptocurrency), and its impact can be felt in many related industries. Because of its possible applications, cryptocurrency draws significant attention from researchers. Although there are a number of risks (e.g., speculation, 51% attack) related to cryptocurrency, billions of dollars are invested in them, because of transparency, traceability, low transaction cost, and highly profitable potential. In December 2017, the most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, has reached almost $20,000.00 per coin. Such short-term, high gain potential attracts many new small investors. However, speculative movements raise many questions related to safety and privacy, just to name a few. In order to understand public opinion about cryptocurrency and to protect small investors financial interests, sentiment analysis can be done by using social media activities of individuals who are interested or investing in cryptocurrencies. One of the most important steps in the analysis is to understand the profiles of the users. Therefore, in this paper, we determine education levels of investors or users who are interested in eight cryptocurrencies by using seven readability techniques on Reddit comments as a part of profiling. Results show that the education levels of users are approximately 60% in middle school, 30% in high school, and 10% in other levels according to the average of the seven readability technique results. The results and analysis, which are provided in this paper, help new investors and developers to obtain profile information about the users who are interested or investing in cryptocurrency.

TI Ownership at stake (once again): housing, digital contents, animals and
   robots
SO JOURNAL OF PROPERTY PLANNING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW
AB Purpose - This paper aims to discuss the questioning around the current suitability of ownership both for accessing to certain property (housing, to be more specific) and chattels (digital contents, animals and autonomous robots) that have recently flourished, favored by technological advances and the change in the values of the millennials' in a context of crisis.
   Design/methodology/approach - The process of substitution (e.g. through alternative housing tenures, such as intermediate tenures and collaborative housing, licensing digital contents) or erosion/elimination (e.g. owning animals and robots, tokenization through blockchain) of ownership through key types of property and chattels.
   Findings - Ownership, both of land and goods, is again at the stake. Technological advances and/or new values of millennials in a context of crisis have led to questioning the suitability of ownership to favor universal access to housing, of holding music and other digital contents, have limited the faculties of animals' and pets' owners and are favoring the evolution of autonomous robots into subjects of law rather than mere objects.
   Research limitations/implications - Only key property (housing) and chattels are studied (digital contents, animals, robots). There is no broad study of the global current situation of ownership.
   Practical implications - It is discussed how the changes of values and technological advances in a context of crisis have impacted in the strength and reliability of ownership to allow access to property and chattels.
   Social implications - These changes in ownership change how we can access to property (housing) and to chattels (digital media) and even to changes in what is considered "object" such as what is happening in Europe with animals and robots.
   Originality/value - This is a new approach to consequences of the crisis in the field of housing (fractioning of ownership -temporal and shared ownership-, collaborative economy) and a change of values in the new millennial generation (animals) in this context and owing to the advance of the new technologies (robots). Is ownership again at the stake?

AB Railways around the world are moving towards digitalization to enhance their operations. The integration of railway data with other transport modes data becomes a vital part of the next generation of digital transport systems. One of the challenges for further digitization is data integration and security. This situation remains a challenge across organizations and industry boundaries. The blockchain is a new technology that might have the potential for acting as an enabler for the data integration and security challenge. In this paper a moderate literature review on the use of blockchain around different industries, in particular IoT applications, and in the railway context has been demonstrated. Opportunities and challenges that the blockchain technology can offer for the railway industry has been outlined.
   The paper has also looked at railway related blockchain current and potential applications. A simple analysis of the technology for the potential adoption rate has also been discussed. It was found that the blockchain can offer a number of benefits including added security and decentralization, however it will have a moderate technology adoption rate before it reaches it is transformative impact. In order to overcome some the adoption rate barriers in the railways, the author has developed a speech recognition and mobility based interface that can be utilized across different transport organizations, which can help in the data collection and pave the way for block chain applications. The solution was given the name of "inspectro".

AB Blockchain technology and its applications have played an important role to overcome challenges in numerous areas of the life. However, most current blockchain projects have concentrated on financial model by using existing platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum to generate tokens without the development of the technological features. Unfortunately, the decentralization has several challenges which cannot be adopted by our current political, economic and social systems. The fundamental technical problem of current blockchain algorithm is that 'performance inefficiency' could not be solved, in comparison with the central server system. In addition, the client software cannot establish conventions for making decisions about the future direction of the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, users' completed anonymity and the absence of a responsible person are also open problems of decentralization. To this end, this paper proposes an alternative method, dubbed RCANE which is semi centralized network of parallel blockchain and APoS (Authorized Proof of Stake), whose purpose is to solve the above challenges of current blockchain and comply with our preconceived perspectives of the current political, social, and economic systems to build up an ecosystem for economy, society and politics. Several experiments are conducted to show the executability of RCANE Project.

The PV connected to the DGR is controlled in both Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and Specified Power Point Tracking (SPPT) modes, depending on the electricity transactions that the DGR receives from the smart-contracts. The simulation results show that the PV under the proposed control algorithm generates the desired power almost exactly despite the varying irradiance.

AB In order to design a reliable and convenient tally method, the emergence of a tally system solves the problem of high database maintenance costs, such as management of the site factory, telecom, power companies, etc. The novel phases, constituted of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the block chain, extracts character characteristics through the VGG network training character classification model. The principal component analysis(PCA) algorithm accelerates feature comparison efficiency by reducing the dimensions of the feature matrix. In terms of data storage, the consistency of the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance(PBFT) algorithm ensures the accuracy of the data. The experiment demonstrates that practicability of the system can catch the requirements of the automatic bookkeeping method in the construction site.

AB The subject of this paper is to research the perception of customer satisfaction with bitcoin currency in the South astern Europe countries. The aim of this study is to identify the preferences of the people using bitcoin as the most famous and valuable cryptocurrency. This paper has particularly investigated the most important factors in choosing bitcoin. In addition to the survey, the least-squares criterion in the model of multiple linear regression was applied to determine the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were also used. It starts with the basic hypothesis that surveyed respondents would show a positive perception for using bitcoin currency in order to get much better satisfaction than by using traditional payment methods, given the very high costs of banking services in the observed countries due to a greater degree of security and privacy of payment transactions. Also, an auxiliary hypothesis has been defined, which reads: the establishment and faster expansion of bitcoin payments depends on the establishment of institutional infrastructure. The research conducted in the South Eastern Europe countries showed a high correlation between defined dependent variable and independent variable, i.e. a high degree of perception of meeting the needs and expectations of future users by considered bitcoin currency payment technology.

AB Swarm robotics is a research field in which a group of autonomous robots execute tasks through cooperative works. Sharing information among robots is a central function for an optimal performance of the system. Given that the swarm network structure constantly changes when robots move, it becomes difficult to guarantee on information sharing by all swarm members. We, in this work, propose an approach for information sharing on swarm robotic systems by using Blockchain technology. A function of distributed ledger in Blockchain technology has possibility to solve the information sharing problem and to easily synchronize their state. However, because Blockchain persistently keeps past transactions, the increase of its chain size is one of the serious issues to manage Blockchain technology. In this paper, we introduce a methodology to share information among autonomous robots and demonstrate through experiments that how the differences in data size recorded in the blockchain affect the chain size. As a result, compared with our previous approach, we succeeded in suppressing increase in chain size by using the proposal approach; it was reduced the amount of increase in chain size about 73.0% when each node repeatedly shared about 2.8KB image data by 100 times.

TI Online Media Coverage of BitCoin Crypto-currency in Nigeria: A study of
   Selected Online Version of Leading Mainstream Newspapers in Nigeria
SO H-ERMES-JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB Given the economic hardship in Nigeria in the past few years, Nigerians resorted to finding alternative ways as a survival strategy. Bit-coin and a good number of other crypto currencies formed the long sought economic alternative to such extent that it is gradually getting public acceptance as a means of transaction. Subsequent upon the collapse of MMM, the Nigerian government dismissed the use of crypto as legal means of exchange in Nigeria. This brought about reaction from bit-coin participants, experts and government officials. This study therefore is an examination of online media coverage aimed at ascertaining the slant of coverage, the dominant media source and type and how detailed the reports issued in the media concerning Bit-coin are. The researcher used the qualitative and quantitative content analysis research method to examine the manifest contents of the selected online media while framing and social responsibility theory formed the benchmark for the study. The study spanned for three months covering December 2017 through February 2018. Findings revealed that Nigerian online media gave negative slant to their coverage of Bit-coin crypto currency. It was also found that while government source dominates news source, straight news reports dominated the types of media used in the coverage of Bit-coin crypto-currency. The researcher concluded that the media had played their social responsibility role to the public by providing detailed reports on bit-coin and recommended that the mainstream media should also join hands in delivering detailed messages on salient issues.

As blockchains are append-only we present a way to help reduce the chain size and growth for Ethereum. Contract creation transaction data is replaced with hashes which identify a file in InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). Doing so reduces the size of data stored in such transactions by 93.86% in our dataset.

AB In the frame of smart city initiatives, map-based web applications (WebGIS) are distinguished by the complexity of client-side implementation and high load on web servers. Web-map applications provide non-typical web content usually visualized by JavaScript code. For such applications, higher-level advanced approaches to quality of service (QoS) assessment are required. In this paper, a method based on the estimation of users' interest in a web page and the information quantity provided by a web page is introduced. In order to implement it, a proof of work (PoW) concept is applied for verification of real users. Moreover, a novel metric is introduced to calculate the information quantity provided by web pages. PoW is used for verification of real users and distinguishing them from bots. Additionally, it can be utilized for balancing of web server load. For monitoring of web pages, an image-based approach is introduced. Web pages are rendered into raster images. A number of metrics describing an image are calculated. This approach allows users to compare and track various web pages, including rich web applications providing complex WebGL content. Several web services utilize the developed solutions. Analysis of harvested data proves the effectiveness of the proposed solution.

AB Recently, many different electronic digital currencies have appeared on a daily basis, the reason for this is a great success and the boom brought by the currency of Bitcoin at the level of the Internet. In general, creating a new electronic digital currency such as Bitcoin is not easy but at the same time not impossible, the basic idea is to create a new electronic digital currency in its unique work, but how does it work? In the digital Internet currencies system, the delaying on transaction verifying is preventing these currencies from getting increase popularity these days and makes the system vulnerable to attack attempts. In this work, we introduce a proximity awareness extending for the digital currency Bitcoin procedure, a noun as Bitcoins Cluster-Based Pinging Timing procedure (BCBPT). An entire objective of this suggested procedure built on in what way the clusters subedit and the nodes acquaint their affiliation is to ameliorate the transacting propagating retard in the Bitcoin networking. In the BCBPT, the closeness of connecthity in a Bitcoin networking is increasing by gathering Bitcoin nodes built on ping the latency among this nodes. It presents, over simulating which the closeness base ping latencies determine best cluster frameworks which optimizing the performing of the transacting propagating lateness. The lessening of the communicating linking estimate measured via the information propagation period between the nodes fundament ally considered as a critical cause for this improvement. The BCBPT procedure is most efficacious at decrease the transacting propagating lateness.

AB With the Internet of Things (IoT) evolving more and more, companies active within this area face new challenges for their Identity and Access Management (IAM). Namely, general security, resource constraint devices, interoperability, and scalability cannot be addressed anymore with traditional measures. Blockchain technology, however, may act as an enabler to overcome those challenges. In this paper, general application areas for blockchain in IAM are described based on recent research work. On this basis, it is discussed how blockchain can address IAM challenges presented by IoT. Finally, a corporate scenario utilizing blockchain-based IAM for IoT is outlined to assess the applicability in practice. The paper shows that private blockchains can be leveraged to design tamper-proof IAM functionality while maintaining scalability regarding the number of clients and transactions. This could be useful for enterprises to prevent single-point-of-failures as well as to enable transparent and secure auditing & monitoring of security-relevant events.

AB With Bitcoin, the legitimacy of a block of transaction data is verified by randomly selected nodes (hereinafter, verifiers) and notified to all nodes. To ensure the random selection of the verifier of each block, Proof of Works (PoW) is used. However, there is a serious problem with PoW, in that the amount of computation becomes huge. Although Proof of Stake (PoS) has been proposed to reduce the amount of computation, there remains the problem that if there is collusion among nodes, it is possible to control the probability of being the verifier. In this paper, a novel technique, Proof-of-Lucky-ID (PoL), is proposed. PoL is a kind of lottery that guarantees the randomness of the selection of the verifier, even if the node is collaborating unfairly, by using multiple digital signatures created by other nodes as input. Since this technique can determine the verifier with about two hash calculations per node, it significantly reduces the amount of processing compared with PoW, which requires more than 10(boolean AND)19 hash calculations as of 2017. In addition, since the input value cannot be controlled even if there is node collusion, it is impossible to control the probability of a win. Furthermore, compared to PoW and PoS, the certainty of consensus can be estimated with high accuracy in a short time. Numerical calculations show that both the randomness of verifier selection by the proposed method and the accuracy of the certainty of consensus range estimation are sufficiently high.

AB Given a graph, the notion of entropic centrality was introduced by Tutzauer to characterize vertices which are important in the sense that there is a high uncertainty about the destination of an atomic flow starting at them, assuming that at each hop, the flow is equally likely to continue to any unvisited vertex, or to be terminated there. We generalize this notion of entropic centrality to non- atomic flows, and furthermore show that the case of a non- atomic flow splitting with equal probability across different subsets of edges results in the same entropic centrality as that of the atomic flow. This gives a new and more generalized interpretation to the original entropic centrality notion. Finally, we demonstrate using network graphs derived from Bitcoin transactions that depending on the graph characteristics, the presented entropy based centrality metric can provide a unique perspective not captured by other existing centrality measures - particularly in identifying vertices with relatively low out-degrees which may nevertheless be connected to hub vertices, and thus can have high spread in the network.

AB In this paper will be presented new opportunities for developing innovative solutions based on blockchain technologies in creation of new data management algorithms, especially those focused on the distribution and processing of data in layered structures, where independent instances can fully control and verify all operations. Later an attempt will be made to generalize protocols, which will be proposed for management activities, towards their extension and the possibility of using them in hierarchical structures. Blockchain technology should enable the development of decentralized management protocols that will allow complete verifiability of all operations by all authorized parties that can collect, process and transmit such information. In practice such protocols will give the opportunity to create an effective and secure data sharing protocols in structures, where all authorized entities are equal and can independently verify the type of operations and instances that process such data.

AB In this paper, we propose a partitioned BlockChain based Framework for Auto-insurance Claims and Adjudication (B-FICA) for CAVs that tracks both sensor data and entity interactions with two-sided verification. B-FICA uses permissioned BC with two partitions to share information on a need to know basis. It also uses multi-signed transactions for proof of execution of instructions, for reliability and auditability and also uses a dynamic lightweight consensus and validation protocol to prevent evidence alteration. Qualitative evaluation shows that B-FICA is resilient to several security attacks from potential liable entities. Finally, simulations show that compared to the state of the art, BFICA reduces processing time and its delay overhead is negligible for practical scenarios and at marginal security cost.

AB With the inclusion of network interfaces always connected to embedded systems, the concept of Internet of Things emerges. Today, IoT devices are in virtually all human activities facilitating the quality of life of people. Despite the advantages of these devices, there are also some drawbacks, one of the main ones being cyber security. One of the technologies currently in vogue to mitigate cyber security problems is blockchain. The overall blockchain approach is to be implemented on the server side, where computing capabilities are not as limited as in embedded systems. This paper proposes a methodology to assess the blockchain technologies. To evaluate the proposed methodology a comparative study of various blockchain technologies that can be implemented in embedded systems particularly for use in smart meters with SBC Raspberry Pi has been conducted. The results show that lightweight implementations of Blockchains are better for embedded systems.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices proliferation is on the rise, where the number of connected devices has surpassed 7 billion devices in 2017, whereas insights foresee a number of 20-50 billion connections by year 2020. Most of those devices are deployed in heterogeneous and complex networks which imposes many challenges on the devices management functionality. Among those challenges is the identity management which pertains to how devices' identities are authenticated and verified in addition to how devices establish the means for authorizing and controlling access to data and services. Blockchain as a distributed ledger technology positions itself as a suitable candidate to address this challenge. That is mainly attributed to Blockchain's use of cryptographic identifiers, records immutability, and provenance. These features, together, provide a platform to implement the functions of IoT devices identity management that can ensure a global and unique identity for the devices, and also provide the mechanism to maintain it throughout the device life cycle. This paper presents a semi-decentralized Blockchain-based IoT identity management framework that provides features of identity creation and transfer of ownership, along with the capability of identity portability among networks visited by the devices. For validation, we describe a set of smart contracts that provide the functions of the registrar and management contracts.

TI Decentralising Virtual Reality
SO ELEKTROTEHNISKI VESTNIK-ELECTROCHEMICAL REVIEW
AB Socialising in virtual reality environments is becoming increasingly popular. Research outlines the possibility of using the blockchain technology in order to create a peer-to-peer network for the virtual reality environment. By doing so, this paper considers the possibilities of decentralising the virtual reality space which was previously accessed through centralised platforms. There is a growing support for the claim that participation between peers is higher on a decentralised virtual reality platform compared to participation on a centralised platform. This study draws on ethnographic research of a digital community formed around a decentralised virtual reality platform and observes their group activities and engagements. The paper finds that individuals tend to show a high activity when it comes to co-designing virtual worlds and puts forward three concepts to discuss positive and negative angles of the decentralised virtual reality, i.e. co-creation of the content, visuals and governance. This implication is supported by an observation that users of the decentralised virtual reality platform co-build virtual ecosystems without a centralised authority.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCY FROM A SHARII'AH PERSPECTIVE
SO AL-SHAJARAH
AB For the past few years there has been a significant increase of people's interest in crypto-currencies. Seminars and conferences have been organized to discuss the nature and feasibility of cryptocurrencies. Some argue that it is good to have an alternative to the current fiat money system in which the predominant role is played by banks, while a cryptocurrency does not require any bank account, tax payment and auditing. Some others disagree with these arguments and claim that any mode of payment in other than traditionally known instruments such as cash payment, telegraphic-transfers, cheques and so, will open the door to avoid tax and audits, which in turn may seriously effect a government's budget and may even decrease GDP. This research uses theoretical, descriptive and analytical methods of research and therefore focuses on the following important points: a) defining the place of cryptocurrency in the financial system by determining the extent of its influence; b) reviewing the literature on the topic, which will allow us to determine the current understanding of the problem by modern science; c) unveiling the key requirements of Shari'ah for money and money circulation to formulate a standard understanding of money in Shari'ah; d) comparing the characteristics of paper money and crypto-currencies (using the bitcoins as an example). The authors believe in permissibility of using the cryptocurrencies but with strict reservations.

AB The use of distributed ledger technologies introduces new security and privacy challenges. These challenges are dependent on properties of the ledgers, such as transaction latency and throughput. Some use cases may be outright impossible to implement securely, or in a privacy-retaining manner. Consequently, it is important that these concerns are taken into account when distributed ledger technologies are evaluated and selected as building blocks for higher-level systems. In this paper, we illustrate these concerns through use case examples. We discuss the implications these concerns on the use of distributed ledgers within higher-level systems, such as in SOFIE, a DLT-based approach to securely and openly federate IoT systems.

AB GDPR abiding blockchain systems are feasible. Jurists, programmers, and other experts are increasingly working on this aim nowadays. Still, manifold blockchain networks functioning out there suggest a new generation of data protection issues brought about by this technology. Some of these issues will likely concern the right to erasure set up by Art. 17 of the EU data protection regulation ('GDPR'). These cases will soon be discussed before national authorities and courts, and will likely test the technical solutions explored in this paper, such as hashing out methods, keys destruction, chameleon hash functions, and more. By taking into account matters of design and the complex architecture of blockchains, we shall distinguish between blockchains that have been thought about to expressly meet the requirements of the EU regulation, and blockchains that, for one reason or another, e.g. ante GDPR designed blockchains, trigger some sort of clash with the legal order, that is, (i) matters of principle on e.g. political decentralization; (ii) standards on security and data protection; (iii) a mix of them; and, (iv) social clash. It is still unclear how the interplay of legal regulation, technological constraints, social norms, and market interests, will end up in this context. Rulings and court orders will be instructive. It is a clash foretold, after all.

Interdomain routing security is of vital importance to the Internet since it prevents unwanted traffic redirections. IPchain makes use of blockchains' properties to provide flexible trust models and simplified management when compared to existing systems. In this paper we argue that Proof of Stake is a suitable consensus algorithm for IPchain due to the unique incentive structure of this use-case. We have implemented and evaluated IPchain's performance and scalability storing around 150k IP prefixes in a 1GB chain.

AB The recent success of electric vehicles leads to unprecedentedly high peaks of demand on the electric grid at the times when most people charge their cars. In order to avoid unreasonably rising costs due to inefficient utilization of the electricity infrastructure, we propose EVA: a scheduling system to solve the valley filling problem by distributing the electricity demand generated by electric vehicles in a geographically limited area efficiently over time spans in which the electric grid is underutilized. EVA is based on a smart contract running on the Ethereum blockchain in combination with off-chain computational nodes performing the schedule calculation using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This allows for a high degree of transparency and verifiability in the scheduling computation results while maintaining a reasonable level of efficiency. In order to interact with the scheduling system, we developed a decentralized app with a graphical frontend, where the user can enter vehicle information and future energy requirements as well as review upcoming schedules. The calculation of the schedule is performed on a daily basis, continuously providing schedules for participating users for the following day.

AB Distributed ledger technologies, such as blockchain systems, have in recent years emerged as promising platforms for machine-to-machine commerce and other forms of multi-stakeholder applications. However, despite the potential demonstrated by projects such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger Fabric, the disk space typically required to host a copy of a ledger may be prohibitively large for many categories of devices. In this paper, we introduce an approach for reducing ledger size in blockchain systems, based on arbitrary pruning predicate functions, allowing each network participant to independently select and remove any already applied transactions. We also show that if only pruning certain ledger transactions, the ability to derive an unmodified state data structure from the remaining transactions is maintained. The approach is validated through a supply chain use case utilizing a modified version of Hyperledger Fabric, in which ledger size is reduced by about 84.49% via selective transaction pruning.

AB Among the various challenges faced by the P2P file sharing systems like BitTorrent, the most common attack on the basic foundation of such systems is: Free-riding. Generally, free-riders are the users in the file sharing network who avoid contributing any resources but tend to consume the resources unethically from the P2P network whereas white-washers are more specific category of free-riders that voluntarily leave the system in a frequent fashion and appearing again and again with different identities to escape from the penal actions imposed by the network. BitTorrent being a collaborative distributed platform requires techniques for discouraging and punishing such user behavior. In this paper, we propose that "Instead of punishing, we may focus more on rewarding the honest peers". This approach could be presented as an alternative to other mechanisms of rewarding the peers like tit-for-tat [10], reciprocity based etc., built for the BitTorrent platform. The prime objective of BitTrusty is: providing incentives to the cooperative peers by rewarding in terms of cryptocoins based on blockchain. We have anticipated three ways of achieving the above defined objective. We are further investigating on how to integrate these two technologies of distributed systems viz. P2P file sharing systems and blockchain, and with this new paradigm, interesting research areas can be further developed, both in the field of P2P cryptocurrency networks and also when these networks are combined with other distributed scenarios.

TI A Secure Incentive Scheme for Vehicular Delay Tolerant Networks Using
   Cryptocurrency
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB One remarkable feature of vehicular ad hoc networks is characterized by an opportunistic communications by means of store-carry-forward message relaying which requires the cooperation of vehicles on the networks. However, we cannot be sure that all vehicles willingly contribute their computing resources to the networks for message forwarding with no rewards for their efforts in real-world scenarios. In addition, unfortunately, there may exist some selfish and greedy node which may not help others but tend to take their own gain. To cope with this challenge, incentive mechanisms are generally considered as the promising solution. In this paper, we design a Bitcoin-based secure and reliable incentive scheme for cooperative vehicular delay tolerant networking services. Bitcoin is the well-known worldwide cryptocurrency and digital payment system whose implementation relies on cryptographic techniques, which makes it possible to develop a practical credit-based incentive scheme on the vehicular networks at a low cost. We also implement Bitcoin transaction scripts to handle our proposed incentive scheme.

AB Standard security protocols are heavy weight in terms of memory foot prints which make all the security protocol unfit for budgeted platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). The blockchain (BC) is a very efficient architecture to preserve five basic cryptographic primitives, such as authenticity, integrity, confidentiality, availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of blockchain in IoT causes significant energy consumption, delay, and computational overhead which are not suitable for various resource-constrained IoT devices. In our submission we change the basic architecture of blockchain and make it more efficient for IoT application. The article proposes an IoT based smart city architecture which adopted the blockchain technology preserving all the cryptographic security issues. The adoption of blockchain causes very minimal overhead on IoT platform. Comparison of all security parameters with existing literature shows that the architecture is reasonably efficient in terms of security.

AB Global payment systems powered by blockchain technology through various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethreum are growing rapidly providing public access to its database. The technology eliminates the need for a central authority like bank to control the data. Instead, verification and integrity of data are provided through cryptographic techniques. Bitcoin is not a monetary generated by a government. Analyzing the public dataset and exploring its statistical property can uncover some hidden facts in cryptocurrency and the blockchain protocol. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey. First is to provide an up-to-date literature survey on Bitcoin transaction analysis, and second is to understand the hidden facts that could be revealed by analyzing Bitcoin transactions. To provide a comprehensive survey, we categorize existing analysis based on anonymity, user behavior, wealth accumulation and currency rate prediction. Analyzing the Bitcoin transactions can help to understand it from a broader perspective that can help investors in decision making.

TI Monetary Relations as Object of Criminal Law Protection: History and
   Modernity
SO PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI
AB At the present level of development of the state and society, any relations regulated by law are a component of the system, which is either integral or seeks to become such. Equally, this thesis can be extended to monetary relations, presenting them as a special system. Structural elements of such a system are banknotes, their various denominations, procedures of their issuance, and organization of their circulation. However, this system and its proper functioning are framed by the law that describes the system itself and regulates social relations within it, which was highlighted in the last anniversary report of the Club of Rome. This is one of the philosophical mistakes that goes back to the idea of Adam Smith that the boundaries of the market, law and morality coincide, and that law and values represent only the background of these processes. Meanwhile, recent research in this area shows that an economic system's functioning is limited by more fundamental rules - i.e., by law and morality. The monetary system plays no less of an important role in this regard, as it is an essential component of the state in view of the interrelationship and interdependence of a country's national security and its social and economic development. But, like any other relations regulated by law, monetary relations within the framework of this system are subject to protection by the state in order to maintain a fluid balance (harmony); and the effectiveness of a national monetary mechanism, for which the legislative framework provides a wide array of measures, including criminal law. The subject of research is the system of monetary relations as an object of criminal legal protection. The purpose of this analysis is to discover what criminal legal mechanisms have been used to protect the domestic currency market in the past, and what issues the monetary system is facing today. The article is prepared on the basis of a legal and technical analysis of legal norms, as well as comparative legal and formal logical methods; i.e., the method of systemic analysis. According to the author, a historical analysis of the issue as framed will positively affect the development of a qualitative approach to resolving modern issues. The conclusion is that financial security must comply with a tangible development of monetary relations and be adapted to modern conditions, including those of criminal justice.

AB While the multiple party computation (MPC) has been suggested for over two decades, we still have not witnessed implementations that make MPC or its derivates deployed in a palpable reality. Difficulties stem from serial security and trust issues, typically expressed in data leakage, lazy calculation, and deny of payment etc. Many solutions rely on a third party to organize parties co-working, however, this requires each participant to totally trust the third party and delegate the source data and payment to it. In this paper, we suggest a protocol under blockchain structure to achieve efficient MPC without a trusted third party. The cooperation and schedule tasks are executed by a zero-knowledge coordinator, while the smart contracts is used to handle user request and safe payment. Cryptography techniques are adopted to ensure confidentiality, privacy-preserving and verifiability. All the data are transferred and calculated in the cipher state, and only the payed user can decrypt for the calculation result.

AB Blockchain is one of the most hyped technologies of recent years. It promises to restructure the way applications are developed and to replace the widely client-server model used today. While the technology is promising the ecosystem of tools and development methodologies are still in their early stages. In this paper a proof of concept blockchain application is developed, regarding the exchange of data between different universities in different countries, with respect to the Erasmus program. A decentralized application has been designed from ground up and is proposed to be installed in multiple nodes located in all participating universities. Ethereum platform has been chosen and the required smart contracts have been implemented. Additionally an easy to use web interface have been developed in order to be usable for end users. We have evaluated both the development process and the efficiency of the resulting implementation.

AB The concept of a decentralized ledger usually implies that each node of a blockchain network stores the entire blockchain. However, in the case of popular blockchains, which each weigh several hundreds of GB, the large amount of data to be stored can incite new or low-capacity nodes to run lightweight clients. Such nodes do not participate to the global storage effort and can result in a centralization of the blockchain by very few nodes, which is contrary to the basic concepts of a blockchain.
   To avoid this problem, we propose new low storage nodes that store a reduced amount of data generated from the blockchain by using erasure codes. The properties of this technique ensure that any block of the chain can be easily rebuilt from a small number of such nodes. This system should encourage low storage nodes to contribute to the storage of the blockchain and to maintain decentralization despite of a globally increasing size of the blockchain. This system paves the way to new types of blockchains which would only be managed by low capacity nodes.

AB End-to-end verifiable (E2E) voting systems attempt to establish elections where each voter receives direct assurance that their vote was cast correctly, and anyone may determine that each ballot was correctly included in the overall tally of the vote. One such E2E implementation, Helios, achieves this "open audit" functionality by making public the auditing algorithm and each encrypted vote, along with their encryption proofs, on a public bulletin board. Unfortunately, hosting the bulletin board on a centralized server puts this functionality at risk of denial of service or data tampering, each of which could degrade the public's trust of the election results. To mitigate these risks, this paper demonstrates the replacement of the bulletin board concept with decentralized storage and a blockchain. In doing so, the election audit data benefit from a system where such data becomes immutable, and where the data is replicated and publicly accessible. This architecture allows the encrypted votes, their proofs, and the election audit algorithm to be hosted independent of the election services, eliminating the risk of tampering or denial of service while still maintaining voter verifiability.

Although Food/Nutrition sector, and related communities are dispersed in many ways: geography, traditions, living standard, ideology, taste preferences, etc., eating is one of the most universal activities. Global challenges are pointing at Mega-trends which are opening opportunities for decentralized collaboration along the whole Food/Nutrition value chain. LSBC is looking to transfer its experience with Collaboration on a micro level (use case of community building of local small food producers) to decentralized communities on a large scale. LSBC is exploring community building fostering mechanisms, based on Blockchain technology, by applying principles of AI networks, such as self-regulation, self-learning, and developing concept such as stimulating connecting activity of agents/nodes. The main goal of this research is to establish principles of effective information exchange that will enable the creation of communication tools for optimizing connectivity of decentralized communities.

AB We experience an ever-larger gap between existing knowledge in the public policy of international trade and security or factors of economic growth and political discourse in the US, Europe, and elsewhere alike. Extremist xenophobia is on the rise. In contrast, we propose an optimistic analysis for the future. It is flows and trends that characterize flows.
   Born in advanced thermodynamics, the constructal theory of design and evolution in nature proposes that 'for a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it.' Papers [1-2] demonstrate that constuctal law applies to both inanimate systems with flow (rivers basins, turbulent flow, self-lubrication) and animate systems with flow (lungs, cardio-vascular system, animal locomotion). Constructal law also applies to man made systems ([3-5]). Social, political, or economic systems (financial and monetary system, trade and exchanges of raw materials, industrial products and services), intangible capital flows globally (knowledge, human capital, market capital, and process capital, including cyber-attacks), are all governed by the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. We propose a research agenda to verify how constructal law predicts global policy making. Evolution of monetary system from barter exchanges to rise of virtual currencies, rise of cyber attacks, and latest with bitcoin, all fit constructal law.

AB The Bitcoin network is a complex network that records anonymous financial transactions while encapsulating the relationships among its pseudonymous users. This paper proposes graph mining techniques to explore the relationships among wallet addresses (pseudonyms for Bitcoin users) suspected to be involved in a given extortion racket, exploiting the anonymity of the Bitcoin network to collect and launder money. Starting around Bitcoin addresses of potential interest, neighborhood subgraphs are analyzed in terms of path length and confluence to detect suspicious Bitcoin flow and other wallet addresses controlled by the suspected perpetrators. We show with a dataset of the Ashley Madison blackmail campaign from August 2015 how the mechanisms can be used both to estimate the amount of money that was extorted by the suspected perpetrators under the specific blackmail campaign, and also estimate the amount of money handled by them during the same period of time.

AB Cryptocurrencies have recently gained huge popularity. It is desirable to come up with effective approaches to constructing better blockchain protocols. In this paper, inspired by the 2-hop design by Duong et al (ePrint 2016/716), we put forth a generic paradigm for blockchain design, called n-hop blockchain. It includes one main chain, which is supported by (n - 1) supporting chains; hence, the main chain can achieve better security performance. In our paradigm, we show that our n-hop design can be easily extended to (n + 1)-hop design. To demonstrate the power of our paradigm, we showcase two instantiations: 2-hop blockchain variant, a combination of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work, and 3-hop blockchain variant, which is extended from 2-hop blockchain variant by adding Byzantine fault tolerance blockchain in 3rd hop.

AB The design of a successful distributed system for enabling payments and small transactions among Internet users has long been a major challenge in applied computer science. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency having reached world-wide popularity, suffers from sustainability problems such as inefficient energy expenditure for its network operation and from perverse incentives that foster speculative hoarding behavior. We propose a digital transfer system based on a variant of the Bitcoin ledger that is meant to support deterministic small payments with enforced proportional transaction fees: to achieve this property, we renounce the persistence of balances expected of a cryptocurrency, thus mitigating currency hoarding. We introduce at the same time a novel external incentive mechanism based on a verifiable third party with the goal of promoting long-term sustainability, adjusting the margins of profitability for contributors to the proof-of-work scheme without stifling the transaction rate.

AB The places where people routinely gather to interact and work can be thought of as territories with boundaries that provide a smart context to achieve personal and professional goals. For example, the Venice Gateway for Science and Technology of VEGA(ST) is such a smart context, in the form of a co-working space. In this paper, smart contexts are explored using the integrated framework of Service Science, Management Engineering, Design Arts Public Policy (SSME +DAPP) and the Viable Systems Approach (VSA) research methods, which encourage the development of T-shaped professionals with depth and breadth. We explore the importance of: (1) adopting a win-win logic between the external environment and the resource holders of the wider enterprise-territory system, (2) the creation of smart contexts, as a symbol of sharing, where interaction and actor involvement facilitate the co-creation of value for the collective welfare, and (3) co-working spaces as a way to encourage T-shape professionals to develop their broad dynamic capabilities and their in depth competencies.

AB Enterprise Architecture (EA) represents both business and Information Technology (IT) perspectives, which must be constantly updated in response to the transformations of the company; this update is difficult to achieve. The problem has been addressed on different fronts and there are still ways to explore, one of them is the blockchain technology, especially the way to extend the logic of smart contracts to the company. In this study the authors propose to implement a new type of operational processes activity through smart contracts, which could detect that, the process in which they are operating, has an unexpected behavior and, in turn, warn of possible needs to update the AE and the same smart contract.

AB Over the last decade, the increasing uptake of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) at the grid edge transforms residential houses into complex energy "prosumers". A house with rooftop solar PV can both consume and export electricity. Hence, it can participate in a "Transactive Energy" network involving peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange of excess electricity. The challenge is to keep track of these transactions and compensate buyers and sellers accordingly. Recently, blockchain has emerged as a distributed ledger technology which allows exchanges among participants without the need for a central market entity. There are several blockchain pilots in the energy sector, which focus on the business, legal and financial aspects, but without much details about how to implement a blockchain-based P2P trading platform. This paper addresses this issue by presenting laboratory-scale implementation of a blockchain network for exchange of solar electricity among participants using Hyperledger - an open-source collaborative effort. Participants, assets and transactions necessary to establish the blockchain-based network for keeping track of solar PV output exchanges are described, together with the smart contract, use cases and their implementation.

AB In order for malicious software to receive configuration information or commands, malware needs to be able to locate and connect to its owner. As hard-coded addresses are easy to block and thus render the malware installation inoperable, malware writers have turned to dynamically generated addresses. Domain generation algorithms (DGA) generate a list of candidate domain names, each valid for only a short time, at which the malware installation searches for its command & control (C&C) server. As DGAs generate a large list of potential domains - out of which one or a few is actually in use -, they leave a characteristic trace of many failed DNS lookups (NXDomain) in the network, and in result most DGAs can be efficiently detected.
   In this paper we describe an entirely new principle of domain generation, actively deployed in the Cerber ransomware, which finds and coordinates with its owner based on transaction information in the bitcoin blockchain. This allows the malware author to dynamically update the location of the server in realtime, and as the malware directly goes to the right location no longer generates a sequence of NXDomain responses. We describe the concept of coordination via the blockchain, and report results on a year-long observation of the assets used in the Cerber campaign.

AB The optimizing and increasing the efficiency of human resource management in a knowledge-based economy becomes the central issue for research in the field of training and professional integration of high-qualified specialists. The description of competencies and skills required by companies as well as the personal features of candidates, their motivations and interests presented through human resources portfolio and cv need high level of security requirements and agile decentralized methods of governance. Blockchain technologies are able to allow the necessary level of data security and to minimize costs, for this purpose blockchain platform is seen in this paper as a pertinent basis to build a global register of qualification certificates and competency assessment. Developing such a ledger requires coordinating assessments of competencies and qualifications at the global level of business processes, which can be carried out by regulators, for example, government institutions, and on the basis of decentralizing corporate and individual requests, goals and self-actualization motives, which seems more appropriate to the actual practice of creating infrastructure.

By taking advantage of the repetition of sections of bytecode among multiple smart contracts previously deployed in the Ethereum blockchain we propose a new pseudo opcode that acts as a pointer that will allow smart contracts to reuse previously deployed code.
   We show that our proposed algorithm achieves space savings of up to 75% in a dataset of deployed Ethereum smart contracts bytecode, on par with other state of the art compression algorithms while remaining compatible with other methods currently in use for space reduction.

AB Proposed is a communication system, integrating a distributed ledger with ambient intelligence and a data fusion scheme. It introduces a clear distinction between the financial profitability of investment projects and their contribution to environmental sustainability while ensuring performance measurability and flexibility for both aspects of project management as well as the possibility to trade emission certificates. Two key benefits of the system are the possibility to implement a reliable and straightforward methodology for the evaluation of investments, both ongoing and planned, and the potential to connect the emissions trading scheme with pollution control in the real time. Moreover, the system brings about stability where the revisions of governmental subsidy policies tend to move the break-even costs significantly, thus incentivising for innovative or small-scale projects.

AB Sand is a key ingredient for many industries, including concrete, glass, and electronics. Sand extraction is now exceeding fossil fuels and biomass. The absence of data on aggregates sand mining makes assessments difficult and has contributed to the lack of awareness about this issue. A sand governance business framework is developed applying the blockchain technology as the main goal of this study to regulate the sand extraction and trade. Blockchain technology provides a distributed concurrency monitoring system for the supply management. Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) as an effective bottom-up tool is applied to demonstrate the application of the model. The sand providers and users are modeled as a collection of autonomous decision-making entities called agents. The agents interact with each other, the regulators participate in making decisions on the basis of a set of rules that are defined within the blockchain network.

AB During the normal operation of a Cloud solution, no one usually pays attention to the logs except technical department, which may periodically check them to ensure that the performance of the platform conforms to the Service Level Agreements. However, the moment the status of a component changes from acceptable to unacceptable, or a customer complains about accessibility or performance of a platform, the importance of logs increases significantly. Depending on the scope of the issue, all departments, including management, customer support, and even the actual customer, may turn to logs to find out what has happened, how it has happened, and who is responsible for the issue. The party at fault may be motivated to tamper the logs to hide their fault. Given the number of logs that are generated by the Cloud solutions, there are many tampering possibilities. While tamper detection solution can be used to detect any changes in the logs, we argue that critical nature of logs calls for immutability. In this work, we propose a blockchain-based log system, called Logchain, that collects the logs from different providers and avoids log tampering by sealing the logs cryptographically and adding them to a hierarchical ledger, hence, providing an immutable platform for log storage.

AB Blockchain technology has gained immense popularity because many researchers believe that it could solve numerous problems and could be applied in various fields of study. Unfortunately, behind its potentials, blockchain also possessed many challenges and limitations. The highlighted problem is the usability aspect of blockchain technology examined from developer and user perspective. This paper tried to address this problem by proposing query functionalities, with the help of query layer system, to facilitate the developer and the user to access blockchain data easily. There are three main query functionalities that will be discussed in this paper: (1) finding blockchain data based on multiple search parameters (retrieval query), (2) providing simple statistical analysis from a collection of blockchain data (aggregate query) and (3) sorting blockchain data according to its blockchain component (ranking query). For the implementation stage, Ethereum is used as platform to provide blockchain network, MongoDB is used as cloud storage service and REST API is used as web services. For the testing stage, throughput and time response are used to evaluate the performance of the developed query functionalities in the query layer system. The results are: (1) the throughput of query layer system is lower than Ethereum service for blockchain data retrieval and (2) the time response of query layer system is affected by the number of thread and the amount of data stored in cloud storage.

AB This paper addresses the problem of uploading large quantities of sensitive industrial data to a public distributed network by proposing a new framework. The framework combines the existing technologies of the distributed web and distributed ledger to provide a mechanism of encrypting data and choosing whom to share the data with. The framework is designed to work with existing platforms; the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and the Ethereum blockchain platforms are used as examples within this paper, though it is stated that similar platforms are capable of providing the requirements for the framework to operate. The framework uses the concept of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (DHKE), and is implemented in three different mechanisms of the DHKE: one-step Elliptical Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (ECDH); two-step ECDH; and Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (SIDH). The paper discusses the security of each along with individual advantages and disadvantages, and concludes that the SIDH is the most appropriate implementation for future use due to it being post-quantum secure.

AB Cryptocurrency exchange platforms, which have appeared recently, provide exchanges between different types of cryptocurrencies as well as fiat money. Since multiple exchange platforms exist today, it is of essential importance to have timely information about user experience and the behavior of participants in such platforms. Trust is a notion that has been studied extensively in sociology, psychology, economics and compuer science, with an objective to provide measures for quantifying user behavior in specific social settings and contexts. While in the domain of online social networks, the trust has been thoroughly analyzed from various points of view, in cryptocurrency exchange platforms, the questions about quantifying the levels of emerging trust, are still open. In this work, we elaborate on quantifying trust in the context of cryptocurrency exchange platforms. We focus on two well known bitcoin exchange platforms: BitcoinOTC and Bitcoin-Alpha. Using the existing data about user ratings upon interactions in these two platforms, we show how trust is related with the network structure and how to identify communities where trust level is high among participants. Our results can serve as a basis for a strategy on how to interact within these platforms.

AB Modern electronic healthcare (e-health) settings constitute collaborative environments requiring sophisticated fine-grained access control mechanisms to cater their access demands. Access delegatability is quite crucial to realize fine-grained, flexible access control schemes compatible with such environments. In this paper, we addressed this issue through proposing an attribute based access control scheme integrated with controlled access delegation capabilities suitable for a multi-domain e-health environment. We have utilized the blockchain technology to manage attribute assignments, delegations as well as revocations. The scheme enables delegations in a controlled manner without jeopardizing the security of the system. The control is achieved via granting each delegating user the capability of controlling the subsequent delegations made by the delegatee as well as limiting the length of a chain of delegations. Furthermore, it is equipped with a superior attribute revocation mechanism and induces substantially lower key management overhead to the end-users in comparison to the existing access control schemes with delegatability.

TI Blockchain Support in IoT Platforms
SO IPSI BGD TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Blockchain (BC) technologies have a potential to blend with the existing Internet of things (IoT) platforms. BC enabled IoT platforms can be offered as a service (BIoTaaS) to provide scalable and trusted new approaches in e.g. IoT device authentication and management, trading with IoT data or in providing reliable and trusted interfaces between Web and smart contracts. At the same time this can lead to a gradual decentralization of highly centralized traditional cloud platforms - a needed change in IoT that can be anticipated from the fog computation and communication architectures, too. Currently the two viable BC candidates for BIoTaaS are the Ethereum (ETH) and the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). Very diverse applications of BIoTaaS are possible, so it is unlikely that one platform approach or architecture will be meeting all these needs. Two differentiators have the key impact on selection of BC technology for particular BIoTaaS: existence of need for instant and independent on-chain payments and where the dominant focus is set - on the IoT devices or on the business-to-business (B2B) applications. If the devices are central and payments are required, then ETH BC is the favorite. In case of B2B HLF might be a preferable option due to security features beyond trust, derived from the permissioned network model. Beside the existence of BC, other requirements have to be met for efficient BIoTaaS. We defined a set of such common requirements, which include Web/HTTP/REST and other acknowledged application programming interfaces (API) for entire IoT and BC service access, on-chain smart contracts, low transaction confirmation delays for instant payments and near real-time operation, and smart oracles for interfacing the off-chain "real-world" objects and systems.

SO IPSI BGD TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET RESEARCH
AB This paper presents a prototype implementation of a USB charging device with Ethereum blockchain support for booking and payments. It outlines the design of the system and selection of hardware and software components for the end-to-end solution. Blockchain technologies are relatively new and promising development for decentralized trusted transactions, including micropayments. There are many possible application domains of blockchain technology envisaged; one of them is smart grid. Several initiatives are prototyping solutions in this domain; however, there is still a vast unexplored area related to technological and business aspects of blockchain in energetics. Our prototype provides an end-to-end solution that is comprised of a blockchain enabled end-device, Web applications with blockchain clients for users and administrators, and corresponding smart contracts for the specific transaction logics. The prototype was implemented as a DIN rail compatible device based on RPi and a user application as Javascript code embedded in HTML page that can be opened in Chrome browser with Metamask plugin installed. The system was successfully implemented and tested and it confirmed the viability of the concept. With modest modifications this approach could be extended to electric vehicle chargers, smart grid supply and demand management or other utility support systems.

AB Bitcoin holds the largest market share among all digital currencies. Transaction security is secured in Bitcoin by using blocks with a hash-based Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism. Bitcoin PoW takes an average of 10-minutes to complete and 6 consecutive blocks are recommended for a single transaction in the system. PoW is a functional protocol that validates every incoming data to overcome spam attacks and DDoS attacks (Distributed Denial of Service). Selfish miner is an attack on the integrity of the Bitcoin network. The selfish miner succeeds because the honest miners are forced to spend part of their computing cycle on blocks that are destined not to be in the public chain. To achieve higher scalability, network latency must be low, that is the time required for the protocol to confirm the transaction should be effectively reduced. In this study, the author will make a simulation of the effect of latency on block receive time on Bitcoin with selfish-miner attack using NS3. The experimental results show the use of the latency variation and the more number of generated blocks, the lower the MBRT value. The average MBRT of each parameter shows the required receive time by the block number of about 15 minutes to 16 minutes. This amount exceeds the PoW's tolerance time limit when making a transaction. This is due of selfish-miner attack and Latency.

AB With the development of digital inclusive finance, the deficiency of traditional personal credit system is becoming more and more obvious. In order to make up for its defects, financial science and technology are applied in the field of personal credit investigation, but the credit information sharing is insufficient. The problem of weak protection of personal credit information still exists and needs to be solved urgently. Starting with the necessity of constructing personal credit system based on financial science and technology, this paper reveals the current situation and existing problems of Internet credit investigation and big data credit investigation. Then, the block chain technology is introduced into the personal credit system. The block chain technology with both sharing and security will promote the construction of the new personal credit investigation system. And from the aspects of necessity, solution and significance to inclusive finance, this paper expounds that block chain credit investigation solves the problem of insufficient sharing of credit information and weak protection of personal credit information. Then, on the basis of the positive significance of the application of block chain technology in the field of personal credit, the paper points out the technical bottleneck and potential risks of the application of block chain technology in personal credit system. Finally, the conclusion of this paper and the suggestion of developing personal credit system based on financial science and technology under the perspective of digital inclusive finance are put forward.

AB Blockchain as a novel technology which consists of peer-to-peer network, distributed consensus, cryptography and other fundamental knowledge. Blockchain can help people build trust among untrusted people, which will help people establish new application models in multiple areas. But there are several legacy problems which obstruct the deployment and development of blockchain, the biggest problem is blockchain performance that blockchain cannot process the transactions as much as the centralized server per second. We propose a cascade structure for blockchain, which can accelerate the block generation, enlarge the capacity of the block, reduce the risk of fork and increase the difficulty to launch the 51% attack.

AB The construction of smart city involves multiple corporate organizations and government agencies, while smart city operations often require data across organizations. This paper describes a blockchain-based approach to exchange information in smart cities that assists sharing data across multiple, nontrusted organizations. The proposed method enables an organization safely use data from another organization to participate in business operations without accessing the data. The data that participates in operations is in an encrypted form stored only in the executor sandbox. Consensus calculations are performed on multiple nodes by smart contract. After the confirmation through multiple nodes, the result of the calculation will be returned to the applicant. Thus, the risk of data leakage could be avoided. Our proposed method can effectively prevent the access to the information from being illegally obtained, used, and tampered. Also it ensures the reliable use of the data which enables the effective information sharing and protection of information among multiple organizations in the smart city applications.

AB With the increasing difficulty of solo mining in blockchain mining, pool mining has become more and more popular, and most of the miners would like to join a mining pool and contribute their computational power to the pool. When the pool finds a valid block and get the reward from the blockchain network, it will distribute the reward to its miners according to its reward mechanism. In practice, the Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS) mechanism is one of the most commonly used mechanisms by pools, and the pool adopting PPLNS mechanism will distribute the reward to the miners whose reported shares are in the last N shares, according to their proportion of the number of shares in the last N shares. In the PPLNS mechanism, different reporting strategies may bring different rewards for miners. Thus, how to report their found shares to the pool has become an important issue faced by the miners. In this paper, we study the share reporting problem faced by the miners in PPLNS pools, and establish a share reporting optimization model for the miners. We also study the effect of the parameter N in the PPLNS mechanism on the optimal reporting strategies of the miners. With the computational experiments approach, we design experiments to evaluate our proposed share reporting strategies. This work is the first attempt to study the share reporting issue faced by miners in PPLNS pools, and it can provide useful managerial insights for miners when making their share reporting decisions in such pools.

AB Recently, rapid advances in information and communications technologies (ICTs) have improved the performance of software-defined industrial Internet of things (SDIIoT). Due to a variety of data, flows and smart devices in SDIIoT, a distributed SDN control plane is necessary. However, how to achieve consensus among controllers efficiently and safely is an intractable problem. In this paper, we use a permissioned blockchain approach to reach consensus in distributed SDIIoT. Since lots of data needs to be synchronized, and the throughput of traditional Byzantine fault tolerance protocol used in permissioned blockchain is limited by many aspects, i.e., the trust features of nodes in blockchain, the trust features of controllers in distributed SDIIoT, and the computing capacity of blockchain, we jointly consider these aspects to improve the throughput of permissioned blockchain. Accordingly, we formulate view change, access selection, and computing resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. This joint problem is highly dimensional, and is hard to be solved by traditional methods. Therefore, we propose a dueling deep Q-learning approach to address the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

SO FORESIGHT
AB Purpose - The cyber security industry emerged rapidly in recent years due to mounting cyber threats and increasing cyber hacking activities. Research on emerging technologies emphasizes the risks and sometimes neglects to address the potential positive contribution to cyber security. The purpose of this study is to conduct a relatively balanced long-term foresight study to elicit major significant threat drivers and to identify emerging technologies that are likely to have a significant impact on defense and attack capabilities in cyber security.
   Design/methodology/approach - The main instruments used in this study were horizon scanning and an online survey among subject-matter experts that assessed emerging threats and the potential impact of several emerging technologies on cyber defense capabilities and cyber attack capabilities.
   Findings - An expert survey shows that cyber resilience, homomorphic encryption and blockchain may be considered as technologies contributing mainly to defense capabilities. On the other hand, Internet of Things, biohacking and human machine interface (HMI) and autonomous technologies add mainly to attack capabilities. In the middle, we find autonomous technologies, quantum computing and artificial intelligence that contribute to defense, as well as to attack capabilities, with roughly similar impact on both.
   Originality/value - This study adds to the current research a balanced long-term view and experts' assessment of negative and positive impacts of emerging technologies, including their time to maturity and consensus levels. Two new Likert scale measures were applied to measure the potential impact of emerging technologies on cyber security, thus enabling the classification of the results into four groups (net positive, net negative, positive-positive and negative-negative).

AB As the deployments of IoT systems grow for a wide range of applications, there are new use-cases emerging where the organizations or individuals that own sensor devices are different from the individuals or organizations that have use for the data from those devices. In such settings it is helpful for the data consumer to be able to effortlessly get data streams in return for monetary payments. The advent of cryptocurrency technologies have made the establishment of bidirectional automatic data micro-payment channels (with data flowing in one direction and micro-payments in the other) feasible. We present an application layer protocol called the streaming data payment protocol (SDPP) which embodies this very idea. The protocol also makes provisions for the data provider to send automated invoices and the data consumer to provide signed receipts for data to be stored on an immutable distributed ledger for auditing and dispute resolution purposes. We present an implementation of SDPP using TCP for data transport and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger.

AB We design a distributed platform with blockchain as a system service for supporting transaction execution in insurance processes. The insurance industry is heavily dependent on multiple processes between transacting parties for initiating, maintaining and closing diverse kind of policies. Transaction processing time, payment settlement time and security protection of the process execution are major concerns. Blockchain technology, originally conceived as an immutable distributed ledger for detecting double spending of cryptocurrencies, is now increasingly used in different FinTech systems to address productivity and security requirements. The application of blockchain in FinTech processing requires a deep understanding of the underlying business processes. It supports automated interactions between the blockchain and existing transaction systems through the notion of smart contracts. In this paper, we focus on the design of an efficient approach for processing insurance related transactions based on a blockchain-enabled platform. An experimental prototype is developed on Hyperledger fabric, an open source permissioned blockchain design framework. We discuss the main design requirements, corresponding design propositions, and encode various insurance processes as smart contracts. Extensive experiments were conducted to analyze performance of our framework and security of the proposed design.

AB The rise of the Internet changed the way how financial markets work. Due to user generated content, quite everybody might contribute to the large set of information and the exchange of news happens faster than ever. An important variable in such new era is sentiment, which causes market participants to act on noisy signals from Internet as they were valid inputs. Importantly, sentiment is considered the crucial ingredient in price formation of now increasingly attractive digital currencies. Investors' beliefs affect exchange rates of those currencies considerably simply because of lack of fundamentals and regulation. In this paper we will examine the relationship between sentiment and price of the most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. We will employ three measures of sentiment constructed by Sentix survey with aim to explore the effect of both institutional and individual investor's sentiment as well as overall sentiment of the community.

AB The healthcare industry is constantly reforming and adopting new shapes with respect to the technological evolutions and transitions. One of the crucial requirements in the current smart healthcare systems is the protection of patients sensitive data against the potential adversaries. Therefore, it is vital to have secure data access mechanisms that can ensure only authorized entities can access the patients medical information. Hence, this paper considers blockchain technology as a distributed approach protect the data in healthcare systems. This research proposes a blockchain based secure and efficient data accessibility mechanism for the patient and the doctor in a given healthcare system. Proposed system able to protect the privacy of the patients as well. The security analysis of our scheme shows that it can resist to well-known attacks along with maintaining the integrity of the system. Moreover, an Ethereum based implementation has used to verify the feasibility of our proposed system.

AB In this paper, sic first propose an adaptive strategy for double-spending attack on blockchains. The attacker in our strategy observes the length of the honest branch when a submitted transaction becomes available in the blockchaiti and then updates the attack strategy accordingly. This provides a stronger strategy than conventional double spending attack. We then derive closed-form expressions for the probability of a successful attack and the expected reward of attacker miners. Our analysis shows that the probability of a successful attack by convincing the network nodes to follow the counterfeit branch under the proposed attack strategy is 60% higher than what is expected from the conventional attack strategy when the attackers acquire 40% of the total network processing power To counter this increase in the probability of attack, the network nodes are required to use a bigger number of confirmation blocks for validating an transaction in the blockchain. We computed the expected reward of an attacker for mining a counterfeit branch on a blockchain and observed that the expected reward drops to zero after a taw number of block confirmations.

AB This article describes how the rise in technological innovation has allowed for transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) to expand their operations using virtual platforms such as social media and online video games. These virtual platforms are utilized by TCOs to conduct some of their traditional forms of crimes, such a money laundering. These criminal practices have found solace in technological innovation, mainly through the exploitation of rising technologies, such as online video games, video game consoles and peripherals, such as Virtual Reality headsets, inconspicuous electronic devices for children, Near-Field Communication (NFC), and finally, social media as tool for recruitment and immediate communication. TCOs have managed to utilize these mediums to conduct their criminal activities in part due to the lack or nonexistence of new or proper legislation that regulates how these new mediums can function without facilitating illicit activities and the germination of illicit markets.

AB In 2008 Blockchain became known by Whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, author of the article "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." Blockchain technology facilitates peer-to-peer transactions without the intermediary, which is safe and trust.
   Blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create a digital ledger of transactions and share it among a distributed network of computers, continuously updated simultaneously and secure with encryption.
   Furthermore, blockchain uses cryptography to allow each participant on the network to manipulate the ledger in a secure way without the need for a centralized trusted party. Since the Bitcoin protocol is open source. This concept has led to the idea develop of smart contract.
   Blockchain technology can apply in non-Financial Uses which have application examples in many industries include energy sector. Energy Sector can apply this technology from grid management to retail & customer experience that will transformation to new business model.

AB Blockchain-based systems such as cryptocurrencies are achieving widespread usage, with a market capitalization of $150B (USD) as of September 2017. However, the most prominent platforms that account for over 70% of this market - Bitcoin & Ethereum - are exhibiting increasingly lower levels of decentralization. This poses the problem of concentrating levers of consensus to a select group of agents in the system. At the same time, attempts at higher levels of decentralization poses the problem of limiting scalability of such systems. In this paper, using mechanism design we propose a way of designing payoffs in order to disincentivize certain exhibited behaviors and incentivize desired behaviors of miners in such systems. Our approach indicates potential for research in this area for solving the much larger problem of centralization in decentralized systems such as blockchain.

AB Blockchain provides decentralized consensus in large, open networks without a trusted authority, making it a promising solution for the Internet of Things (IoT) to distribute verifiable data, such as firmware updates. However, verifying data integrity and consensus on a linearly growing blockchain quickly exceeds memory and processing capabilities of embedded systems. As a remedy, we propose a generic blockchain extension that enables highly constrained devices to verify the inclusion and integrity of any block within a blockchain. Instead of traversing block by block, we construct a LeapChain that reduces verification steps without weakening the integrity guarantees of the blockchain. Applied to Proof-of-Work blockchains, our scheme can be used to verify consensus by proving a certain amount of work on top of a block. Our analytical and experimental results show that, compared to existing approaches, only LeapChain provides deterministic and tight upper bounds on the memory requirements in the kilobyte range, significantly extending the possibilities of blockchain application on embedded IoT devices.

AB Today we are living in the 21st century where with the increase in technological advancements and IOT, human race is facing a large breakdown in security issues. With the fast-technological advancement, we face certain problems in our daily life. Vehicle security is one of the major issues in the current era.
   Car automation and surveillance is an escalating trend in this decade. The vehicle security has become a need of the time. In this paper we propose a real-time security system with a live 360-degree view of the vehicle and intelligence to the system made through using various sensors to pin point the area of contact to the vehicle which will be added advantage to the owner of the vehicle. We are using a security system which senses the motion, sends a notification to the owner, and the owners can also see the video through camera in their mobile phone app. The system works on the principle of real-time camera surveillance system. Moreover, the proposed system can also be extended to inculcate the concept of Ad-hoc networking in intelligent cars, to send a warning to the car at the back, in case of an accident which will press the brakes of car to stop at a safe distance. This paper lies in the field of Internet of things (IOT), Block chain, Smart cities, Data analytics, Mobile application, Knowledge management, Digital transformation, Networking, Wireless/Mobile Communication, Statistics in Society Signal Processing using smart cars using Raspberry pi, Sensors, Cameras, GPRS, GPS.

AB Off-chain transaction handling like the Lightning Network (LN) is among the most promising solutions to solve the scaling challenges in blockchain technology like Bitcoin. At the same time, the LN faces its own challenges like transaction path lengths, centralization of channels (hubs), channel imbalances (depletion), etc. Here we study the effects of payment channel fees on these various factors. To get realistic insights, we based our study on empirical Bitcoin transaction patterns and existing LN structure, and apply a simple form of fee structure with only one tunable parameter, a, that is most influential on the transaction routing paths. We assume the transactions through the LN take the path of the lowest aggregate fees, and found as a consequence that one cannot have short average path lengths and low overall channel imbalances at the same time. A good compromise is to have fees proportional to the square root of the channel capacity, such that reasonably short path lengths and overall balanced channel capacities can be achieved that makes the operation of the LN more sustainable.

AB Ring signature is a variant of digital signature, which makes any member in a group generate signatures representing this group with anonymity and unforgeability. In recent years, ring signatures have been employed as a kind of anonymity technology in the blockchain-based cryptocurrency such as Monero. Recently Malavolta et al. introduced a novel ring signature protocol that has anonymity and unforgeability in the standard model [33]. Their construction paradigm is based on non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) arguments of knowledge and re-randomizable keys.
   In this work, for the purpose of lower bandwidth cost in blockchain, we improve their ring signature by proposing a compact NIZK argument of knowledge. We show our NIZK holds under a new complexity assumption Compact Linear Knowledge of Exponent Assumption. Without the expense of security, our proposed ring signature scheme is anonymous and unforgeable in the standard model. It saves almost half of storage space of signature, and reduces almost half of pairing computations in verification process. When the ring size is large, the effect of our improvements is obvious.

AB Cloud storage is now a hot research topic in information technology, which has changed the technical architecture and implementation method of electronic record management. However, due to loss of physical control of the electronic record in cloud storage environment, it is more difficult to guarantee the consistency of record owner.
   The blockchain is a distributed decentralized ledger, in which data cannot be forged or tampered. In the paper, the consistency guarantee method of electronic record based on Blockchain is proposed. To ensure the consistency of the electronic record in the cloud storage servers, this paper replaces the skip list to store the electronic record in the blockchain with the traditional Merkle tree. Moreover, we use the hash values generated by tags and array to ensure the integrity of the tags, reduce the computation and communication cost of update and to search for the electronic record.

AB Bitcoin, as well as many of its successors, require the whole transaction record to be reliably acquired by all nodes to prevent double-spending. Recently, many blockchains have been proposed to achieve scale-out throughput by letting nodes only acquire a fraction of the whole transaction set. However, these schemes, e.g., sharding and off-chain techniques, suffer from a degradation in decentralization or the capacity of fault tolerance.
   In this paper, we show that the complete set of transactions is not a necessity for the prevention of double-spending if the properties of value transfers is fully explored. In other words, we show that a value-transfer ledger like Bitcoin has the potential to scale-out by its nature without sacrificing security or decentralization. Firstly, we give a formal definition for the value-transfer ledger and its distinct features from a generic database. Then, we introduce the blockchain structure with a shared main chain for consensus and an individual chain for each node for recording transactions. A locally executable validation scheme is proposed with uncompromising validity and consistency. A beneficial consequence of our design is that nodes will spontaneously try to reduce their transmission cost by only providing the transactions needed to show that their transactions are not double spend. As a result, the network is sharded as each node only acquires part of the transaction record and a scale-out throughput could be achieved, which we call "spontaneous sharding".

In particular, local electricity markets (LEMs) seem to provide applications for the usage of blockchain technology. Through its innovative design as a distributed and decentralized information system, blockchain supporters see its potential in organizing residential households and prosumers in LEMs. We assess the current maturity of blockchain-based applications for LEMs. To this end, we develop a blockchain maturity model that constitutes a framework for analyzing the current and future maturity of blockchain-based LEMs in a comprehensive structured approach. In a second step, we apply the new blockchain maturity model to an use case of a blockchain-based LEM. Our assessment shows that, in the current status, the project is in an early stage of maturity due to missing regulatory rules and standardization.

TI The velvet cage of educational con(pro)sumption
SO OPEN REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH
AB In the year that George Ritzer publishes the ninth edition of The McDonaldization of Society, moving his famous theory firmly Into the Digital Age, critical educator Petar Jandric and sociologist Sarah Hayes invited George to a dialogue on the digital transformation of McDonaldization and its critical application to Higher Education. In this article, George first traces for us the origins of his theory that has endured for four decades. A key dimension of McDonaldization is the 'iron cage' of control, via rationalization. Once contained within physical sites of bricks and mortar, now, we encounter a 'velvet cage' in sites of digital consumption, at the hands of non-human technologies, that threaten human labor and autonomy. Whilst the concept of the McUniversity is not without some critique, this interview provides compelling reasons to open new dialogue about McDonaldization in augmented settings such as Higher Education. With the rise of prosuming machines such as blockchain and bitcoin, that can both produce and consume without intervention from human 'prosumers', universities cannot afford to ignore the challenges of prosumer capitalism, which George concludes, will explode into unprecedented and unpredictable directions in the years to come.

TI A BIT LIKE CASH: UNDERSTANDING CASH-FOR-BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS THROUGH
   INDIVIDUAL VENDORS
SO JOURNAL OF DIGITAL FORENSICS SECURITY AND LAW
AB As technology improves and economies become more globalized, the concept of currency has evolved. Bitcoin, a cryptographic digital currency, has been embraced as a secure and convenient type of money. Due to its security and privacy for the user, Bitcoin is a good tool for conducting criminal trades. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has regulations in place to make identification information of Bitcoin purchasers accessible to law enforcement, but enforcing these rules with cash-for-Bitcoin traders is difficult. This study surveyed cash-for-Bitcoin vendors in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico to determine personal demographic information, knowledge of and compliance with FinCEN regulations, and opinions regarding government control of currency and willingness to work with law enforcement among vendors.

AB Even though blockchain is mostly popular for its cryptocurrency, smart contracts have become a very prominent blockchain application. Smart contracts are like classes that can be called by client applications outside the blockchain. Therefore it is possible to develop blockchain-oriented software (BOS) that implements part of the business logic in the blockchain by using smart contracts. Currently, there is no design standard to model BOS. Since modeling is an important part of designing a software, developers may struggle to plan their BOS. In this paper, we show three complementary modeling approaches based on well-known software engineering models and apply them to a BOS example. Our goal is to start the discussion on specialized blockchain modeling notations.

TI LEGAL REGULATION ISSUES OF CRYPTOCURRENCY CIRCULATION IN UKRAINE
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB The aim of the article is a comparative legal study of laws and regulations that determine the legal principles for the regulation of cryptocurrency circulation in some foreign countries and in Ukraine and, on this basis, a definition of ways to improve domestic legislation in this sphere. The subject of the study is an interrogation of legal regulation issues of cryptocurrency circulation in Ukraine. Methodology. The study is based on a legal comparison of the regulation of cryptocurrency circulation in Ukraine and in foreign countries. Based on a comparative legal study of certain provisions of Ukrainian legislation, the possibilities and limits of implementation of positive foreign experience in this sphere are determined. The results of the study revealed that to implement foreign experience for the legal regulation of cryptocurrency circulation, it is necessary to postpone the final transition to a floating rate regime by reinforcing state interference. Moreover, it is necessary to strengthen currency control not only for currency transactions with cryptocurrency but also for the activities of entities that determine the state policy on cryptocurrency regulation, as well as operate respectively using instruments provided for by the regulations of the current legislation. Practical implications. The positive experience of the formation of the foreign exchange market in other countries demonstrates that the gradual transition to cryptocurrency circulation is the beginning of the natural market rate, the balance of payments and gradual liberation of the national economy from the pressure of administrative and corruption restrictions. Relevance/originality. The legal analysis of the regulation of cryptocurrency circulation in Ukraine and the definition of problems is the basis for developing the most promising directions for the development of domestic legislation in this sphere.

AB Over the past few years, Bitcoin has been a topic of interest of many, from academic researchers to trade investors. Bitcoin is the first as well as the most popular cryptocurrency till date. Since its launch in 2009, it has become widely popular amongst various kinds of people for its trading system without the need of a third party and also due to high volatility of Bitcoin price. In this paper, we propose a suitable model that can predict the market price of Bitcoin best by applying a few statistical analysis. Our work is done on four year's bitcoin data from 2013 to 2017 based on time series approaches especially autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the work finally could acquire an accuracy of 90% for deciding volatility in weighted costs of bitcoin in the short run.

AB Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) protocols can mitigate attacks and errors and are increasingly investigated as consensus protocols in blockchains. However, they are traditionally considered costly in terms of message complexity and latency due to the required multiple rounds of message exchanges. With the availability of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) in data centers, message exchange latency can be reduced compared to TCP, as RDMA enables kernel bypassing and thereby avoids intermediate data copying. Retaining the performance benefits for RDMA during its integration, however, is non-trivial and error-prone. While the use of RDMA has previously been explored for key/value stores, databases and distributed file systems, agreement protocols especially for BFT have so far been neglected. We investigate the usage of RDMA in the Reptor BFT protocol for low-latency agreement and show first steps towards an RDMA-enabled consensus protocol. For this, we present RUBIN, a framework offering similar functionality to the Java NIO selector, which can handle multiple network connections efficiently with a single thread and is employed in several BFT protocol implementations such as BFT-SMART and UpRight.

Possible limitation of feed-in tariffs or electrical energy exported into the grid often challenge existence of distributed biogeneration. Since, electrical energy cost had crucial influence on feasibility of cryptocurrencies minings, presented paper suggest definition of levelized cost of Bitcoin. However, participation in mining activity request higher efficiency of electrical energy generation. Combined heat and power plants can perform in trigeneration mode and this will enhance total energy performance for mining farms due to reduction of energy consumption far mining rigs cooling.

AB Inspired by the online peer-to-peer (P2P) goods trading that has become increasingly popular in the recent years, in this paper we propose a decentralized P2P electricity marketing mechanism for a microgrid (MG) consisting of networked prosumer (consumers with distributed generation capability) clusters by incorporating Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts (SC). Our proposed electricity marketing mechanism is a two-level hierarchical one: In the upper level, the aggregators (AGGs) cooperate with each other and in the lower level, the local PRs maximize their financial profits via P2P energy trading. This mechanisms potentially results in price of anarchy instances in which the targets of the two level players will be contradictory. To address this issue, we assume that there exists a single universal cost function for both levels of the game. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of our proposed P2P electricity marketing mechanism in maximizing the self-sufficiency of the microgrid and minimizing the side effects of the discriminatory pricing.

AB The emerging data-driven techniques have greatly increased the demand for effective data sharing infrastructure, which is our fundamental motivation in designing effective data trade paradigms. One of the critical challenges of data sharing is to achieve a good trade-off between the privacy and data utility. To address this challenge, in this paper we exploit the Blockchain techniques and contract theory to design a Blockchain-based peer-to-peer data trading mechanism. In our proposed mechanism, the data trading is supported by Ethereum Blockhain technique. To effectively capture and regulate the complex interaction between the data aggregators (AGG) and the data owners, we propose a contract theoretic approach to design the smart contract that is the essential component of Ethereum Blockchain. The performance of our proposed Blockchain-enabled data trading mechanism is evaluated.

AB "Overflowing" the national economic systems, active growth of the global crypto-currency market forms a new type of economic relations. Despite the fact that at the current time a single (unified) approach to the legal regulation of the crypto-currency market has not yet been worked out in the world community, the crypto-currency is considered by many world regulators as a promising tool in the monetary policy of national economies. In this regard, it seems extremely urgent to solve the problem that reveals the features of the development of the market under study, as well as the possibility of its forecasting for the medium and long periods of time. The aim of the work is to find and scientifically substantiate the tools and mechanisms for developing predictive assessments of the development of the crypto-currency market. The process of economic and mathematical modeling of time series characterizing the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate, based on the use of the ARMA class of autoregressive moving average models is the subject of the study. Based on the evaluations and calculations, it is proved that the use of the ARIMA model class in the process of modeling the parameters of the development of the global crypto-currency market allows us to predict with a high level of accuracy not only current but also future digital currency rate adjustments.

AB The age of deep learning is picking up in a way that increases the curiosity in man to make the world of predictions as realistic as possible. In pursuit of achieving this goal, he comes up with approximate algorithms([8]), that predict satisfactorily with long training despite the use of GPUs. A deep learning model is not perfect, unless it accommodates new trends and the data of latest discovery that would impact significantly in future inferences. Assimilating this critical data into the pre-trained deep learning model([6]) involves validity of the data. A Blockchain-like structure could be incorporated atop the data, validate and introduce the authentic data to the under-performing pre-trained model. We call this a blended learning which uses blockchainified data to fine tune the model. This idea of secure data assistance to update pre-trained model opens up a novel field of research that brings a synergy between Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Blockchain.

AB Nowadays, the cloud hosts the majority of IoT virtualizations. This approach depends on an active Internet connection. The question that emerges is how we can move those virtualizations to the edge of IoT networks without losing the power and flexibility from the cloud but fulfilling the requirements of constrained and pervasive environments. This research presents an architecture that integrates dew computing to provision virtual resources at the edge level. This architecture proposes smart virtual resources deployed towards edge devices to provide data views and IoT services to users. This approach goes beyond traditional IoT virtualizations and builds distributed virtual systems that include the benefits of the cloud, fog, and dew computing to provide services directly at the edge level.

AB In this demo we present E-Witness, a system that uses blockchain technology to prove the integrity and spatio-temporal properties of digital evidence captured through a smart-phone. The system consists of a smart-phone application that computes robust hash of pictures or videos taken from the phone camera, a location attestation service and a public blockchain which contains ledger entries to preserve the evidence file's hash and location certificate. The human witness can remain anonymous in this process. An investigator who receives the evidence (by any means) can verify the integrity and spatio-temporal claims of the evidence by querying the blockchain.

AB The use of Blockchain Technology in the Internet of Things will let applications in numerous domains such as Smart home, Industrial Automation, Transportation etc thrive by easily monitoring, tracking and securing data. IoT solutions using blockchain helps in transferring and verifying transactions in a secure manner. However, there are many blockchain platforms available that vary in many ways such as their purpose, ease of participation, governance etc. To determine which blockchain implementation should be leveraged for applying to IoTs, there exists a need for comparing different blockchain platforms. One important aspect we can consider for comparison is the energy consumption of blockchains and analyzing energy-performance trade-offs. Towards this goal, we profile the impact of workloads and further quantify the power consumed by different operations performed on the Ethereum platform and Hyperledger Fabric platform. In contrast to existing approaches that are focused on performance, we characterize performance and energy consumption for real workloads and analyze energy-performance tradeoffs. The insights from the study can be used in developing secure protocols for IoTs using blockchains.

AB Blockchain inspires many people across the globe and has started getting many adoptions after realizing its promising benefits through successful trials. Applications of blockchain range from cryptocurrency, smart contract, banking, healthcare and identity management, insurance, land registry to IoT industry. However, scalability and throughput issues are major challenges of blockchain and are less researched. Many lightweight nodes especially IoT devices depend and put much workload on blockchain servers since they cannot store the full blockchain due to its huge size. This paper investigates performance bottlenecks in blockchain and presents efficient high performance system for caching the blockchain data in the FPGA network interface controller (NIC) for improving scalability and throughput of blockchain applications. We design a customized SHA-256 hash core specific for efficient blockchain caching to save hashing executions and improve the performance. We built and use Jansson and Curl libraries to interface our system with real Bitcoin core. We finally evaluate the throughput performance of the Bitcoin core. The overall result revealed that our system improves the throughput performance by 103 times when cache hit. The design also offers small work area utilization, low power consumption and higher performance.

AB Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are one of the leading classification algorithms and have achieved big milestones such as GoogleNet and AlphaGo. Training of neural network is a time-consuming affair and is proportional to the depth of network and number of computations carried out in each layer. If the network is deep, the time taken is considerably high as it works sequentially on batches of dataset using Sequential Back-propagation (BP) Algorithm. This paper presents an acceleration technique DAPP Accelerating Training of DNN using Ping-Pong approach to reduce the training time using distributed local memory. DAPP exploits model parallelism without compromising the accuracy of the model. The proposed pipeline design concurrently works on consecutive set of batches to compute gradients at various layers, while eliminating the need for global memory. Simulation of DAPP is done on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets using System-C. Additionally, this technique has been adapted for multi-core architectures. This generic methodology has been implemented for CNN, Vanilla RNN and LSTM networks. This design reduces training time by 40% for a 3 layer CNN, 92% for a 10 layer CNN, 38% for Vanilla RNN, and 40% for LSTM while maintaining the accuracy in all above networks.

AB Now a days many applications are being built using the immutability and robustness of blockchain. Blockchain is a new class of information technology which combines cryptography and distributed ledger that already exists. The model is composed of a group of computers that collaborate towards maintaining a secured database, without storing the data at any central unit. It is the technology behind all the crypto currencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Etherum and now finding its way to record everything possible. This paper focuses on the basic framework of blockchain model, its development history, prerequisites and challenges of blockchain. Finally, various current real time applications of the technology are discussed.

AB Current job recruitment process involves a good number of documentations. It is not uncommon for job applicants to misrepresent, overstate or falsify past employment, specifically work experience, and skills. Where this occurs and the applicant is subsequently appointed, a company may be exposed to significant commercial and legal risk. Companies usually employ third party HR recruitment agencies to verify the authenticity of an applicant's listed work experience. However, verification of applicant's past work experience is both time consuming and costly. Moreover, companies have to rely on the third parties, which may not be trustworthy. Therefore, small and medium size companies usually avoid the verification process. In this research, we demonstrate how blockchain technology can provide cost-effective, and real-time work history verification. The proposed approach also ensures trustworthy and privacy-preserving (work-history)data sharing. Furthermore, we have implemented a prototype to demonstrate how individuals can share and verify work history using Ethereum-based public blockchain.

AB The convergence which brought with the globalizing world, highly affects the network and the communication sectors. Mostly closed source and centralized systems are used for network and communication. This contradicts with the information security principles and privacy. These centralized systems can not fully meet the concept of transparent, reliable, fast and uninterrupted communication. Distributed, decentralized and also transparent communication is possible with the blockchain technology. In this study, a communication application which is based on blockchain technology is proposed. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is preferred to overcome the limits of the blockchain. A prototype implementation called Cryptouch is proposed. Application features and potential benefits are discussed.

AB Blockchain platform has given information system scholars research opportunities in understanding dynamics of convergence of technology and social context. The information system research issues are complex and require taxonomies to understand the similarities and uniqueness among objects. Developing taxonomies is a complex process that needs systematic approach. This paper is a research-in-progress. We proposed taxonomy for Blockchain platform using existing method of developing taxonomies in information systems. With the unprecedented growth led to several companies to develop the varieties of Blockchain platforms. The complexity in the implementation and understanding the technical protocols leading to difficulty face by researchers and practitioners to access their full potentials. To bridge the gap, we proposed a taxonomy of Blockchains distributed ledger platforms in order to provide a mechanism for researchers and practitioners to understand the phenomenon. Final of taxonomy contains five (5) dimensions with fifteen (15) characteristics. Our analysis discovered Blockchain platforms are designed with specific goals, which prescribe its features, i.e FinTech Blockchain platforms for financial domain.

TI TURNING THE INTERNATIONAL NORTH-SOUTH CORRIDOR INTO A "DIGITAL CORRIDOR"
SO SRAVNITELNAYA POLITIKA-COMPARATIVE POLITICS
AB At present, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is being widely discussed among policy makers and academia as on the ground progress is fast taking shape. The project has primarily remained an initiative of four major participating states - i.e. India, Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia that are territorially located along the route of the corridor. Private businesses, whether local companies or multinational corporations, have not been very interested to jointly develop the project, mostly out of their concerns for assured returns on investments. The study builds a comprehensive case for the participating states to actively engage the private companies for developing the mega-connectivity project. The latter holds an advantage over advanced digital technologies in the global markets. Hence, public-private partnerships will bring about application of advanced digital technologies, like IoT, Blockchain technology, etc., which will efficiently serve the needs of different activities happening along the entire length of the corridor. This, in turn, will increase the overall strength and utility of the corridor. thereby ensuring its lasting success.

AB Enterprises have paid attention to blockchain (BC), recently permissioned BC characterized with smart-contract, where business transactions among inter-authorized companies (forming consortium) can automatically be executed based on distributed consensus protocol over user-defined business logics pre-built with program codes. A single BC system will be built across multiple management domains having different operational policies, e.g., datacenter of each organization; this will trigger a problem that its system operations (e.g., backup) will become time-consuming and costly due to the difficulty in unifying and/or adjusting operational policy, schedule, etc. Toward solving the problem, we propose an operations execution method for BC systems; a primary idea is to define operations as smart-contract so that unified and synchronized cross-organizational operations can be executed effectively by using BC-native features. We design the proposed method as hybrid architecture including in-BC consensus establishment and out-BC event-based instruction execution, in order to be adaptable to the recent heterogeneous BC architecture. Performance evaluation using a prototype with Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 shows that the proposed method can start executing operations within 5 seconds. Furthermore, cost evaluation using model-based estimation shows that the total yearly cost of monthly operations on a 5-organizational BC system could be reduced by 61 percent compared to a conventional manual method.

AB The rise of distributed energy generation technologies along with grid constraints, and conventional non-consumer centric business models, is leading many to explore alternative configurations of the energy system. Particularly popular are peer-to-peer energy trading models in which the role of the energy company is replaced with a trustless transaction layer based on a public blockchain. However, to ensure stable operation of microgrids, an energy company is required to constantly balance supply and demand. In this paper, we study the problem that arises from the conflicting goals of prosumers (to make money) and network operators (to keep the network stable) that have to co-exist in future energy systems. We show that prosumers can play large-scale synchronization games to benefit from the system. If they synchronize their actions to artificially increase energy demand on the market, the resulting power peaks will force the microgrid operator to use backup generation capacities and, as a consequence, contribute to the increased profit margins for prosumers. We study synchronization games from a game-theoretical point of view and argue that even non-cooperative selfish prosumers can learn to play synchronization games independently and enforce undesired outcomes for consumers and the grid. We build a simple model where prosumers independently run Q-learning algorithms to learn their most profitable strategies and show that synchronization games constitute a Nash equilibrium. We discuss implications of our findings and argue the necessity of appropriate mechanism design for stable microgrid operation.

AB Despite the very high volatility of the cryptocurrency markets, the interest in the development and adaptation of existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as well as new distributed ledger technologies is increasing. Therefore, understanding the security and vulnerability issues of such blockchain systems plays a critical role. In this work, we propose a configurable distributed simulation framework for analyzing Bitcoin-like blockchain systems which are based on Proof-of-Work protocols. The simulator facilitates investigating security properties of blockchain systems by enabling users to configure several characteristics of the blockchain network and executing different attack scenarios, such as double-spending attacks and flood attacks and observing the effects of the attacks on the blockchain network.

Therefore, the research areas of automated negotiations (including the elicitation of negotiation strategies) and smart contracting, i.e. the automated creation of smart contracts, can be combined, to enable automation of the contracting and the contract fulfillment.

AB The ubiquitous ID (uID) architecture provides dynamic and flexible context-awareness frameworks necessary in ubiquitous computing. Its basic idea is to assign 128 bit unique identifiers, each of which is called a ucode (ubiquitous code), to real-world entities. To guarantee the uniqueness of ucodes, current ucode ownreships are maintained by a hierarchical structure like DNS. In this traditional system, processing ucode transactions between organizations is cumbersome and inefficient because the reliability of owner information is dependent on individual organizations.
   To solve this problem, we designed a ucode ownership management system on a blockchain which is a decentralized platform. In this system, we proposed a blockchain-based ucode allocation method, which requires a simple procedure and only one transaction. This proposed method is user-friendly and efficient compared with ucode allocation methods to which we simply apply current blockchain-based name registration methods requiring a complex procedure and at least two transactions.
   Finally, we conducted a case study about these ucode allocation methods built on the Ethereum blockchain. From this result, we compared the usability and security of each ucode allocation method in Ethereum.

The purpose of the study is to establish and recommend a mechanism for improving the technology of territorial communities management on the example of Family Homesteads (FH). The research methodology is based on structured interviews and unstructured conversations with the inhabitants of family homesteads, the leadership of local self-government and experts in the field of rural development. The self-organization of settlements illustrates them as harmonious communities and a model of the society of the future, practicing sustainable development. It was determined that success in the development of rural areas by settlers of a new type is due to their age characteristics (average settler age 35 years), high level of education, active lifestyle and investment activity. The advantages of the practice of public administration of the territory are established with the help of blockchain technology, which allows to reduce administration costs and promote resource participation.

AB High education system and transitional economy faces with both market and innovation challenges. The appropriate responses to these challenges have to be found under conditions when advanced knowledge is no longer created in universities and research institutions only, but is born in a large number distributed small and medium innovation enterprises as well. This encourages the universities and the businesses to search for new institutional forms for innovating education and educating innovation. One of these forms is the establishment of an entrepreneurial university integrated with startup incubator jointly with business. In this case such university by creation based on smart contracts universal digital platform integrated in GVCs (Global Value Chains) actually turns into a modern innovation hub. In turn, such hub is able not only to incubate the startups and develop them into the new innovation enterprises, but to train innovative entrepreneurs as well.

This comprehensive energy market model LBTF framework can achieve good balance in demand response in two ways. First way is utility-grid contract, which introduced a simple reward policy using distributed proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm in Blockchain to motivate consumer to use less energy in peak hours. Through this policy consensus algorithm reward electric units to the consumers in peak hours. And in second way scheme introduce Micro-grid contract, which is a peer to peer (P2P) trade in global market. Those consumer (prosumer) who can generate energy using renewable resources can sell their surplus energy to other consumer through this contract. Furthermore, hash functions, public key encryption and digital signatures have been used to provide privacy preserving to the consumers and integrity to the stored data.

TI A Low-Overhead Timing Monitoring Technique for Variation-Tolerant
   Near-Threshold Digital Integrated Circuits
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Near-threshold computing brings several times of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency of digital circuits. However, it also introduces several times of deteriorated delay variations caused by process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. In situ timing monitoring-based adaptive techniques can mitigate excessive timing margins caused by PVT variations, but current frequency and/or voltage tuning methods cause large performance loss. In this paper, we propose a low overhead timing error prediction monitor and a super-fast clock stretching circuit to solve this problem. They are both optimized for near-threshold voltage of 0.5 V. When there are timing margins, the frequency will be increased. Until when the timing is intense due to variations, timing monitors will generate a predicted alarm signal. Accordingly, the system clock will be stretched immediately to avoid real timing errors. Applied on a 40-nm CMOS Bitcoin Miner chip, simulation results show that the whole system operating at near-threshold voltage can increase the frequency to up to 2.1x compared with the original non-monitored circuit. Our method can increase the energy efficiency to mitigate near-threshold variations effectively.

The success of IoV highly depends on the robustness of vehicular information system as a dispute among the service providers on data rights or any kind of security violation could disrupt the transport services altogether. In this work we propose a blockchain based novel architecture for vehicle authentication and privacy preservation with seamless access control for IoV. Proposed architecture is decentralized, robust and scalable. Along with privacy preserving authentication and conflict-free access-log maintenance, the proposed BlockAPP protocol also supports an optional traceability feature. Performance evaluation using smart contact over Ethereum Blockchain validates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

AB Smart interconnected vehicles generate a huge amount of data to be used by a wide range of applications. Although cloud based data management is currently in practice, for many applications serving road safety or traffic regulation, it is utmost important that applications access these data at the site itself for improved quality of service. Road side units (RSUs) play a crucial role in handling these vast amount of vehicular data and serving the running applications in turn. In this current era of edge computing, in-place data access is also proven to be advantageous from cost point of view. As multiple applications from different service providers are interested to access different fragments of these data, a robust access control mechanism is needed to ensure desired level of security as well as reliability for these data. In this paper, we introduce B2VDM, a novel architecture for vehicular data management at RSUs, that provides a seamless access control using Blockchain technology. The proposed B2VDM framework also implements a simple load distribution module, which maintains the reliability by minimizing the number of packet drops at a heavily loaded RSU during peak hours. An extensive evaluation using Etherium Blockchain validates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.

AB Optimizing physical goods distribution by providing increased visibility to trading partners can directly impact product cost. However, current supply chain information systems often lack the ability to cost-effectively relay ground truth information in near real time to all stakeholders and most importantly to the supplier and the customer during the transport of the shipment. This paper presents a solution that addresses this gap through a peer-to-peer architecture that can support the increasing demand for visibility and timely delivery of information during the physical distribution phase of supply chain. Additional features of the proposed solution include scalability, privacy and validity of the information that is delivered to the trading partners. The solution enables small, medium and large businesses to interact in a dynamic and shipment-centric manner through a private blockchain sub-ledger that digitizes the transfer of custody chain for each shipment. Information in this private ledger is augmented by a public event ledger that reflects the movement of the shipment in near real time. Third party monitors are engaged in the validation of the geolocation of the shipments by posting their physical proximity in the form of events to the public ledger.

AB In recent years, the increase of multi-pollutant air pollution index has a direct impact on people's health. Relevant studies have pointed out that the exposure of air pollutants has a strong connection with asthma and other unhealthy diseases such as the lungs. The air pollution has brought health issue, but also caused a huge medical costs each year derived from the disease. Although there are many different approaches to forecasting air pollution, most of them are based on historical data and the environment of local server devices. Some of the data records may differ from those of real-time situations and those limitation of traditional hardware devices. Therefore, this project tries to adopt Azure, a cloud computing platform with advantages of scalability, reliability and agility, to set up a multi-pollutant air quality deterioration warning system. This project is divided into three parts. The first part is the collection of multi-pollutant data and the prediction of multi-pollutant air pollution quality. After the government and private data are collected and integrated into the database, the air quality of multi-pollutant are predicted. The second part is big data analysis of air quality indicators for pollutants indicator AQI, AAQI, and HAQI. AIDE, a real-time deterioration warning system for deteriorating, was popularized in Spark for big data analytics framework and various reports were generated. The third part will be a combination of blockchain and perpetual system performance assessment. The overall system will integrate with the blockchain and conduct a continuous evaluation of the system.

TI THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE
   FINANCIAL SYSTEM
SO FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Based on our analysis of trends and threats associated with the use of financial technology, we conclude that its implementation increases the complexity of the institutional structure of the financial system. Certain institutional factors earlier regarded by scholars as anomalies that had either none or an insignificant effect on the development of the financial system are now emerging. These factors are becoming increasingly fundamental, and are in fact transforming the financial system. As the result, the established functional relations fail, while new institutions and new interdependences emerge, which leads to certain unforeseen destabilizing consequences.
   The spontaneity of the process of systemic transformation determines human behavior, that is why it is not always possible to clearly anticipate the outcomes of such transformation.
   Financial innovations are more difficult to regulate because there are no formal rules established for most of them, and they themselves are so novel that they fall outside the control of regulatory authorities. We believe that in order to prevent potentially adverse effects, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation between government agencies and financial technology companies for the purpose of developing formal rules and procedures for ensuring the reliability and the security of the financial sector. It is important to work towards increasing the degree of trust and to establish a culture of innovation which would help the participants of financial markets adapt to the rapidly changing financial environment.

AB Technology advancements nowadays like the Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, Cloud Technology, Mobile Internet, 3/4D printing, etc. have the potential to add significant business value and make daily life more convenient and enriching. Talking about the future of the society with imagination, innovation, inspiration, interaction, interconnection and improvement, this is a new paradigm pushing from the pillars of education that needs to be agreed and adapted to the reality of each environment, preventing breaks and digital divides in access to knowledge and technologies that impoverish citizens and therefore to society. A smart city is an urban development vision to integrate multiple information and communication technology and Internet of Things solutions in a secure fashion to manage a city's assets. The smart education is one of the main segments with biggest impact in the smart environment. To cover this high tech new scenario there is a huge demand of new research, profiles and skills. The future framework for smart digital education, leave permanently redefined from the impact of new technologies, experiences and case studies from a more interconnected perspective. AR is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike VR, which creates a totally artificial environment, AR enhanced by IoT Data uses the existing environment and overlays new information on top of it. This new technology blurs the line between what is real and what is computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell. The present paper aims to present the current state of the art of AR used in smart digital education, the most relevant opportunities and technical limitations as well as the challenges of building AR applications enhanced by the IoT Data and AI features with the risks and rewards. A considerable amount of research has been focused on AR usage in education. However, the educational advantages and related utilities of AR have only recently been explored in detail. Therefore, a review of advantages and challenges reported in research studies on AR technology in education can usefully suggest both best practices and areas in which to invest future research and development, so that this technology may be employed to its maximum capacity. The paper is structured as follows. After a short introduction into the concepts of smart education and AR, Section 2 presents in brief the methodology used. Section 3 discusses converging of the mixed reality technology with the IoT. Section 4 outlines the main findings of the global AR in education market research analysis, where the analysts predict the CAGR growth of more than 82% by 2021. Section 5 outlines the top three trends in AR that impact education in terms of AR textbooks, AR gaming and student-centric smart digital environments. Section 6 is focused on advantages, disadvantages and challenges of using the augmented reality for education. In Conclusions are drawn future research directions.

AB Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies are recently gaining wide adoption since the introduction of Bitcoin, being distributed, authority-free, and secure. Proof of Work (PoW) is at the heart of blockchain's security, asset generation, and maintenance. Although simple and secure, a hash-based PoW like Bitcoin's puzzle is often referred to as "useless", and the used intensive computations are considered "waste" of energy. A myriad of Proof of "something" alternatives have been proposed to mitigate energy consumption; however, they either introduced new security threats and limitations, or the "work" remained far from being really "useful". In this work, we introduce Proof of eXercise (PoX): a sustainable alternative to PoW where an eXercise is a real world matrix-based scientific computation problem. We provide a novel study of the properties of Bitcoin's PoW, the challenges of a more "rational" solution as PoX, and we suggest a comprehensive approach for PoX.

AB Intelligent Cyber-physical systems can be modeled as multi-agent systems with planning capability to impart adaptivity for changing contexts. In such multi-agent systems, the protocol for plan execution must result in the proper completion and ordering of actions in spite of their distributed execution. However, in untrusted scenarios, there is a possibility of agents not respecting the protocol either due to faults or due to malicious reasons thereby resulting in plan failure. In order to prevent such situations, we propose to implement the execution of agents through smart contracts. This points to a generic architecture seamlessly integrating intelligent planning-based CPS and smart-contracts.

AB Voting is an important part of the administration of a country. Votes are still being carried out by physically going to voting booths. This process doesn't guarantee security and cases of tampering has been observed. This paper aims at removing these issues in the voting process by making it online and using the technology, Blockchain. Blockchain uses encryption and hashing to make every vote secure. In this case, one vote is considered as a transaction. A peer to peer network is created to create a private blockchain that share this distributed ledger having voting transaction. The application is designed in such a way so that the intricacies of the underlying architecture is hidden from the user. Each voter is uniquely identified by Government approved Aadhar number. The application makes use of this number to make sure that each voter gets only one chance to vote. When the vote gets submitted as a transaction then all the peers get synch up. Since each peer is associated with a public and private key the votes are encrypted and hashed and added to the blockchain to increase security and form a chain of blocks. Votes cannot be tracked back to the voter. In this paper, a peer to peer network is created having minimum three peers. Since voting is made online, it is expected that this paper will increase the voter turnouts. The scalability of the blockchain application depends on the secondary memory limit of the peer.

AB Is the distributed ledger technology able to predict the capital asset prices and digitizes any financial market participant? Prediction is a scary and tempting place to venture, profitable trading and the development of effective strategies. Will predictions fit into the everyday practice of financial markets? Is blockchain technology capable to revolutionize predictions? Is the blockchain able to compensate of the lack of individual intelligence in assessing market prospects? In the article, the authors do not so much raise these questions as they try to outline the directions for their solution. Financial inclusion is one of the problems that blockchain technology can solve, if it is applied properly. Transferring predictions to the online mode and providing each market participant with the opportunity to digitize their activities would help introduce new efficient mechanisms to improve performance of financial market practices. The article discusses two aspects of using blockchain technology in finance - forecasting financial markets using "collective knowledge" and digitizing assets of market participants based on blockchain. The article also raises the question of the possibility of using some fundamental physical laws for analyzing the impact of new technologies on the financial markets. An attempt is made to approach the assessment of the prospects of using a number of decentralized applications for financial market predictions and the creation of digital counterparts of market participants. A fundamental lesson from experiments in predicting financial markets and digitizing market participants is that decentralized solutions are still not sufficiently scaled and, as a result, are used by consumers.

AB At present, Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECD-SA) is extensively used because its implementation can be achieved more efficiently with the same security level compared to RSA and Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA). In particular, blockchain and Fast IDentity Online (FIDO), which are attracting attention as key infrastructure technologies to lead the fourth industrial revolution, use ECDSA. However, scalar multiplication, which is the main operation of ECDSA, has been reported to be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that use only a single-trace. Notably, there is no perfectly secure countermeasure against Collision Attack (CA), which is the main form of attack using a single-trace. As the attacks become more and more sophisticated and powerful, such as CA, taking countermeasures against them is required. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new scalar multiplication algorithm called the T_SM method. It is secure against Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and Key Bit-dependent Attack (KBA). In particular, the T_SM method can fully cope with CA. To the best of our knowledge, the T_SM method is the first countermeasure against SPA, CA, and KBA. Although it requires memory for pre-computation tables, it has a computational advantage when we apply it to cryptosystems, such as ECDSA, which use ordinary scalar multiplication based on a fixed point P and random scalar k. The main operation consists of the smallest number of operations compared with existing scalar multiplication algorithms in which P is fixed.

AB Cloud users are striving for minimum provider interference in accessing services from cloud's shared pool of resources due to the dynamic and untrusted nature of cloud, and untrusted, vulnerable and greedy nature of Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Service level agreements (SLA) are a critical aspect in maintaining security, trust and provisioning Quality of Service (QoS) in Cloud. The SLA consists of Service-level goals or the Functional and Non-Functional levels that are officially agreed by the customer and the providers. The SLA lifecycle is costly and time-consuming process. Using Blockchain technology's use-cases with Cloud can solve the trust and security requirements of cloud users as well as make SLAs transparent and open to cloud users for quick service provisioning. In order to analyze the feasibility of using Blockchain technology with Cloud, this paper, comparatively analyze the Security and trust requirements and Non-Functional requirements of Cloud and Blockchain to solve the security and trust requirements of cloud users in cloud. We also propose a secure and self-adaptive Blockchain based framework for cloud. Blockchain being the backbone of this framework, this framework exploits the feasible use cases of the Blockchain to enhance the trust requirement of the third party (Cloud Service provider) in Cloud and maintain trust and security in the Cloud by making data secure and SLA transparent and open to all Cloud users, aiding users to analyze and make spontaneous decisions for using Cloud services.

AB Tremendous amount of research is going on in the field of Intelligent vehicles (IVs)in industries and academics. Although, IV supports a better convenience for the society, but it also suffers from some concerns. Security is the major concern in Intelligent vehicle technology, due to its high exposure to data and information communication. The environment of the IV communication has many security vulnerabilities, which cannot be solved by Traditional Security approaches due to their fixed capabilities. Among security, trust, data accuracy and reliability of communication data in the communication channel are the other issues in IV communication. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer, distributed and decentralized technology which is used by the digital currency Bit-coin, to build trust and reliability and it has capability and is feasible to use Blockchain in IV Communication. In this paper, we propose, Blockchain based crypto Trust point (cTp) mechanism for IV communication. Using cTp in the IVs communication environment can provide IV data security and reliability. cTp mechanism accounts for the legitimate and illegitimate vehicles behavior, and rewarding thereby building trust among the vehicles. We also propose a reward based system using cTp (exchange of some cTp among IVs, during successful communication). We use blockchain technology in the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) for the data management of the cTp. Using ITS, cTp details of every vehicle can be accessed ubiquitously by IVs. We evaluation, our proposal using the intersection use case scenario for intelligent vehicles communication.

Our hypothesis is that such a framework will facilitate easier sharing of information across all participants of a distributed development team, compliance evaluation and early mitigation actions, leading to greater visibility and compliance. Currently, the proof of concept we are working on is focused on sharing and compliance evaluation of the open-source components used in software development.

AB Recently, there is a growing trend towards machine learning models that run on client devices such as smartphones, with constraints such as model size and time. Often, the user data on client devices is considered private and so cannot be uploaded to an external server for processing and running the model. Blockchain provides a new way of sharing data that is secure and decentralized. In this paper, we provide a way to use blockchain to run a machine learning model in a decentralized way using various nodes to compute part of the learning task. We apply our system in a smart home IoT setting to generate user customizations based on user activity prediction for IoT devices. We use distributed association rule mining to generate the rules of user activity from the device logs. We describe the system architecture and simulate the system using Ethereum based tools.

AB With the growing usage of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, many scalability challenges have emerged. A promising scaling solution, exemplified by the Lightning Network, uses a network of bidirectional payment channels that allows fast transactions between two parties. However, routing payments on these networks efficiently is non-trivial, since payments require finding paths with sufficient funds, and channels can become unidirectional over time blocking further transactions through them. Today's payment channel networks exacerbate these problems by attempting to deliver all payments atomically.
   We present the Spider network, a new packet-switched architecture for payment channel networks that addresses these challenges. Spider splits payments into transaction units and transmits them over a period of time across different paths. Spider uses congestion control, in-network scheduling, and imbalance-aware routing to optimize delivery of payments. Our results show that Spider improves the number and volume of successful payments on the network by 10-75% and 10-35% respectively compared to practical state-of-the-art approaches.

AB Authoring, developing, monitoring, and analyzing business processes has required both domain and IT expertise since Business Process Management tools and practices have focused on enterprise applications and not end users. There are trends, however, that can greatly lower the bar for users to author and analyze their own processes. One emerging trend is the attention on blockchains as a shared ledger for parties collaborating on a process. Transaction logs recorded in a standard schema and stored in the open significantly reduces the effort to monitor and apply advanced process analytics. A second trend is the rapid maturity of machine learning algorithms, in particular deep learning models, and their increasing use in enterprise applications. These cognitive technologies can be used to generate views and processes customized for an end user so they can modify them and incorporate best practices learned from other users' processes.

AB Attempts to accurately measure the monetary velocity or related properties of Bitcoin have often attempted to either directly apply definitions from traditional macroeconomic theory or to use specialized metrics relative to the properties of the Blockchain such as bitcoin-days destroyed. In this paper, it is demonstrated that beyond being a useful metric, bitcoin-days destroyed has mathematical properties that allow one to calculate the average dormancy (time since last use in a transaction) of the bitcoins used in transactions over a given time period. In addition, transaction volume and average dormancy are shown to have unexpected significance in helping estimate the average size of the pool of traded bitcoins by virtue of the expression Little's Law, though only under limited conditions.

TI BLOCKCHAIN AS INSTITUTION OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE
SO POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA
AB In the theory of public policy, it is essential to find a fair procedure that could be used to obtain an equitable result in the course of choosing and making public decisions. Blockchain, as a network of distributed registers, is often positioned as a political institution that ensures the fairness of decisions by voting on the basis of a pure procedure. Political theory distinguishes between pure, perfect and imperfect procedural justice. The last two types of procedural justice are based on the criterion of a fair result, which is achieved on the basis of a perfect and imperfect procedure. Pure procedural justice is indifferent to a certain resulting criterion; it can be used to solve any issues. This article analyzes the political ontology of the pure procedural justice of blockchain technology, which relies not on the legal nature of the constitution of interaction in the network, but on the technical and social immediacy of cooperation and joint production. These qualities of pure procedural justice in the blockchain, as shown in the article, are provided by the relevant protocols and create the conditions for maintaining a reputation, forming an autonomous identity and building a special trust regime. An equally fair consensus procedure based on reciprocity and autonomy is also important. The article proves that such an institutional configuration of the blockchain acts as an analog of the political concept of J. Rawls's justice as honesty. The empirical basis of the study is the analysis of cases of using blockchain-voting on the platform "Active citizen" (Moscow).

AB We are now living in the significant era where technologies are advancing very quickly. Among the leading technologies, Internet of Things or IoT in short is standing at the peak of inflated expectation in the Gartner Hype Cycle [1]. The application of IoT has evolved from home appliances in the smart home environment such as smart tv, smart refrigerator, smart door and has grown into smart building, smart city, smart healthcare, smart industry. We could imagine that everything could go online to cut cost, add value to businesses and increase users convenience. The prediction has been made [2] that there will be 50 Billion IoT devices by 2020.
   Along the new revolution there has also been threats that significantly warned us if we didn't take security into account some bad things could happen, such as Mirai botnet [3] attacked dyn DNS server by using vulnerable IoT devices which turned smart devices became exploitable or vulnerable devices and named as the weakness link of the network. At the same time another hype among technology communities of using
   Blockchain Technology to secure the Internet of Things is getting mainstream. Blockchain is not a silver bullet to secure Internet of Things, in this paper we will propose an architecture model of using a Blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric to secure the Internet of Things network in a smart classroom scenario and integrated with The Thing Networks (TTN) cloud server and demonstrates the opportunities and challenges of this concept by taking security properties such as confidentiality, integrity, availability and non-repudiation to evaluate the concept.

AB A blockchain is a decentralized ledger where all transactions are recorded. For having a reliable blockchain and double-spending prevention, we need a decentralized consensus and agreement on a blockchain. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW). It is a cryptographic puzzle that is difficult to solve but easy to verify. However, because of significant latency of proof-of-work for transactions confirmation, this consensus mechanism is vulnerable against double-spending. On the other hand, PoW consumes a significant amount of energy that by growing the network, it becomes a major problematic of this consensus mechanism. In this paper, we introduce an alternative to PoW, because of all its major problems and security issues that may lead to collapsing decentralization of the blockchain, while a full decentralized system is the main purpose of using blockchain technology. The approach we introduce is based on a distributed voting process and called "RDV: Register, Deposit, Vote". Since in RDV algorithm, there is no mining process, so it is appropriate for low-level energy devices and Internet of Things (IoT).

AB Existing client onboarding and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes are typically slow, expensive and often accomplished in-person. Moreover, the current identity management models in practice deprive users from having complete control over their digital identity data. Users' identity attributes are stored on multiple centralized repositories, which often follow inadequate security policies. In this paper, we take advantage of Hyperledger Indy, a public and permissioned distributed ledger technology (DLT), to develop a digital onboarding framework based on the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles. With this framework we take a step towards tackling a number of weaknesses in current KYC processes and identity management models, while addressing the requirements associated with SSI, Privacy by Design and European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

The design is based on a hierarchical classification method, with several decision stages. A combination of functional and statistical features is proposed to be applied for data classification in order to provide a high-performance malware recognition process. The specific contribution of this design methodology is the hierarchical classifier with detection and discrimination stages, respectively. Further works should be done for various features sets in order to achieve an optimized and high-accuracy modeling process supporting an innovative Machine Learning-based solution for Android malware detection.

AB The European research project GHOST challenges the traditional cyber security solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector by exploiting novel technologies, such as blockchain, to provide resilience and integrity of decision making on the communication exchange in a smart home context. When it comes to novel cyber security solutions for extremely heterogeneous environments like IoT and smart homes, the key focus is typically given to the understanding of network activities and elimination of suspicious traffic. The GHOST project adds an extra dimension to this approach by integrating blockchain technology at its core decision mechanism. On a daily basis, each GHOST installation is encountering malicious behaviour and suspicious IoT communications, where easy information sharing with other installations, as well as decentralised decision making, are mandatory features for the efficient protection of the end-user. GHOST's Smart Contracts (SC) are designed to tackle in an easy, yet productive way, the reporting on suspicious IP addresses which the IoT devices in a smart home are trying to communicate with. Two variations of blacklisting smart contracts are presented in this paper, covering a diverse spectrum of possible attack vectors while closely following the Privacy by Design (PbD) principles. A reputation scoring scheme for malicious IPs reporting is integrated in the SC, uncovering the implementation details on the penalisation of existing entries in case of malicious behaviour of reporting devices.

AB In recent years, the interest in blockchain has grown exponentially, and nowadays it is foreseen as a technology with the potential to revolutionize the way data is maintained and transferred around the globe. The reason of this excitement is ascribable to the ability of enabling new forms of transactions and interactions between mistrusting and decentralized entities. Indeed, it has attracted interests and huge investments from enterprises, and it is predictable that in a near future many industries will adopt it. However, it is not a panacea and in some cases may even become useless or not convenient. Moreover, even when it can really constitute an added value, selecting the proper blockchain and configuring it may not be trivial. Trying to go beyond the hype and to address this problem, this paper proposes a methodology addressing: i) whether, given a specific problem requirements, the blockchain is a proper solution for it ii) in such a case which is the blockchain category more suitable, and finally iii) guiding the designer throughout its configuration.

AB Large number of stakeholders is interested in data stored in land administration systems (LASs), so it is understandable that data quality in LASs is of utmost importance. Data in LASs are often in incorrect state since they are not in accordance with reality. Since data stored in LASs are considered to be correct in all legal affairs, these incorrectnesses could be a cause for large number of problems. Blockchain technology, more precisely smart contracts, could bring improvements to process of registering transactions in LASs. In this paper, two presented case studies propose improvements that would result in faster process of executing transactions and elimination of possibility of "double spending".

AB Public Blockchains on their own are, by definition, incapable of keeping data private and disclosing it at a later time. Control over the eventual disclosure of private data must be maintained outside a Blockchain by withholding and later publishing encryption keys, for example. We propose the Atomic Information Disclosure (AID) pattern based on threshold encryption that allows a set of key holders to govern the release of data without having access to it. We motivate this pattern with problems that require independently reproduced solutions. By keeping submissions private until a deadline expires, participants are unable to plagiarise and must therefore generate their own solutions which can then be aggregated and analysed to determine a final answer. We outline the importance of a game-theoretically sound incentive scheme, possible attacks, and other future work.

It also introduces the concept of blockchain and its possible applications to collective self-consumption, with a focus on some current experimentations. Current blockchain applications include validation of measured data and energy transactions. New architectures propose a completely decentralized energy market and grid control based on the blockchain technology. However, a deeper analysis of the benefit of blockchain is required. The legal framework will also play a role on the future deployment of these applications.

AB The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) has spurred the research interest in technologies associated with it, for instance batteries, and charging mechanisms. Moreover, the recent advancements in autonomous cars also encourage the enabling technologies to integrate and provide holistic applications. To this end, one key requirement for EVs is to have an efficient, secure, and scalable infrastructure and framework for charging, billing, and auditing. However, the current manual charging systems for EVs may not be applicable to the autonomous cars that demand new, automatic, secure, efficient, and scalable billing and auditing mechanism. Owing to the distributed systems such as blockchain technology, in this paper, we propose a new charging and billing mechanism for electric vehicles that charge their batteries in a charging-on-the-move fashion. To meet the requirements of billing in electric vehicles, we leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), a distributed peer-to-peer technology for micro-transactions. Our proof-of-concept implementation of the billing framework demonstrates the feasibility of such system in electric vehicles. It is also worth noting that the solution can easily be extended to the electric autonomous cars (EAVs).

AB Blockchain based supply chain systems benefit from immutability and auditability properties. We develop and implement a blockchain based supply chain system in Ethereum platform. We find and address several challenges both in system design and performance issues. We focus on system design for transaction validation, information retrieval efficiency and fault-tolerant query mechanism. We describe our implementation details to bypass some of the limitations in Ethereum and smart contracts. We design a smart contract to efficiently organize miners' local data structure for transaction validation and information retrieval. We design Ethereum smart contract that allows transaction validation based on a priori knowledge of product life cycle. Our system achieves constant time latency per query independent of the blockchain length. We also consider supply chain systems with malicious miners that respond with false data upon query. We develop a sampling query and majority voting method accordingly. We evaluate our system's performance in emulated setting and show that even with 30% malicious miners, we still achieve reasonable accuracy in only 0.0723 seconds response time on average.

AB The Bitcoin protocol, based on a peer-to-peer network enables transactions and blocks to be propagated to all the nodes in a decentralized manner. The information is verified and stored across the nodes as a distributed data ledger, the Blockchain. A node can have a maximum of 8 outgoing connections. The selection of outgoing connections are carried out in a random manner and information is broadcasted to these nodes by flooding. Transaction propagation delays in the network results in temporary inconsistencies in the ledger information resulting in blockchain forks. These can lead to possible double spending attacks. This paper addresses the issue of transaction propagation delay in the network. We present a simulation model of Bitcoin network. The effect of varying the number of outgoing connections and its implication in propagation delay is analyzed to determine the optimum limit of outgoing connections. Further, the idea of selection of nodes based on combination of two parameters, proximity to the sending node and random selection and its effect on transaction propagation delay is explored. Simulation results prove that this method further decreases transaction propagation delay.

AB Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is an open-source implementation of a distributed ledger platform for running smart contracts in a modular architecture. In this paper, we present a performance model of Hyperledger Fabric v1.0+ using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN). From our detailed model, we can compute the throughput, utilization and mean queue length at each peer and critical processing stages within a peer. To validate our model, we setup an HLF network in our lab and run workload using Hyperledger Caliper. From our analysis results, we find that time to complete the endorsement process is significantly affected by the number of peers and policies such as AND ( ). The performance bottleneck of the ordering service and ledger write can be mitigated using a larger block size, albeit with an increase in latency. For the committing peer, the transaction validation check (using Validation System Chaincode (VSCC)) is a time-consuming step, but its performance impact can be easily mitigated since it can be parallelized. However, its performance is critical, since it absorbs the shock of bursty block arrivals. We also analyze various what-if scenarios, such as peers processing transactions in a pipeline, and multiple endorsers per organization.

AB Similar(1) to the economic system of the resource allocation of market and enterprise, distributed ledger technology may support an institutional form between decentralization and centralization, especially the smart contract that runs on it. The smart contract supports a more flexible, de-intermediary economic contractual relationship potentially. So distributed ledger technology can also be considered as an institutional technology [1]. According to the economic method, regarding the transaction cost as the basic unit, based on the technical and business characteristics of the distributed ledger, we analyzed economic contract innovation scenarios of distributed ledgers, and found important institutional features, including de-intermediation, intelligence and miniaturization. In addition, we made a preliminary empirical analysis through decentralized exchanges.

AB Blockchain is one of the technology innovations for sharing data across organizations through a peer to peer overlay network. Many blockchain-based data sharing applications, such as sharing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) among different Care Delivery Organizations (CDOs), require privacy preserving verification services with dual capabilities. On one hand, the users want to verify the authenticity of EHR data as well as the identity of the signer. On the other hand, the signer wants to keep his real identity private such that others cannot trace and infer his identity information. However, typical blockchain systems that use pseudonyms as public keys, such as Bitcoin's blockchain, cannot support such privacy-preserving verification. In such systems, it is hard to verify the authenticity of signer's identity, and adversaries or curious parties can guess the real identity from the series of statements and actions taken with a specific pseudonym through inference attacks, such as by transaction graph analysis. In this paper, we propose a decentralized attribute-based signature scheme for healthcare blockchain, which provides efficient privacy-preserving verification of authenticity of EHR data and signer's identity. We also describe a holistic on-chain and off-chain collaborative storage system for efficient storage and verification EHR data. The analysis and experiments show that our scheme is effective and deployable.

AB Information hollering through electronic links occurs across organizational boundaries with interagency that allow automatic exchange of electronic data between partners in the supply chain. In digital data networks are usually sent by copying them from one place to another, one of the main problems in this case is to verify that the information received from the network is genuine and latest. Blockchain technology is considered to solve the data verification in the data authenticity problem independently, without having to take regardless of who or where the data came from. The application of blockchain fits perfectly with the digital supply chain as it leverages Internet technology as a system that connects all organizations involved in the supply chain. Blockchain consists of a set of data consisting of a chain of data packets where each block consists of several transactions in each block can be validated using cryptographic means, cryptography itself consists of two kinds of cryptographic symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. In this paper the application of blockchain uses cryptographic symmetric with Rijndael 256 algorithm which is famous for its easy resistance, speed and design. the results of discussions using technology and blockchain on the digital supply chain is still a concept of application. From the concepts, the researcher concludes the application of blockchain technology with the data structure can be applied by sharing encryption and can be applied in some cases, such as data verification for face recognition, artificial intelligence or machine learning.

The architecture supports the human-in-the-loop paradigm for health research by establishing trust between participants, including human researchers and Al systems, by making all data transformations transparent and verifiable by all participants. We define the trustworthiness of the system and provide an analysis of the architecture in terms of trust requirements. We then evaluate our architecture by analyzing its resiliency to common security threats and through an experimental realization.

We examined the feasibility of a traceable food supply chain through experiments. We investigated the feasibility of a traceable food supply chain through experiments. We aimed to construct a system by which Blockchain technology can realize a highly reliable data management system even without a third party agency. We invent "Proof of Proof" (PoP) concept which is a security-enhanced Block chain technology concept based on the cooperation of multiple Blockchains. In this research, the data integrity of private type Blockchains was secured by mutual cooperation of plural Blockchains. By using our PoP, We developed a sufficiently fast Blockchain system that can prove food safety and food brand. In the future, we are convinced that it is possible to realize the next generation food supply chain that can prove food safety and food brand on an automated farm.

SO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: PLATFORMS, TOOLS AND USE CASES
SE Advances in Computers
AB This chapter discusses Blockchain distributed ledgers in the context of public and private Blockchains, enterprise Blockchain deployments, and the role of Blockchains in next-generation artificial intelligence systems, notably deep learning Blockchains. Blockchain technology is a software protocol for the secure transfer of unique instances of value (e.g., money, property, contracts, and identity credentials) via the Internet without requiring a third-party intermediary such as a bank or government. Public Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are trustless (human counterparties and intermediaries do not need to be trusted, just the software) and permissionless (open use), whereas private Blockchains are trusted and permissioned. Enterprise Blockchains are private (trusted, not trustless) immutable decentralized ledgers, with varying methods of reaching consensus (validating and recording transactions). Four enterprise systems are examined: R3's Corda, Ethereum Quorum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Ripple. New business analytics and data science methods are needed such as next-generation artificial intelligence solutions in the form of deep learning algorithms together with Blockchains. The hidden benefit of Blockchain for data analytics is its role in creating "clean data": validated, trustable, interoperable, and standardized data. Business Blockchains may develop across industry supply chains with shared business logic and processes, and shared financial ledgers. Payment channels and smart contract asset pledging may allow net settlement across supply chains and reduce debt and working capital obligations. Specific use cases are considered in global automotive supply chains, healthcare, digital identity credentialing, higher education, digital collectibles (CryptoKitties), and asset tokens (Primalbase).

AB Enabling keyword search directly over the data stored on the blockchain is a desirable technique that can help in the effective utilization of the data while preserving the privacy. Searchable Encryption (SE) is a well-known technique that allows search queries over the encrypted Cloud data, however, existing solutions are based on the assumption of the Cloud Server being "trusted-but-curious" or "honest-but-curious". This leads to a compelling case to use permissioned blockchain technology to ensure greater levels of security when the Cloud Server is malicious. The amalgamation of SE and permissioned blockchain empowers a client to place complete trust on the Cloud Server and the services it has to offer. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving framework to facilitate keyword search over encrypted data stored on the blockchain network. The framework for the first time studies SE over a permissioned blockchain network i.e., Hyperledger-Fabric. The SE scheme is privacy-preserving as it is based on probabilistic trapdoors. As a result the framework guarantees prominent security and privacy gains.

AB SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). It has a one way compression function using the Davies-Meyer structure from a (classified) specialized block cipher. SHA-2 is utilized in secured network communications, blockchain applications etc. The mining ware of crypto currency also applies SHA-2 today. To enhance the hash rate computation power, the type of processor is changed from CPU to GPU and ASIC for different currencies. But, the issues are too much energy consumption and heavy heat from processing units. This paper's approach to enhance the hash rate computation is with higher efficiency computer resource management by L3 cache. SHA 2 application generates hash block continuously and store the block in to nearest register or cache memory. But multiple thread process configuration might create instruction stall by cache miss. We implemented L3 cache layer in the code of SHA 2 mining ware and designed higher Thread level Parallelism (TLP) inside. The result shows 531.54% higher than original mining ware program.

TI Learning to Classify Blockchain Peers According to Their Behavior
   Sequences
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technologies have the potential to establish novel financial service infrastructures and reshape numerous fields. A blockchain is essentially a distributed ledger maintained by a set of peers (i.e., trading nodes) that do not fully trust each other. A key challenge that blockchain faces is to precisely classify the blockchain peers into categories with respect to their behavior patterns, which will not only enable deeper insights into the blockchain network but also facilitate more effective maintenance of the various peers (in private chains). In this paper, we introduce and formulate the problem of behavior pattern classification in blockchain networks and propose a novel deep-learning-based method, termed PeerClassifier , to address the problem. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formally define the problem of peer behavior classification in blockchain networks. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that PeerClassifier is significantly more effective than the existing conventional methods.

AB Most cryptocurrency systems mint new coins according to a pre-determined rate, which contributes to inflation instead of solely by the actual demand. On the other hand, the blockchain, or whatever distributed consensus protocol underlying the cryptocurrency, can only process a limited number of transactions in a given time interval. To address both of these two issues, we propose a methodology that connects the coin minting with the prosperity of a cryptocurrency. Specifically, when there are fewer transactions, any cryptocurrency adopting our methodology will introduce a greater inflation to motivate transactions. Moreover, this methodology provides deflations and turns the currency towards a reserve of value when the network burden is too heavy.

AB With the development of mobile computing technology, there has higher demand for computation resource in mobile applications than before. Fog computing has emerged as a promising infrastructure to provide elastic resources at the proximity of mobile users. Mobile users can offload some computations from the mobile devices to the nearby Fog servers so as to release the workloads of mobile devices, and therefore improve mobile users' quality of experience. However, mobile users may mistakenly offload their computations to the nearby Fog servers which have been injected by some attackers, and therefore induce some privacy and security issues. As most of mobile devices have natural mobility feature, it is very necessary to check the veracity of a Fog server in a very short time before doing computation offloading. In view of this challenge, we bring blockchain technique into Fog environment so as to verify each Fog server's authenticity and propose a blockchain-based offloading approach in this paper. Concretely, the proposed approach constantly maintains a set of candidate authorized Fog servers by leveraging blockchain technology, and the offloading decision could be made in a real-time fashion. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated our method's feasibility and efficiency.

The security of this P2P network is vital for the currency to function and subversion of the underlying network can lead to attacks on bitcoin users including theft of bitcoins, manipulation of the mining process and denial of service (DoS). As part of this paper the network protocol and bitcoin core software are analysed, with three bitcoin message exchanges (the connection handshake, GETHEADERS/HEADERS and MEMPOOL/INV) found to be potentially vulnerable to spoofing and use in distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Possible solutions to the identified weaknesses and vulnerabilities are evaluated, such as the introduction of random nonces into network messages exchanges.

TI CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE USE OF CREDIT RESOURCES AND INVESTMENT NEEDS
   IN RUSSIAN REPRODUCTION
SO AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
AB Nowadays, innovative development becomes a crucial component of socioeconomic transformation. However, the Russian lending structure contradicts the interests of innovative development, although it reflects the needs of major segments of the national economy. The main objective of this research is to determine the possible options of banking sector modernization offered by modern technologies allowing to solve the accumulated contradictions between reproductive investment needs and lending practices. Analytical and theoretical results of our study have shown that the banking system does not meet the requirements of expanded reproduction and needs a significant change. The obtained results can be used to develop new technological bases of investment banking in the context of modern social and economic transformation.

AB Businesses and organizations have for long been trying to tackle the most prominent issues regarding identity management and systems. Traditionally, the proof of trust concerning the identification of a citizen, a customer or a participant in any business or transaction consisted always in a physical evidence (e.g., a signature, fingerprint, photo or other) whose value would rely on a trusted third-party such as a notary or attorney that confirmed the veracity of that physical evidence. More recent approaches include novel types of evidence such as digital certificates, but still these have no value unless they are issued and signed by a trusted centralized third-party that confirms the authenticity of the certificate. These are then often used by businesses to identify and trace their parties and stakeholders, in a process known as "Know Your Customer" (KYC). This process is often slow and requires costly human intervention. This paper presents WalliD, a decentralized approach of a secure protocol to handle customer identification using Blockchain. The paper then shows a proof of concept workflow implementation of this protocol developed using an Ethereum Wallet.

AB Conventional Key Management Protocols establish secure communication channels by using asymmetric cryptography based on "fixed" public keys. In the Internet of Things context, it is preferable to have a good level of freshness of the cryptographic material. But efficient solutions leveraging "ephemeral" public keys are not available yet. The work presented herein solves this problem by conceiving a novel key agreement methodology integrating the Blockchain technology. Specifically, Blockchain is used to store X.509 certificates related to the initial fixed public keys of devices, to publish new ephemeral public keys, and to help the verification of the authenticity of ephemeral public keys without sending signatures and additional X.509 certificates. A preliminary comparison against Transport Layer Security protocol and other customized key agreement schema presented in the literature demonstrates that the proposed approach registers low communication overhead, limited energy consumptions, and acceptable communication latencies while ensuring the lowest memory footprint.

AB This article is focused on central banks' responses to virtual currencies. The view about virtual currencies is different in separate regions. Even in the same country we can see not similar opinions about cryptocurrencies among different authorities. The empirical research on virtual currencies disclosed that we do not have strict rules in central banking and that this aspect creates more risks in financial system. There are central banks which prohibit financial market participants to participate in activities associated with virtual currencies while others are considering their own virtual currency or thinking about virtual currencies in foreign reserves portfolio. The bank of Lithuania plans this year to issue a digital collector coin using blockchain or other equivalent technologies. So we can see very different central banks positions all over the world. After analyzing central banks positions in various regions the conclusion can be made that in some cases national banks can face even political pressure because of financial innovations.

AB Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) show many potential benefits to the way we travel today. The security requirements to be matched in this kind of systems are challenging and they show technical, societal, legal, and economical concerns (e.g. anonymity, accountability, non-repudiation). To address security, standardization bodies (IEEE 1609.2, ETSI) and harmonization efforts (Car2Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC)) have proposed a Certification Authority-based (CA-based) Vehicular Public Key Infrastructure (VPKI) which still suffers of Single Point of Failure (SPoF) locate in CAs and does not provide transparency in the certificate issuance.
   We propose IOTA-VPKI, a Distributed Ledger Technology based (DLT-based) VPKI that improve the state-of-the-art eliminating SPoF with seamless scalability with respect to the users. IOTA-VPKI also guarantees transparency in the issuance of certificates as well as historical proof-of-possession by storing signed and hashed certificates on the IOTA ledger to facilitate verification procedure. The use of IOTA DLT assure also the feasible deploy in Internet of Things (IoT) domain, where the devices involved have limited computational resources. The effectiveness of our DLT-based VPKI will be measured in testbed for EU Horizon 2020-funded AUTOmated driving Progressed by Internet Of Things (AUTOPILOT) project.

AB To address the need for trusted information across bulk power systems, our paper proposes a new type of distributed ledger (or Blockchain), for a shared management of sensitive information in power systems. We call our Blockchain design the Assured Volt Ampere Information Ledger (AVAIL). The AVAIL abstractions fit data needs of prototypical grid applications in wide area protection and control, energy management systems, and markets. The contribution of this paper is to draw directly from the distinct requirements of these applications and the valid assumptions about the adversaries, to shape the AVAIL abstractions. AVAIL is unique for the following features: 1) Adversarial model: Our design principles consider an adversarial model where attacks affect physical resources; 2) Non-binary validity: in our setting we allow for a spectrum of validity; 3) Validity enforcement: validity in our setting is governed by physical laws.

AB In this paper we use the blockchain technology to develop a peer to peer energy trade platform without a trusted third party. Our main contribution is a novel distributed double auction mechanism which allows any peer to act as an auctioneer and the blockchain mechanism ensures that a peer behaves lawfully while acting as an auctioneer. Using experimental evaluation we show that (1) the distributed auction converges quickly, (2) it minimizes energy loss due to long transmission, (3) computational overhead due to employing a blockchain is negligible, (4) it is efficient and (5) it can implement trade restrictions imposed by the energy distribution network.

AB Blockchain technology relies on consensus algorithms to resolve conflicts in Byzantine environments. New blockchain algorithms are rapidly designed and implemented without a properly conducted formal analysis and verification. In this paper, we conducted a study on Tendermint which is a proof of-stake consensus algorithm. We verified that the consensus protocol is deadlock-free and is able to reach consensus when at least 2/3 of the network is in agreement. We also proved that a minority set of nodes that compose more than 1/3 of the network is enough to censor the majority of the network and prevent the network from reaching consensus and conclude that the algorithm has some shortcomings on availability.

TI A Traceable Blockchain-Based Access Authentication System With Privacy
   Preservation in VANETs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) is one of the most promising application in the communications of smart vehicles and the smart transportation systems. However, authentication and privacy of users are still two vital issues in VANETs. It is crucial to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting the forged messages while preserving the privacy of vehicles against the tracking attack. Moreover, in the traditional mode, the transactional data storage provides no distributed and decentralized security, so that the third party initiates the dishonest behaviors possibly. In this paper, based on blockchain technique, we propose a traceable and decentralized the Internet of Vehicle system framework for communication among smart vehicles by employing of a secure access authentication scheme between vehicles and RoadSide Units (RSUs). On the one hand, this scheme allows that vehicles employ pseudonyms for Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) communications anonymously in the non-fully trusted environment. On the other hand, the transparency of vehicles in authentication and announcement is preformed efficiently by the blockchain technology. In addition, the transaction information is tamper-resistant that provides the distributed and decentralized property for the different cloud servers. With the help of Certificate Authority (CA) and the RoadSide Units (RSUs), our proposal achieves the conditional privacy to trace the real identity of the malicious vehicle in the anonymous announcements as well. Finally, through the theoretical analysis and simulations, our scheme is able to construct a secure and decentralized system framework of VANETs with accountability and privacy preservation.

AB With the development of cloud computing, a great amount of information is stored on cloud, such as Facebook, Twitter, and so on. Single cloud or company is not reliable enough for permanent information storage. Once the cloud or company is in downtime, users could lost their information. Multiple clouds can store the information with more security. However, in JointCloud environment, it is a big problem for multiple clouds or companies to maintain the common rights of information for each user. In this paper, we propose EtherShare, a blockchain-based application in JointCloud environment. EtherShare enables users to share information with permanent storage and open access. It keeps the rights of users through smart contracts to make consensus between multiple clouds. And this application is open source on Github.

TI NutBaaS: A Blockchain-as-a-Service Platform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain, originated from Bitcoin system, has drawn intense attention from the academic community because of its decentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. In the past decade, the blockchain technology has evolved and became viable for various applications beyond the domain of finance. However, due to the complexity of blockchain technology, it is usually difficult and costly for most developers or teams to build, maintain and monitor a blockchain network that supports their applications. Most common developers or teams are unable to ensure the reliability and security of the blockchain system, which to a certain extent affects the quality of their applications. In this paper, we develop a BaaS platform called NutBaaS, which provides blockchain service over cloud computing environments, such as network deployment and system monitoring, smart contracts analysis and testing. Based on these services, developers can focus on the business code to explore how to apply blockchain technology more appropriately to their business scenarios, without bothering to maintain and monitor the system

AB The blockchain uses a decentralized consensus mechanism to maintain the books in an immutable way, which ensures the blockchain smart contract system highly secure. In existing blockchain systems, all user information is disclosed in the blockchain. However, currently users begin to pay more and more attention to personal privacy, therefore the future blockchain smart contract system needs not only to keep immutability but also to protect user privacy. To achieve this goal, in this paper we propose a Privacy-Protected Blockchain System, where all data is encrypted within a controllable period of time. Although the data is visible from a historical perspective, our design can effectively protect user privacy and against deceivers, making the system more secure and healthy.

TI EverSSDI: blockchain-based framework for verification, authorisation and
   recovery of self-sovereign identity using smart contracts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY
AB In the current identity management process, the problems such as increasing differentiation of digital identities, fragmentation and centralisation of identity information have been exposed. In this paper, a framework, named EverSSDI, using smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain is constructed, which provides a unique identifier to normalise differentiated user identities. A fine-grained authorisation mechanism is designed based on the Hierarchical Deterministic protocol (HD protocol) to solve the fragmentation problem of identity information. Besides, a reliable information verification mechanism is elaborated to enhance the credibility of the digital information. In addition, two novel methods are proposed for identity recovery, one of which is based on Social Networking Services (SNS) authorisation and the other Ethereum Oracles. The final implementation and discussion show that the user has self-sovereign management authority, which enables the user to become the real dominant of his/her identity rather than only a prover of digital identity.

AB As the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G and embedded artificial cloud computing develop, cloud computing is encountering growing challenges such as stringent latency requirements, network bandwidth constraints, etc. Edge computing proposes to bring computing and storage closer to user ends (UEs). Furthermore, mobile edge computing (MEC) aims to combine edge computing and cloud computing to offer better latency and user experience. However, cloud computing exists some inherent weakness, such as data loss and leakage, threats to data privacy, etc. We propose a blockchain-based MEC platform, called BlockMEC, that consists of unknown devices to distribute computing, control, storage, and networking functions to the edge of network without involving any central controllers. The survey paper also summarizes typical MEC concepts and makes comparisons between them and BlockMEC.

AB Considering the Internet-of-Things, the blockchain technology has recently become a major focus of research. One of its major drawbacks is given by the poor performance of blockchain systems subject to heavy load. In particular, systems which use Proof-of-Work as leader election strategy are not suitable for an active participation of IoT devices. We propose a new system architecture which uses the Plasma framework to integrate blockchain technology and fog computing and evaluate the performance of its prototype. The Plasma framework has the advantage to provide a scalable hierarchical design based on sidechains and an off-chain scaling strategy which is agnostic with regard to the architecture of the employed root chain.

AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer distributed cryptocurrency system, that keeps all transaction history in a public ledger known as blockchain. The Bitcoin network is implicitly pseudoanonymous and its nodes are controlled by independent entities making network analysis difficult.
   This calls for the development of a fully controlled testing environment. This paper presents Kriptosare.gen, a dockerized automatized Bitcoin testbed, for deploying full-scale custom Bitcoin networks. The testbed is deployed in a single machine executing four different experiments, each one with different network configuration. We perform a cost analysis to investigate how the resources are related with network parameters and provide experimental data quantifying the amount of computational resources needed to run the different types of simulations. Obtained results demonstrate that it is possible to run the testbed with a configuration similar to a real Bitcoin system.

TI Reportcoin: A Novel Blockchain-Based Incentive Anonymous Reporting
   System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the widespread popularity of Internet-enabled devices, mobile users can request and receive messages anytime and anywhere, which facilitates information feedback for smart city management. However, few people are willing to reflect or report some violations of law and discipline around them, and more people choose to ignore. In general, there are two major reasons for this phenomenon. First, reporting with a real name is highly recommended, but it is difficult to send trusted and reliable reporting messages without revealing the reporter's identity. Second, generally no benefit, users usually lack the motivation to report due to worrying about being retaliated. In this paper, we propose an effective anonymous reporting system called ReportCoin, a novel Blockchain-based incentive anonymous reporting system. ReportCoin guarantees user identity privacy and reporting message reliability throughout the reporting process. On the one hand, ReportCoin allows nondeterministic mobile users to vote the reporting by signing and to send anonymous announcements in the non-fully trusted network. On the other hand, ReportCoin motivates users with incentives to report without worrying about the disclosure of identity information to be retaliated. Meanwhile, account information and transaction records in ReportCoin are open, transparent, and tamper-resistant. The theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that ReportCoin is efficient and practical.

AB Smart home systems provide a safe, comfortable, and convenient living environment for users, whereby users enjoy featured home services supported by the data collected and generated by smart devices in smart home systems. However, existing smart devices lack sufficient protection in terms of data security and privacy, and challenging security and privacy issues inevitably emerge when using these data. This article aims to address these challenging issues by proposing a private blockchain-based access control (PBAC) scheme. PBAC involves employing a private blockchain to provide an unforgeable and auditable foundation for smart home systems, that can thwart illegal data access, and ensure the accuracy, integrity, and timeliness of access records. A detailed security analysis shows that PBAC could preserve data security against various attacks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation to demonstrate that PBAC is feasible and efficient.

TI Internet of Things security and privacy-preserving method through nodes
   differentiation, concrete cluster centers, multi-signature, and
   blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Now, the security and privacy-preserving of Internet of Things are receiving more attention. This article proposes a new method of Internet of Things security and privacy preserving by combining differentiated nodes, precision clustering, RSA, multi-signature, and blockchain. To calculate the node rank value in Internet of Things, the number of nodes' links is taken as the weight of nodes based on PageRank. This method increases the node rank values' difference between nodes. Accurate clustering determines the initial central nodes of k-means based on the differentiated node rank values, which effectively differentiates the active and inactive nodes in Internet of Things and achieve different levels of protection. To ensure data's reusability, we adopt the multi-signature. And considering node's incoming nodes have certain decision on whether data can be transmitted, we filter out two nodes with the highest node rank value from active node's incoming nodes to do 2/3 multi-signature which saves resources. We encrypt and sign the transmitted data with RSA, helping receivers to verify data. Data are transmitted safely through the blockchain. Successful validation indicates successful transmission. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between active and inactive nodes, which increases the difficulty of attackers' attack and effectively protects the security and privacy of Internet of Things nodes and data.

TI Optimization of dynamic data traceability mechanism in Internet of
   Things based on consortium blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Internet of Things is widely used in many fields such as industry, medical care, education, and supply chain. With the participation of multi-authorized entities, a large number of dynamic data will be generated in the basic dimension of time. The operations on these data have to be safe and traceable for use in various forensics and decisions. Therefore, the key point of dynamic data security protection is to reject tampering of unauthorized users and to realize the process in evidence and tracing of the dynamic data operation. In order to find a solution to the problem above, an optimization of dynamic data traceability mechanism based on consortium blockchain is proposed in this article. First, a mathematical model for the security of dynamic data storage has been established, followed by analysis on honest behavior motive of individual node decision-making in group game and distributed node cooperation essence in specific industry background. After that, ownership transition function and the architecture of the dynamic data storage system are optimized; quality and growth characteristics of the system under stochastic state model are analyzed. Result shows that the solution can effectively avoid potential attacks such as tampering and faking under approved accession mode. The mechanism has good application value while ensuring the dynamic data storage security.

TI Predicting altcoin returns using social media
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cryptocurrencies have recently received large media interest. Especially the great fluctuations in price have attracted such attention. Behavioral sciences and related scientific literature provide evidence that there is a close relationship between social media and price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies. This particularly applies to smaller currencies, which can be substantially influenced by references on Twitter. Although these so-called "altcoins" often have smaller trading volumes they sometimes attract large attention on social media. Here, we show that fluctuations in altcoins can be predicted from social media. In order to do this, we collected a dataset containing prices and the social media activity of 181 altcoins in the form of 426,520 tweets over a timeframe of 71 days. The containing public mood was then estimated using sentiment analysis. To predict altcoin returns, we carried out linear regression analyses based on 45 days of data. We showed that short-term returns can be predicted from activity and sentiments on Twitter.

TI Democratizing Authority in the Built Environment
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Operating systems and applications in the built environment have relied upon central authorization and management mechanisms that restrict their scalability, especially with respect to administrative overhead. We propose a new set of primitives encompassing syndication, security, and service execution that unifies the management of applications and services across the built environment, while enabling participants to individually delegate privilege across multiple administrative domains with no loss of security or manageability. We show how to leverage a decentralized authorization syndication platform to extend the design of building operating systems beyond the single administrative domain of a building. The authorization system leveraged is based on blockchain smart contracts to permit decentralized and democratized delegation of authorization without central trust. Upon this, a publish/subscribe syndication tier and a containerized service execution environment are constructed. Combined, these mechanisms solve problems of delegation, federation, device protection and service execution that arise throughout the built environment. We leverage a high-fidelity city-scale emulation to verify the scalability of the authorization tier, and briefly describe a prototypical democratized operating system for the built environment using this foundation. This is an extension of work presented in Ref. [3].

TI Digital evidence and procedural protections: potential of blockchain
   technology
SO RAGION PRATICA
AB Datafication of society and proliferation of cybercrime determine the unique importance of digital evidence in today's criminal proceedings. The integrity of data is crucial for their usability as evidence before the court; the traceability and ex-post verifiability of their lifecyde is necessary for the cross-examination on their validity as evidence. In digital forensics, the term chain of custody refers to a set of tools and practices aimed at guaranteeing the proper treatment of digital evidence and the accurate documentation of all the activities concerning its identification, collection, storage and analysis. The need to verify the correctness of digital evidence's treatment is made more urgent by the diffusion of highly intrusive detection instruments such as trojan horses, and by the increasingly transitional dimension of digital investigations. Therefore, the development of proper recording tools is crucial. The present work discusses how blockchain technologies could be deployed to maintain a transparent and tamperproof register of forensics activities shared among all private and public actors which participate to the digital evidence lifecycle. This instrument would facilitate national and international cooperation in digital investigations, guaranteeing both the integrity of data and the transparency of meta-information concerning their treatment. Ultimately, this would allow to better protect defendants' rights in relation to digital evidence.

   neglect with personality pathology among adolescents referred for mental
   health services
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB The present study investigated the unique association between five types of childhood abuse and neglect and 18 lower-order dimensions of personality pathology, and using latent classes analysis (LCA) explored patterns of childhood abuse or neglect experiences. Further differences across latent classes on personality pathology traits, personality disorder symptom count and a diagnosis of personality disorder were examined. Participants were 178 adolescents and young adults (12-22 years; M = 16.02, 65.7% girls; 83% Axis I/II disorder) from the Netherlands referred for mental health services. Emotional abuse was uniquely associated with 11 personality pathology traits; sexual and physical were associated with three and four traits, respectively. LCA yielded three classes, namely, severe maltreatment (class 1), low-moderate emotional maltreatment and sexual abuse (class 2), and least maltreatment (class 3). After controlling for age, gender, presence of any Axis I disorder, multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that classes with more types of maltreatment experiences and higher severity (classes 1 and 2) endorsed more personality pathology traits, personality disorder symptom counts and a diagnosis of a personality disorder than the least maltreatment class. Findings have theoretical and clinical implications entailing the identification of patterns of maltreatment types and related personality pathology traits among youth.

AB The promise of using blockchain technology in legal transactions is that it will enable smart contracts to self-execute without intermediaries and arbitrators. However, blockchain cannot access data outside of its network, so a smart contract can self-execute on its own only within the blockchain. If the contract requires a delivery of goods or a performance of services in the real world, an external agent must verify the facts and add the information to the blockchain. Blockchain can ensure that the data entered has not been subsequently modified, but it cannot guarantee that it is true. The article analyses the role of blockchain oracles - i.e. third-party services entrusted by the parties with verifying real-world data that can trigger smart contract execution. The need for legal impartiality of such agents is discussed.

Specifically, the model attempts to identify different regimes throughout the history of Bitcoin using the different available Bitcoin network characteristics, such as cost per transaction, number of transactions per block, number of active addresses and number of transactions. Estimation and diagnostic checks are performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In the empirical analysis, we show that our model is able to identify periods of crashes as one of these regimes, which is also a period of declining returns and declining number of active users. We also find that the number of users and the number of transactions determine the magnitude or persistence of a crash period.

TI On Some Approaches to the Solution of the "Useful Proof-of-Work for
   Blockchains" Task
SO AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB The blockchain technology is based on the proof-of-work principles. The essence of this principle is that some event (for example the bill-to-bill money transaction) becomes significant after the confirmation by certain computer work. So, a demand arose for such computational problems to work on, and we will spend for it about the whole blockchain system computing capacity. Now the main class of such problems is a hash-puzzle - the problem to find a bit string with a hash that satisfies some conditions. The major hash-puzzle weakness is the lack of the useful application outside of the blockchain technology. In this work, we offer some approaches to the Useful Proof-of-work for blockchains task, namely, we consider some practical variants of the NP-complete problems (tasks) that could be solved with the help of SAT-solvers as the proof-of-work computational problems. The use of the FPT-problems requires special study. The approach offered allows to provide the following characteristics of the proof-of-work computational problems: usefulness, problems complexity management (through the dimension change, choosing problems of certain type, the indication of necessary solution precision), mass character. Herewith we admit that not every solved task can be useful but we consider the opportunity to solve some practical tasks with the help of the blockchain technology. Among other things it is also possible to compare the virtual crypto-currency value (through the energy costs spent) and the effective result of the practical problems solution. The most complicated points of the described approach are the realization of the events-tasks (providing the computer work for these events) relations and the realization of the tasks complexity analysis system. This issue should be viewed as a research program because of many technical details that must be worked out further.

The results indicate only a causal link going from the Bitcoin price to S&P 500 Index. Consequently, a change in Bitcoin prices appears to influence the investors' decisions on the S&P 500 Index. Therefore, it can be said that the investors in S&P 500 Index have closely followed the new macro-financial developments in the market and have been active on the S&P 500 market. However, the presence of a causality relation between Bitcoin price and other variables cannot be determined. Thus, it is supposed that Bitcoin may exist in association with the commodity market and other global indicators in the future, along with the recognition of the Bitcoin currency by countries, its being accepted as a means of exchange and its increased reliability.

It has been argued that they allow the citizen to check that his vote is actually present in a virtual urn obtained in the blockchain itself, and also to verify that it has not been modified, canceled or illegitimately added by third parties. Actually, however, the current orientation of blockchain-based electronic voting systems to the complete end-to-end public verifiability of voting integrity and the minimization of the technical-operational, control and guarantee roles of public authorities collide with the fundamental requirement of the secrecy of the vote in another re-edition of the dilemma known as "Wahlcomputerproblem", which implies an inevitable trade-off between the secrecy of voting by electronic means and the verifiability of the results by the individual voters.

TI Authorized Function Homomorphic Signature
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Homomorphic signature (HS) is a novel primitive that allows an agency to carry out arbitrary (polynomial time) computation f on the signed data (m) over right arrow and accordingly gain a signature sigma(h) for the computation result f ((m) over right arrow) with respect to f on behalf of the data owner (DO). However, since DO lacks control of the agency's behavior, receivers would believe that DO did authenticate the computation result even if the agency misbehaves and applies a function that the DO does not want. To address the problem above, in this paper we introduce a new primitive called authorized function homomorphic signature (AFHS). In AFHS, the agency has to obtain a confidence key sk(f) from DO in order to evaluate a function f on the data (m) over right arrow and to obtain a signature with which one can check whether the agency acts in accordance with DO's instructions. A black-box construction of AFHS based on HS is given in this paper, and we show that if the underlying primitives are secure, so is our construction under the given security model. Moreover, we provide a somewhat concrete construction that offers stronger security guarantee.

TI A Consensus and Incentive Program for Charging Piles Based on Consortium
   Blockchain
SO CSEE JOURNAL OF POWER AND ENERGY SYSTEMS
AB Charging piles are used for charging electric vehicles and are directly accessible to users in an energy internet entrance, while playing an important role in energy consumption. Currently, each enterprise constructs the center of operation and maintenance of their systems independently, along with their respective APP payment programs. This results in high operating costs, poor user experience, and low utilization rate of the pile, which limits the promotion and popularization of electric vehicles. To overcome this limitation, there is a need for a multi-center, fair, and transparent consortium blockchain, which can conform to the application requirements of a unified payment system and accommodate a range of diverse enterprise charging piles. In this paper, the design for a consensus and incentive program for consortium blockchain is presented. First, the application status of blockchain in an energy internet is described. Then, the logical structure and hierarchical model of the consortium blockchain are analyzed. Next, multicycle accounting and limiting the amount of accounting nodes in each round is presented to ensure the overhead of consensus remain constant. Finally, the accounting incentive mechanism and the bidding encouragement strategy based on "electric beans" are designed.

Investors who want to gain returns from rapid price changes have turned to digital currencies, which is a new asset. In this direction, the possibility of being an alternative to the traditional securities of digital money has begun to be discussed. In the study, it was aimed to determine the cointegration and causality relation between Bitcoin prices and Borsa Istanbul. In this context, Engle-Granger and Gregory-Hansen cointegration tests and Toda-Yamamoto and Hacker-Hatemi-J causality tests were used. Findings show that there is no cointegration relationship between the Bitcoin prices and Borsa Istanbul index value in the medium and long run according to both cointegration tests; just Toda-Yamamoto causality test shows that there is a one-way causality relationship from Borsa Istanbul to the Bitcoin prices.

TI Justice Without Law: Legal Status of Cryptocurrency in a Bankruptcy Case
SO EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA
AB Cryptocurrency is a brand new civil law object and its legal framework is in a formative stage. As of early December 2018, no federal law regulating activities with cryptocurrencies is enacted in Russia. Nevertheless, cryptocurrency issues have already appeared in court cases, in particular in connection with defense of creditors' rights. An emblematic case in this respect is the recent personal bankruptcy trial of Ilia Tsarkov, which was held at the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. The bankruptcy trustee requested to include the bitcoins in possession of the debtor in the bankruptcy estate. The debtor objected to this, his key argument being that legal relations concerning cryptocurrencies (or bitcoins) were not regulated by Russian legislation and even the concept itself was not mentioned in any statute; thus bitcoins could not be legally treated as property. However, the second-instance court agreed with the trustee's arguments and annulled the first-instance court ruling. The main argument was that, if principles of the Russian civil law were applied properly, then bitcoins should be treated as "other property". In addition, the use of the first-instance court's arguments opens the door for infringement of property rights of creditors. The first-instance court's ruling is an obvious illustration of dominant textualism in Russian judiciary. The appellate court's decision, on the other hand, demonstrates that said textualism could be overcome by judiciary actions at least in some circumstances such as defense of creditors' rights. The treatment of cryptocurrency as "other property" by the court is in general agreement with the conception of the Ministry of Finance's draft law "On digital financial assets".

TI A Novel M-ACA-Based Tumor Segmentation and DAPP Feature Extraction with
   PPCSO-PKC-Based MRI Classification
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB In medical image processing, segmentation and classification plays a significant part in prediction of affected region from given input image. The novel segmentation and classification model to segment tumor region and to identify the abnormality category from MR brain image is projected. In preprocessing, image filtering by distribution-based adaptive median filtering technique to prove smoothness to the image and to eliminate the noise component is provided. Further the skull region is removed by using adaptive threshold-based edge detection with canny method. In the segmentation, a novel multiangle cellular automata model to predict the region of interest, i.e., tumor spot is discussed. The classification performance is improved by novel texture extraction and optimal feature selection method named as dynamic angle projection pattern and priority particle cuckoo search optimization, respectively. These optimized features are given to support vector machine (SVM) and pointing kernel classifier (PKC) to classify the abnormality level of segmented image. This work can be compared with existing systems for the parameters of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, FPR, TPR, and ROC. Our proposed classifier PKC's performance is good when compared with other technique. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85.9155, 94.3396, 89.5161, and 95.7746%, 100, and 97.5806% are obtained in SVM and PKC, respectively. SVMs are linear up to 0.8 for higher values of FPR and reaches the stable point prior to the maximum value. But, the stable operation is achieved in proposed PKC at 0.9. Result shows that the improvement in performance of proposed PKC.

TI Blockchain-Based One-Off Address System to Guarantee Transparency and
   Privacy for a Sustainable Donation Environment
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The problem of transparency in donation systems has long been a topic for discussion. However, the emphasis on transparency raises privacy concerns for donors and recipients, with some people attempting to hide donations or the receipt of money. Therefore, a donation system that guarantees transparency and privacy is required to avoid negative side effects. In this study, we developed a system that protects personal information by using a one-time account address system based on a blockchain while emphasizing transparency. The developed system could contribute to the creation of a sustainable and safe donation environment and culture.

TI Blockchain Securities, Insolvency Law and the Sandbox Approach
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB Blockchain is a new technology that is based on an algorithm which allows participants of an IT network to process, store and share data across multiple points without the need for any intermediary, at least in order to ensure the integrity of the data dealt with. This technology is simplifying financial marketsmany organizations are launching initial coin offerings to facilitate the financing of new business ventures; moreover, securities' that are issued in such a digital form can be bought and sold in the secondary market without the intervention of the traditional intermediaries. However, this use of blockchain could give rise to many problems which, in this article, will be analysed from the prospective of insolvency law. This paper will argue: first, that these problems originate from the fact that the issuance of blockchain securities is creating a divide between the world where securities are issued, offered and sold, and the world where law is enforceable; secondly, that these problems cannot be managed easily because of the lack of an apt point of attack, rather than because of the claim that the principle of technological neutrality should be observed; thirdly, thatunder certain conditionsthe sandbox approach that is being adopted by the UK financial conduct authority could contribute to directly shaping the platforms in pursuit of regulatory goals.

TI A contribution to the analysis of the legal status of cryptocurrencies
SO RAGION PRATICA
AB This paper advocates that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum don't challenge the current legal system, since they fit comfortably enough into the immaterial asset legal definition. As such, while a blockchain-based cryptocurrency can't be considered as legal tender or electronic money, it can be exchanged on a contractual basis as it happens with every other kind of good. As per the alleged crime-supporting role of cryptocurrencies by way of the anonymity of the blockchain transactions, this article demonstrates that the anonymity granted herein is not absolute. Therefore it is not correct to claim that this technology has been built, by design, to foster illegal behaviour. This is an important finding because, in the opposite case, there would have been room to affirm the impossibility to use a cryptocurrency as part of an agreement because of its intrinsic illegal nature.

TI Toward Shared Ownership in the Cloud
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB Cloud storage platforms promise a convenient way for users to share files and engage in collaborations, yet they require all files to have a single owner who unilaterally makes access control decisions. Existing clouds are, thus, agnostic to the notion of shared ownership. This can be a significant limitation in much collaboration because, for example, one owner can delete files and revoke access without consulting the other collaborators. In this paper, we first formally define a notion of shared ownership within a file access control model. We then propose two possible instantiations of our proposed shared ownership model. Our first solution, called Commune, relies on secure file dispersal and collusion-resistant secret sharing to ensure that all access grants in the cloud require the support of an agreed threshold of owners. As such, Commune can be used in existing clouds without modifications to the platforms. Our second solution, dubbed Comrade, leverages the blockchain technology in order to reach consensus on access control decision. Unlike Commune, Comrade requires that the cloud is able to translate access control decisions that reach consensus in the blockchain into storage access control rules, thus requiring minor modifications to existing clouds. We analyze the security of our proposals and compare/evaluate their performance through implementations using Amazon S3.

TI Brokerless inter-domain virtual network embedding: A blockchain-based
   approach
SO IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB The blockchain technology enables entities to query and alter information without trusting a middle party while providing a secure data storage in a decentralized manner. In this paper, we focus on an IT data supply chain scenario, where multiple actors negotiate a tenancy agreement for virtualized network resources. This process consists of service providers (SPs) requesting the embedding of specified virtual networks across multiple infrastructure providers (InPs). Since InPs are typically not willing to disclose detailed internal network information, this is a major deal breaker that hampers the efficiency of the service negotiation process. After reviewing the related work on centralized and decentralized virtual network embedding (VNE) approaches, we briefly discuss the reasons for a blockchain approach for this problem. Our approach comprises of a brokerless blockchain based system, that uses smart contracts and a VN partitioning algorithm based on the Vickrey auction model. Finally, we investigate the feasibility of our approach, by first analyzing the behavior of the introduced auction model in adverse conditions and by secondly evaluating the blockchain performance given different consensus protocols.

TI THE COMMODIFICATION OF CRYPTOCURRENCY
SO MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW
AB Cryptocurrencies are digital tokens built on blockchain technology. This allows for a product that is fully decentralized, with no need for a third-party intermediary like a government or financial institution. Cryptocurrency creators use initial coin offerings (ICOs) to raise capital to build their tokens. Cryptocurrency ICOs are problematic because they do not fit neatly within either of two traditional categories-securities or commodities. Each of these categories has their own regulatory agency: the SEC for securities and the CFTC for commodities. At first blush, ICOs seem to be a sale of securities subject to regulation by the SEC, but this is far from clear and creates regulatory difficulties. This is because the Howey test, which determines whether an asset is a security or not, does not cleanly apply to nontraditional assets, like tokens. This Note argues for a revised standard that reconciles Howey with cryptocurrencies. This standard would require cryptocurrency creators to show how essential blockchain technology is to their token if they want to fall beyond the scope of the Howey test, and consequently SEC regulation. This standard would still preserve regulatory protections from fraud, which the CFTC provides for investors, while loosening regulatory restrictions on the cryptocurrencies that leverage blockchain technology most usefully.

TI Branch based blockchain technology in intelligent vehicle
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Intelligent vehicle (IV) is an internet-enabled vehicle, commonly referred to as a self-driving car, which enables vehicles-to-everything communications. This communication environment is not secure and has several vulnerabilities. The major issues in IV communication are trustworthiness, accuracy, and security of received and broadcasted data in the communication channel. In this article, we introduce blockchain technology to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with topologies similar to IV communication. Further, we propose a blockchain-technology-enabled IV communication use case. Blockchain technology is used to build a secure, trusted environment for IV communication. This trusted environment provides a secure, distributed, and decentralized mechanism for communication between IVs, without sharing their personal information in the intelligent transportation system. Our proposed method comprises of a local dynamic blockchain (LDB) and main blockchain, enabled with a secure and unique crypto ID called intelligent vehicle trust point (IVTP). The IVTP ensures trustworthiness among vehicles. Vehicles use and verify the IVTP with the LDB to communicate with other vehicles. For evaluation, we simulated our proposed blockchain technology-based IV communication in a common intersection deadlock use case. The performance of the traditional blockchain is evaluated with emphasis on real-time traffic scenarios. We also introduce LDB branching, along with a branching and un-branching algorithm for automating the branching process for IV communication. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Creation of Trust in the Russian Cryptocurrency Market
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY-EKONOMICHESKAYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
AB A significant increase in the cash value of Bitcoin in the beginning of 2017 led to growth in people's interest in cryptocurrency. The uniqueness of this type of money is that the transaction occurs only with the approval of a network of participants, and the funds themselves are beyond the control of any state. At the same time, the Russian government, represented by the Ministry of Finance, did not approve a cryptocurrency until 2018.
   Despite the large number of studies that reveal the main advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency, as well as the motivation of the participants, the issue of building trust in cryptocurrencies remains relevant. The main goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms of trust building among the participants of the cryptocurrency market.
   The research information base was based on 15 semi-structured interviews with active participants of the cryptocurrency market. Based on collected data, a typology of cryptocurrency users was made, and ways of managing risks in interacting with the market and insight into the role of the state in this market were examined. Cryptocurrency users can be divided into those who use it for consumption of various goods (including those who are prohibited in the territory of the Russian Federation) and those who seek to derive financial benefit from the current market situation. Although both groups exist in the same market, they have different expectations: consumers strive to ensure that the cryptocurrency exchange rate remains stable, whereas the other group hopes for a long period of high exchange-rate volatility to increase their own earnings. The position that the local state should take is an important factor of trust for each of the groups represented.
   Cryptocurrencies are still at an early stage of development. A large group of people on the market is trying to monetize the weaknesses that exist at the moment. Over time, the situation on the cryptocurrency market stabilizes, and it can then move to a qualitatively different stage of development.

TI Decentralized Transaction Mechanism Based on Smart Contract in
   Distributed Data Storage
SO INFORMATION
AB Distributed data storage has received more attention due to its advantages in reliability, availability and scalability, and it brings both opportunities and challenges for distributed data storage transaction. The traditional transaction system of storage resources, which generally runs in a centralized mode, results in high cost, vendor lock-in and single point failure risk. To overcome the above shortcomings, considering the storage policy with erasure coding, in this paper we propose a decentralized transaction method for cloud storage based on a smart contract, which takes into account the resource cost for distributed data storage. First, to guarantee the availability and decrease the storing cost, a reverse Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based auction mechanism is proposed for storage resource selection and transaction. Then we deploy and implement the proposed mechanism by designing a corresponding smart contract. Especially, we address the problem of how to implement a VCG-like mechanism in a blockchain environment. Based on the private chain of Ethereum, we make the simulation for the proposed storage transaction method. The results of simulation show that the proposed transaction model can realize competitive trading of storage resources and ensure the safe and economic operation of resource trading.

To verify this, we first examine how firms can employ distributed ledger technology by adopting blockchain technology to achieve real-time transparency and cost savings. We also review the current blockchain technology applications in the financial industry and supply chains to explain this technology's mechanisms for enabling real-time transparency and cost savings in the manufacturing industry. Finally, we theoretically compare the profits of manufacturing firms in two managerial delegation games under a duopoly situation. This theoretical model suggests that the real-time transparency and cost savings secured by blockchain technology improve the profitability and competitiveness of manufacturing firms, which, in turn, assure the sustainability in the manufacturing industry.

It is obvious that all kinds of activities must be performed continually across all stages of the data life cycle to help support effective data management, in particular, the collection and storage of data, its processing and analysis, refining the physical model, making preparations for publication, and data reprocessing taking refinement into account. In this paper we present a general approach to construction and the architecture of a system to be able to collect, store, and provide users' access to astrophysical data. We also suggest a new approach to the construction of a metadata registry based on the blockchain technology.

SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Bitcoin is the leading cryptocurrency in the world with a total marketcap of nearly USD 33 billion, [1] with 370,000 transactions recorded daily [2]. Pseudo-anonymous, decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash systems such as Bitcoin have caused a paradigm shift in the way that people conduct financial transactions and purchase goods. Although cryptocurrencies enable users to securely and anonymously exchange money, they can also facilitate illegal criminal activities. Therefore, it is imperative that law enforcement agencies develop appropriate analytical processes that will allow them to identify and investigate criminal activities in the Blockchain (a distributed ledger). In this paper, INTERPOL, through the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation, proposes a Bitcoin analytical framework and a software system that will assist law enforcement agencies in the real-time analysis of the Blockchain while providing digital crime analysts with tracing and visualization capabilities. By doing so, it is feasible to render transactions decipherable and comprehensible for law enforcement investigators and prosecutors. The proposed solution is evaluated against three criminal case studies linked to Darknet markets, ransomware and DDoS extortion.

AB Recent years have seen a growing interest among investors in the new technology of blockchain and cryptocurrencies and some early investors in this new type of digital assets have made significant gains. The heuristic algorithm, differential evolution, has been advocated as a powerful tool in portfolio optimization. We propose in this study two new approaches derived from the traditional differential evolution (DE) method: the GARCH-differential evolution (GARCH-DE) and the GARCH-differential evolution t-copula (GARCH-DE-t-copula). We then contrast these two models with DE (benchmark) in single and multi-period optimizations on a portfolio consisting of five cryptoassets under the coherent risk measure CVaR constraint. Our analysis shows that the GARCH-DE-t-copula outperforms the DE and GARCH-DE approaches in both single- and multi-period frameworks. For these notoriously volatile assets, the GARCH-DE-t-copula has shown risk-control ability, hereby confirming the ability of t-copula to capture the dependence structure in the fat tail.

TI How Much Are Insurance Consumers Willing to Pay for Blockchain and Smart
   Contracts? A Contingent Valuation Study
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Blockchain is highly secure in design and can hand huge data efficiently. A smart contract, based on a blockchain, can automate the entire process and make the contract self-executing in nature. Since the first introduction of these technologies in the 1990s, they have been at the center interest for academia and industry. Numerous researchers and practitioners have investigated the principles and usage of blockchain and smart contracts. However, little is coincidental regarding estimating the consumer's additional willingness to pay (WTP) and analyzing the relationship with socio-economic characteristics of the consumer for blockchain and smart contracts in the insurance sector. This study conducted the survey on 1000 heads of the household or homemakers who represent population well in South Korea and estimated additional WTP using one-and-one-half-bounded dichotomous choice contingent valuation (OOHB DC CV) method. About 65% of sample respondents answered they are willing to pay some additional premium for blockchain and smart contracts. The mean WTP has the value of KRW 28,425.43 (USD 25.38) and the median WTP is KRW 16,111.71 (USD 14.39). Those with high incomes, high education and more insurance contracts are more likely to pay extra for insurance policies using blockchain and smart contracts. Considering the total number of households in South Korea, the aggregated additional WTP is about 8 percent of the net income of the insurance industry in fiscal year of 2017. Consequently, strategic development of insurance products using block chains and smart contracts targeting educated consumers with high-income will increase the number of policyholders, which can in turn increase premium revenues.

TI Blockchain Traffic Offence Demerit Points Smart Contracts: Proof of Work
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB In Malaysia, a new regulation of traffic offences demerit points has been over a debate. Therefore, a blockchain model is formulated to solve this issue. It serves a purpose to be a Proof of Work (PoW) of a blockchain system. This model contains application layer and blockchain layer with smart contract inside. The smart contracts act as a conditional filter which follows the regulation rules. It contains three contracts starting from the declaration of each offence's demerit points and fines until the penalties when a certain amount of demerit points is collected, including revocation of driver license. The contracts will be automatically executed when such conditions are fulfilled. A transaction schema is also designed to match the schema of a traffic offence system. This model is deployed in online environment with two servers synced to each other to prove the decentralized characteristic of blockchain. It is developed using NodeJS while preserving JSON format for transaction between server and client. A user interface is also provided as a simulation media where a traffic officer can input offences and send it to blockchain server while public users or the driver itself can check the status of the driver license recorded on the blockchain. Government officer can monitor the records through a dashboard analytics provided which contains graphs and charts based on the records. This interface is used as media to do evaluation which produces satisfying results. The evaluation shows that the smart contracts are executed properly as compared to real regulations.

TI OnionDNS: a seizure-resistant top-level domain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
AB The Domain Name System (DNS) provides the critical service of mapping canonical names to IP addresses. Recognizing this, a number of parties have increasingly attempted to perform domain seizures on targets by having them delisted from DNS. Such operations often occur without providing due process to the owners of these domains, a practice made potentially worse by recent legislative proposals. We address this problem by creating OnionDNS, an anonymous top-level domain and resolution service for the Internet. Our solution relies on the establishment of a hidden service running DNS within Tor and uses a variety of mechanisms to ensure a high-performance architecture with strong integrity guarantees for resolved records. We then present our anonymous domain registrar and detail the protocol for securely transferring the service to another party. Finally, we also conduct both performance and legal analyses to further demonstrate the robustness of this approach. In so doing, we show that the delisting of domains from DNS can be mitigated in an efficient and secure manner.

TI A SURVEY: REWARD DISTRIBUTION MECHANISMS AND WITHHOLDING ATTACKS IN
   BITCOIN POOL MINING
SO MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTING
AB The past three years have seen the rapid increase of Bitcoin difficulty, which has led to a substantial variance in solo mining. As a result, miners tend to join a large open pool to get a more stable reward. Nowadays, mining pools take up over 98% of Bitcoins total computation power. In a sense, this is a manifestation of Bitcoin that tends to be centralized. Thus, researchers have shown an increased interest in pool mining payoff and security. The purpose of this paper is to review and summarize recent research in Bitcoin pool mining system. We first introduce several common reward distribution schemes, and analyze their advantages and disadvantages with some improvement mechanisms; In the second section, to address pool security problems, we examined the practical utility of some existing and potential attack strategies. To study those malicious attack in details, several defense methods are collected. Finally, we make an outlook on Bitcoin future.

TI The Impact of Profit Uncertainty on Miner Decisions in Blockchain
   Systems
SO ELECTRONIC NOTES IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In blockchain systems, miners execute transactions in blocks. Since each block has a limit on the number of transactions, miners usually prioritise transactions by selecting the most profitable ones. However, miners are uncertain about the exact income and the exact cost of executing transactions. Thus, they are not able to make informed decisions of which transactions to select and execute in order to maximise their profits. The main aim of this paper is to investigate the uncertainty that miners perceive about the income and the cost of executing transactions and the impact of this uncertainty on the profit miners can gain. To achieve this aim, we design a simulation model, collect the input data for the model, implement the model and run an experiment on the model. Our simulation results show that the uncertainty miners perceive about the cost of executing transactions has a significant impact on the block profit. On the contrary, our results do not show a significant impact of the income uncertainty on the block profit.

TI The equivalence of Bell's inequality and the Nash inequality in a
   quantum game-theoretic setting
SO PHYSICS LETTERS A
AB The interaction of competing agents is described by classical game theory. It is now well known that this can be extended to the quantum domain, where agents obey the rules of quantum mechanics. This is of emerging interest for exploring quantum foundations, quantum protocols, quantum auctions, quantum cryptography, and the dynamics of quantum cryptocurrency, for example. In this paper, we investigate two-player games in which a strategy pair can exist as a Nash equilibrium when the games obey the rules of quantum mechanics. Using a generalized Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) setting for two-player quantum games, and considering a particular strategy pair, we identify sets of games for which the pair can exist as a Nash equilibrium only when Bell's inequality is violated. We thus determine specific games for which the Nash inequality becomes equivalent to Bell's inequality for the considered strategy pair. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Self-organized cyber physical power system blockchain architecture and
   protocol
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB The state parameters of electrical equipment and power system control parameters are the key data to realize the precise control and cooperative autonomy of a cyber physical power system. The trustworthiness of the data is the primary condition to guarantee the electric power system's safe and reliable operation. In the traditional centralized data acquisition and management architecture, the security and trustworthiness completely depend on the central main server. A small mistake in the main server will result in data loss, which is irreversible and fatal. Blockchain technique combines the dispersed data with mutual backup and retrieval mechanism, which guarantees that the data cannot be tampered with and forged privately. Based on the blockchain technology, this article proposes a novel data trustworthy acquisition model with high credibility, applied to a self-organized cyber physical power system. In order to overcome the long time-consuming process of building traditional blockchains, a new on-demand data transmission routing algorithm with M/M/1/k queuing model is proposed in this article. Different scales of IEEE standard bus systems are employed as experimental examples to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively shorten the time consumption of blockchain construction and realize the data trustworthiness of cyber physical power system.

TI Towards Secure IoT Communication with Smart Contracts in a Blockchain

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is undergoing rapid growth in the IT industry, but, it continues to be associated with several security and privacy concerns as a result of its massive scale, decentralised topology, and resource-constrained devices. Blockchain (BC), a distributed ledger technology used in cryptocurrency has attracted significant attention in the realm of IoT security and privacy. However, adopting BC to IoT is not straightforward in most cases, due to overheads and delays caused by BC operations. In this paper, we apply a BC technology known as Hyperledgder Fabric, to an IoT network. This technology introduces an execute-order technique for transactions that separates the transaction execution from consensus, resulting in increased efficiency. We demonstrate that our proposed IoT-BC architecture is sufficiently secure with regard to fundamental security goals i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, the simulation results are highlighted that shows the performance overheads associated with our approach are as minimal as those associated with the Hyperledger Fabric framework and negligible in terms of security and privacy.

TI Donation Model Development Based on the Methodologies of Blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEM MODELING AND DESIGN
AB In order to solve the problems occurring in the current donation systems, the methodologies of blockchain include decentralized data storage, transaction hash, digital signature, blocks connection within the chain are adopted to the donation model, called blockchain donation model (BDM). In BDM, all donation transactions are recorded in detail and stored permanently; they are not allowed to change, modify, or delete. In addition, donors could indicate the specific groups for donating directly because of the peer-to-peer transmission method. All the information is sealed through the secure mechanism; only donors and donees could decrypt it with their own keys. BDM records transaction flows starting from receiving to spending the donation in detail. BDM is not only a place for listing details of donations but also a secured transaction storage. The blocks are connected together with a strong chain which is maintained by all nodes in the blockchain network. Thus, BDM is a platform dealing with the donation issue under a well secure mechanism, no intermediaries, and a permanent storage.

We found very important to carry out this analysis in order to foresee the potential risks and benefits of the Smart Contracts' application for the professionals in the financial areas in general, by examining the technological base of this new type of contracts, the link with Blockchain technology, its automatic convergence and its legal effects. The adoption of Smart Contracts seems fairly certain due to the spontaneous and practical forms as Smart Contracts allow to articulate the technology with the legal obligations people bound online in a daily basis, and for this reason the Smart Contracts arise as a figure of great importance for Fintech.

We discuss these arguments by relating them to their philosophical roots in libertarian and neoliberal theories, and assess whether Bitcoin can effectively meet these expectations. We conclude that despite its advocates' enthusiasm, there are good reasons to doubt that Bitcoin can fulfill its promises and act as a functioning currency, rather than as a mere speculative asset.

TI A Reliable Data Provenance and Privacy Preservation Architecture for

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND PRIVACY
AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS) including power systems, transportation, industrial control systems, etc. support both advanced control and communications among system components. Frequent data operations could introduce random failures and malicious attacks or even bring down the whole system. The dependency on a central authority increases the risk of single point of failure. To establish an immutable data provenance scheme for CPS, the authors adopt blockchain and propose a decentralized architecture to assure data integrity. In business-driven CPS, end users are required to share their personal information with multiple third parties. To prevent data leakage and preserve user privacy, the authors isolate and feed different information retrieval requests using tokens specifically generated for each type of request. Providing both traceability of data operations, and unlinkability of end user activities, a robust blockchain-based CPS is prototyped. Evaluation indicates the architecture is capable of assured data provenance validation and user privacy preservation at a low overhead.

Current blockchain projects in China are dominated by private or consortium blockchains that have their accessibility firmly controlled; for public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, access is free for all. Not surprisingly, by weakening state control of digital data, public blockchains may neutralise China's decades of efforts in building internet filtering systems. The existing development trajectory of private and consortium blockchains is likely to advance steadfastly, and citizens and companies in China may be required to use state-controlled blockchains.

TI CRIPTOCURRENCY AND MONEY - THE WAY OF INTERACTION
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB The appearance of cryptocurrencies in modern economy raises questions about the nature of this phenomenon. The first question is - if cryptocurrency a new kind of money. It is difficult to answer this question definitely because till recent time the nature of money remained to be a subject of discussion. Now we have a good founded conception, which represents modern understanding of money. It is based on two principles. The first principle is the desire for wealth which exists in any human being, and in the human society as a social community. The second principle is the equality of exchange as a law of economy. Keeping in mind these two principles, we discover that mankind during the whole its history created and used only two kinds of economic operations, which are two kinds of equal exchange: trade and credit. First common economic operation in history was trade, while credit was rather an occasional one. So, money had emerged first from trade. The trade deal was performed by two independent participants. So, the only guaranty of equality of the exchange was the own value of the commodity which was used as money. This is why trade created commodity money, and the best commodities for this task were gold and silver. Credit created a verbal or a written agreement, which was an equivalent of the value of the loan. Commodity money was inconvenient for capitalism, and capitalism created its own money from the agreement between participants of the credit deal. It was possible because capitalism created close economic relations between people. Credit money is in accordance with the requirements of capitalist economy, it performs all necessary functions, it adapts good the influence of progress, and it is convenient for various needs. Modern capitalist economy doesn't need other kinds of money. Accepting this conception, we treat cryptocurrencies as tokens of various kinds, but not as money. In spite of the word "currency" in the name, these financial instruments are not currencies but tokens suitable for transfer money and some other needs. The anonymity of the deals with these instruments, the absence of public control and some other qualities of that kind became the reason of strong demand for cryptocurrencies and of the rise of their price, especially the price of bitcoins. Flight of capital, some other illegal deals, as well, as the possibility of rapid enrichment attracted people to operations with bitcoins but the rise and fall of its price exposed the scale of risks of such operations. Nevertheless, the main merit of cryptocurrencies is the blockchain system. This system can be successfully used in various industries where exists a need for fixing big numbers of items or of operations. This reasons demand from government economic policy to be careful and wise. The state has time to wait until the processes in this sphere will become more clear and stable. The same approach must be implemented to government regulation of ICO as a new method of attracting investments for business projects. The fact that many deals of that kind were used just to take off money from people must not became a reason to ban these deals. Blockchain system, cryptocurrencies and ICO create a new civil financial society with some kind of self-regulation. Such processes are typical for contemporary time, but they don't mean introducing a new kind of money. The digital revolution will create its own way of interaction of these instruments with existing credit money, and the new system will inevitably demand some sort of state regulation.

TI Chain-based big data access control infrastructure
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Technological advancements have brought about the rise of data and other digital assets in our world today. The major problems with data today are its security and management, more importantly access control. These factors when not tackled effectively can lead to many compromises. The blockchain is an effective technology that ensures utmost security, trust, and maximum access control in big data systems. However, almost all the transactions on a blockchain network are stored in the platform. This process reduces the data storage, as the storage of all transactions sometimes creates unnecessary overheads. In this paper, an off-chain-based sovereign blockchain is proposed, where a virtual container is created for parties to transact in. At the end of a transaction, and satisfying each party, the container is destroyed but the results are stored on the sovereign blockchain network. This effectively decreases the amount of data that would have been stored on the network. The effectiveness of our system is compared with other schemes, and we could infer that our proposed system outperforms the already-existing ones.

TI Blockchain: The Introduction and Its Application in Financial Accounting
SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB Blockchain, as a decentralized ledger technology with characteristics of transparent, secure, permanent and immutable, has been applied in many fields such as cryptocurrency, equity financing, and corporate governance. However, the blockchain technology is in the experimental stage and has several problems to be solved including limited data processing capacity, information confidentiality, and regulatory difficulties. This study sheds light on the potential application of blockchain technology in financial accounting and its possible impacts. We argue that in the short run the public blockchain could be used as a platform for firms to voluntarily disclose information. In the long run, the application could effectively reduce errors in disclosure and earnings management, increase the quality of accounting information and mitigate information asymmetry. We also discuss potential impacts that the application will have on independent auditors and financial accountants. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI A Framework for Dark Web Threat Intelligence Analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL CRIME AND FORENSICS
AB This article describes how the Dark Web is usually considered the dark side of the World Wide Web. Cyber criminals usually use specialized tools, e.g. TOR, to access the hidden services inside the Dark Web anonymously. Law enforcement officers have difficulty tracing the identity of these cyber criminals using traditional network investigation techniques that are based on IP addresses. The information available in the Dark Web, which includes BitCoin wallets, email addresses, hyperlinks, images and user behavior profiles, can be used for further analysis, such as a correlation analysis. Present within this artcile is a threat intelligence analysis framework to help analyze the crimes and criminals in the Dark Web and the framework is realized by the implementation of the Dark Web Threat Intelligence Analysis (DWTIA) Platform.

TI VENEZUELA IN THE WORLD OIL MARKET
SO MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
AB In 2017 oil production in Venezuela, a country with very large if not the world largest recoverable oil reserves, declined by 12-13%. In the authors view, the main cause of the decline is subordination of the oil and gas sector to serving the irrational macroeconomic course. The economic and foreign debt policies pursued in the last two decades did not allow Venezuela to take advantage of the opportunities opened by the ongoing transformation of the world oil market. Sanctions imposed by the US in August 2017 against Venezuela's government and the central bank as well as state national oil company PDVSA heavily increased the risk of the nation's bankruptcy. From the position of independent and active player in the world oil market Venezuela is rapidly descending into a passive object of global oil policy. According to some estimates, cumulative foreign obligations of Venezuelan authorities and PDVSA already exceed 190 billion dollars. The bankruptcy of Venezuela seems unavoidable, even though it could be delayed by the current rise in oil prices and benevolent attitudes of the largest creditors. In the situation of deep economic and political crisis the government purged the top management in the oil sector. In order to prevent further production decline the new management announced seemingly relevant policies, including renewed stimulus to foreign investors in oil extraction. However, the overall irrationalism of the current economic policy prevents realization of relevant sectoral measures. Being in the latent default the government announced plans to issue a cryptocurrency petro supported by oil reserves. Petro is seen as a tool to abort widely spread financial speculations and to achieve de-dollarization of national economy. Political opposition qualified the cryptocurrency as a new fraud scheme of selling oil by using prepaid contracts. The US Treasury considers the digital currency emission plans as an extension of credit to the Venezuela's government what may be exposed to US sanctions' risk.

TI A Quantum based Evolutionary Algorithm for Stock Index and Bitcoin Price
   Forecasting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Quantum computing has emerged as a new dimension with various applications in different fields like robotic, cryptography, uncertainty modeling etc. On the other hand, nature inspired techniques are playing vital role in solving complex problems through evolutionary approach. While evolutionary approaches are good to solve stochastic problems in unbounded search space, predicting uncertain and ambiguous problems in real life is of immense importance. With improved forecasting accuracy many unforeseen events can be managed well. In this paper a novel algorithm for Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) prediction by using Quantum concepts is proposed in this paper. Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) is used along with fuzzy logic for prediction of time series data. QEA is applied on interval lengths for finding out optimized lengths of intervals producing best forecasting accuracy. The algorithm is applied for forecasting Taiwan Futures Exchange (TIAFEX) index as well as for Bitcoin crypto currency time series data as a new approach. Model results were compared with many preceding algorithms.

TI LEGAL STATUS OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY IN INDONESIA IN THE ABSENCE OF SPECIFIC
   REGULATIONS
SO INDONESIA LAW REVIEW
AB Given Indonesia's recent legal policy developments regarding cryptocurrency, it is pertinent to ask whether this new investment market, by its overall structural formation, holds any further risks to Indonesia beyond those to individual parties. This paper contends that any effective regulation of this new ecosystem requires adoption of the machinery of more fundamental concepts and a clear direction. Even if the Government's skepticism about soundness of the cryptocurrency markets is fully justified, how best to protect the various parties in the market is a different issue, one which calls for urgent attention from policy makers, legal practitioners, the judiciary and academic researchers. In particular, given the increasing number of startup Indonesian companies that have scrambled for seats in the new market, and the large number of related criminal cases reported in other jurisdictions, often involving hacking or embezzlement, the urgency to study best policy practices cannot be stressed enough. Against this backdrop, this paper analyzes the current legal status of virtual currency, related parties and activities in Indonesia absent direct laws and regulations to protect relevant parties..

AB Upon the fairness, security and flexibility problems of traditional digital rights management, we proposed a blockchain infrastructure service based DRM platform with high-level credit and security, in which we first proposed a Blockchain as a service (BaaS) architecture to decrease the complexity and difficulty of building up a blockchain-based business model, the BaaS infrastructure transparently provides easily-developed user interface to implement all core functions such as genesis block creation, consensus mechanism definition, node initialization and running, wallet management, address management, blockchain explorer et al. Then based on the BaaS infrastructure we proposed a blockchain-based DRM platform with high-level credit and security for Content provider (CP), Service provider (SP) and customers. We designed the blockchain as infrastructure service for DRM business model and provided core content rights information storage in blockchain for tamper-resistant copyrights protection from being misused, and the content consumers can use blockchain-based digital assets for content consumption payment, and the platform can help the content demand side and supply-side trading and the blockchain recorded the trade data as tamper -resistant evidence. Evaluation experiments manifests the proposed scheme is reliable and secure, and provided an efficient methodology for blockchain application business model implementation.

TI THE APPLICATION AND CHALLENGES OF BLOCKCHAIN IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
   DRIVEN BUSINESSES IN CHINA
SO TSINGHUA CHINA LAW REVIEW
AB "Blockchain" is the buzzword of the year, if not the decade. Aside from the role Blockchain plays in cryptocurrency transactions, Blockchain technology has the potential for significant real-world applications. Disruptive Blockchain technology can be applied to intellectual property-driven businesses-fighting piracy, securing supply-chains, and tracking and tracing provenance for example. However, the use of Blockchain in intellectual property driven businesses also raises some questions. For example, how can users be sure the information on Blockchain is completely reliable? How will providers and users cope with possible cross jurisdictional legal issues? Can the integrity of Blockchain based data be guaranteed and how will providers and users handle data protection? Equally, regulatory issues will continue to be of major concern to the implementation of Blockchain. Discussions over these legal issues will, for now, remain to some extent embryonic. However, China is now at the forefront of releasing Blockchain Potential in Intellectual Property, and some initiatives already undertaken in China and elsewhere could potentially set new standards, norms, and legal principles.

TI Generalized Paxos Made Byzantine (and Less Complex)
SO ALGORITHMS
AB One of the most recent members of the Paxos family of protocols is Generalized Paxos. This variant of Paxos has the characteristic that it departs from the original specification of consensus, allowing for a weaker safety condition where different processes can have a different views on a sequence being agreed upon. However, much like the original Paxos counterpart, Generalized Paxos does not have a simple implementation. Furthermore, with the recent practical adoption of Byzantine fault tolerant protocols in the context of blockchain protocols, it is timely and important to understand how Generalized Paxos can be implemented in the Byzantine model. In this paper, we make two main contributions. First, we attempt to provide a simpler description of Generalized Paxos, based on a simpler specification and the pseudocode for a solution that can be readily implemented. Second, we extend the protocol to the Byzantine fault model, and provide the respective correctness proof.

TI The Dependability of Crypto Linked Off-chain File Systems in Backend
   Blockchain Analytics Engine
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORKED AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB This paper presents ways to assure the efficacy of managing crypto links and crypto speed with respect to the dependability of blockchain. The dependability in this work is defined with reference to crypto links in a proportional manner and crypto speed in an inversely proportional manner, respectively. Also, note that dependability is proportional to the cost such that the more the number of crypto links come in place, the higher its cost is. It is a standard and intuitive practice to partition a large output file into smaller pieces at a certain threshold size provided in the blockchain analytics engine (e.g., 250 KB/partition in Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS)/Hadoop). Crypto link is defined by the hash address (i.e., a pointer link) stored in the blockchain for a partition of an output file off from a backend blockchain analytics engine. IPFS manages a crypto link to every partition of a file of interest whereas the proposed crypto link scheme is at a reduced number in order to address the cost and performance issue such that one crypto link to the entire file and the links between partitions within a file are maintained by local chains of links. Crypto speed is defined by the rate of the number of crypto links over the total turnaround time to encrypt all the crypto links (hash addressing) per file. Thus, notice that without loss of generality, the crypto speed increases inverse-linearly along with the number of crypto links. A binomial-based dependability model can be expressed as a rather straightforward function of the total number of partitions and the number of crypto links as proposed in this work. It is demonstrated in this work how the number of crypto links and the crypto speed influence the dependability in a numerical simulation. Also an implementation of an integrated procedure of a blockchain analytics engine is demonstrated along with Hadoop and IPFS modules. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

AB Steve Saxby's prescient founding of CLSR, two hundred issues ago, encouraged and resonated with my own digital visionary thinking and professional activity in the evolving field of ICT and the Law. From Infolex, the UK's first commercially-available computer-assisted legal information retrieval service, and my APPEAL Report (on the admissibility of computer evidence in court and the legal reliability/security of IT systems), via my Forensic Systems Analysis expert methodology, to the nascent CryptoBlockTV, Steve's scholarly foresight in promoting adventurous exploration of 'digilaw' high-ground topics and issues has presented me with opportunities to generate a stream of prescient material, for which I am immensely grateful. And what is beyond prescient today is that the Coming of the Robots is unstoppable. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Age is upon us; RoboJudge has all but already arrived. While many are concerned about defining and developing Machine Ethics, Castell's Second Dictum: "You cannot construct an algorithm that will reliably decide whether or not any algorithm is ethical" reveals that this is a futile exercise. Algorithms are also pivotal to the current mania for Crypto-Algorithmic Blockchain Technology Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), with a 'Crypto Tribe' of Millennials relentlessly raising billions in real money thereby, to the extent that I have dubbed Crypto the Millennials' Rock'n'Roll. The seasoned ICT expert professional however bears in mind that there are as yet no ISO standards for blockchain, and there is far more to creating and delivering a complete quality-assured system than just the blockchain component. Furthermore, the legal status of cryptocurrency, smart contract and distributed ledger technology is not clear or uncontentious - and there is already ICO litigation on foot. Nevertheless, taking my limerick-writing Castell GhostWriteBot's advice, it is perhaps time for my own asset-linked ICO, to launch my CapChere.com concept designed to reboot Capitalism and achieve ubiquitous universal share and wealth ownership. Look out for Castell GhostWriteBot's account (with or without limericks) of how I fared, in the 400th issue of CLSR. (C) 2018 Stephen Castell. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI From chaining blocks to breaking even: A study on the profitability of
   bitcoin mining from 2012 to 2016
SO ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB Bitcoin is a widely-spread payment instrument, but it is doubtful whether the proof-of-work (PoW) nature of the system is financially sustainable on the long term. To assess sustainability, we focus on the bitcoin miners as they play an important role in the proof-of-work consensus mechanism of bitcoin to create trust in the currency. Miners offer their services against a reward while recurring expenses. Our results show that bitcoin mining has become less profitable over time to the extent that profits seem to converge to zero. This is what economic theory predicts for a competitive market that has a single homogenous good. We analyze the actors involved in the bitcoin system as well as the value flows between these actors using the e(3)value methodology. The value flows are quantified using publicly available data about the bitcoin network. However, two important value flows for the miners, namely hardware investments and expenses for electricity power, are not available from public sources. Therefore, we contribute an approach to estimate the installed base of bitcoin hardware equipment over time. Using this estimate, we can calculate the expenses miner should have. At the end of our analysis period, the marginal profit of mining a bitcoin becomes negative, i.e., to a loss for the miners. This loss is caused by the consensus mechanism of the bitcoin protocol, which requires a substantial investment in hardware and significant recurring daily expenses for energy. Therefore, a sustainable crypto currency needs higher payments for miners or more energy efficient algorithms to achieve consensus in a network about the truth of the distributed ledger.

TI A Blockchain Technology Evolution between Business Process Management
   (BPM) and Internet-of-Things (IoT)
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB A Blockchain is considered the main mechanism for Bitcoin concurrency. A Blockchain is known by a public ledger and public transactions stored in a chain. The properties of blockchain demonstrate in decentralization as distribution blocks, stability, anonymity, and auditing. Blockchain can enhance the results of network efficiency and improve the security of network. It also can be applied in several fields like financial and banking services, healthcare systems, and public services. However, the research is still opening at this point. It includes a big number of technical challenges which prevents the wide application of blockchain, for example, scalability problem, privacy leakage, etc. This paper shows a proposed comprehensive study of blockchain technology. It also examines the research efforts in blockchain. It presents a proposed blockchain lifecycle which refers to an evolution and a linked ring between business process management improvement and Internet-of-Things concepts. Then, this paper presents a practical proof of this relationship for smart city. It presents a new algorithm and a proposed blockchain framework for 38 blocks (which recognized as smart-houses). Finally, the future directions are well presented in blockchain field.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB Bitcoin is a successful and interesting example of a global scale peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that integrates many techniques and protocols from cryptography, distributed systems, and databases. The main underlying data structure is blockchain, a scalable fully replicated structure that is shared among all participants and guarantees a consistent view of all user transactions by all participants in the cryptocurrency system. In this tutorial, we discuss the basic protocols used in blockchain, and elaborate on its main advantages and limitations. To overcome these limitations, we provide the necessary distributed systems background in managing large scale fully replicated ledgers, using Byzantine Agreement protocols to solve the consensus problem. Finally, we expound on some of the most recent proposals to design scalable and efficient blockchains. The focus of the tutorial is on the distributed systems and database technical aspects of the recent innovations in blockchains.

TI Towards open data blockchain analytics: a Bitcoin perspective
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB Bitcoin is the first implementation of a technology that has become known as a 'public permissionless' blockchain. Such systems allow public read/ write access to an append-only blockchain database without the need for any mediating central authority. Instead, they guarantee access, security and protocol conformity through an elegant combination of cryptographic assurances and game theoretic economic incentives. Not until the advent of the Bitcoin blockchain has such a trusted, transparent, comprehensive and granular dataset of digital economic behaviours been available for public network analysis. In this article, by translating the cumbersome binary data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain into a high fidelity graph model, we demonstrate through various analyses the often overlooked social and econometric benefits of employing such a novel open data architecture. Specifically, we show: (i) how repeated patterns of transaction behaviours can be revealed to link user activity across the blockchain; (ii) how newly mined bitcoin can be associated to demonstrate individual accumulations of wealth; (iii) through application of the naive quantity theory of money that Bitcoin's disinflationary properties can be revealed and measured; and (iv) how the user community can develop coordinated defences against repeated denial of service attacks on the network. Such public analyses of this open data are exemplary benefits unavailable to the closed data models of the ` private permissioned' distributed ledger architectures currently dominating enterprise-level blockchain development owing to existing issues of scalability, confidentiality and governance.

TI Confidential and efficient asset proof for bitcoin exchanges
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Technological advancements boost the business to play a crucial role in a country's economic success. Cryptography-based currencies, called as cryptocurrencies, are now leading the world's economy. With the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrency exchanges have emerged to support cryptocurrency-related services. Among cryptocurrencies, bitcoin takes the lead and it is widely accepted by the world community. Lots of security issues are arising day by day and the exchange should handle all of of them sensibly. It is necessary that the exchange should be solvent all the time in terms of its assets and liabilities for its survival. For this, periodic settlement of the accounts should be done using appropriate techniques. The information exchange needed for this should be concealed from the adversaries. Cryptography-based techniques with zero-knowledge protocols are suitable for this purpose. Maxwell's proof of liabilities is the first cryptography-based method to verify the user assets. It makes use of binary Merkle hash trees for representing the proof of liabilities. The root node reveals the total assets of the exchange, which will attract the adversaries to execute an attack. Later the Dagher et al scheme, a privacy preserving proof of asset for bitcoin exchanges, was proposed. The scheme works in an interactive manner that requires the collaboration of the exchange and the user. This paper proposes an efficient non-interactive proof of assets for bitcoin exchanges.

TI QoS-Driven Adaptive Trust Service Coordination in the Industrial
   Internet of Things
SO SENSORS
AB The adaptive coordination of trust services can provide highly dependable and personalized solutions for industrial requirements in the service-oriented industrial internet of things (IIoT) architecture to achieve efficient utilization of service resources. Although great progress has been made, trust service coordination still faces challenging problems such as trustless industry service, poor coordination, and quality of service (QoS) personalized demand. In this paper, we propose a QoS-driven and adaptive trust service coordination method to implement Pareto-efficient allocation of limited industrial service resources in the background of the IIoT. First, we established a Pareto-effective and adaptive industrial IoT trust service coordination model and introduced a blockchain-based adaptive trust evaluation mechanism to achieve trust evaluation of industrial services. Then, taking advantage of a large and complex search space for solution efficiency, we introduced and compared multi-objective gray-wolf algorithms with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and dragonfly algorithms. The experimental results showed that by judging and blacklisting malicious raters quickly and accurately, our model can efficiently realize self-adaptive, personalized, and intelligent trust service coordination under the given constraints, improving not only the response time, but also the success rate in coordination.

TI Impulsive and switching load balancing model and stability analysis
SO CURRENT SCIENCE
AB Load imbalance in a distributed system causes low efficiency. Aiming at the dynamics of resource and load running status, we propose an impulsive and switching load balancing model with time delay based on control theory. In order to describe various current states of a node, we construct corresponding subsystems according to the dynamics of a node's resources. The sub-system switching is triggered by an impulsive signal which can decrease the communication overhead among nodes. The model reallocates loads in light of their real-time running statuses, which improves the efficiency of dynamic load balancing. We deduce the sufficient condition for asymptotic stability of the model by using the LyapunovKrasovskii function, and simulation by Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) to verify effectiveness of the model. Experimental results produced by a shared platform based on block chain demonstrate that the proposed model can make the balanced system speedy, which verifies its feasibility.

AB Citrus blast and black pit that became increasingly important bacterial diseases are caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial potential of Bacillus species strains and garlic extracts against two P. syringae isolates (BAT13 and DAPP-PG115). The Bacillus species strains were isolated from symptomless citrus leaves. Under in vitro conditions, 21 Bacillus species strains and garlic extract displayed antibacterial activity against the pathogen. Under greenhouse conditions, antagonistic bacteria, garlic extract, and copper sulfate confirmed their antimicrobial effect on P. syringae and reduced significantly the extend of stem necrosis 10 weeks after inoculation by BAT13 up to 60.55, 56.11, and 45.83%, and by DAPP-PG115 up to 70.83, 62.5, and 46.52%, in respect to relevant treatments. Garlic extract was the most effective treatment in our hands, and it suggests that Allium sativum extract could be used to control and prevent infection by the pathogen.

TI Legal Engineering on the Blockchain: 'Smart Contracts' as Legal Conduct
SO LAW AND CRITIQUE
AB A new legal field is emerging around blockchain platforms and automated transactions. Understanding the relationships between law, legal enforcement, and these technological systems has become critical for scaling blockchain applications. Because 'smart contracts' do not themselves constitute agreements, the first necessary 'legal' development for transacting with these technologies involves linking computational transactions to natural language contracts. Various groups have accordingly begun building libraries of machine readable transaction modules that correspond to natural language contracting elements. In doing so, they are creating the building blocks for ever more complex transactions that will ultimately define the entire envelope of computational legal conduct in these environments, and likely standardise the field. However, also critical to emerging blockchain 'legalities', is the capacity for dispute resolution and legal enforcement. Beyond the performance of parties, or the quality of goods and services transacted, new mechanisms are also needed to address the performance of the computational transaction systems themselves. Such mechanisms are necessary to address the reality that smart contracts cannot be forced to perform actions beyond the parameters of their coding, even by a judicial order. Legal tools, both technological and institutional, are thus being developed to 'soften' the effects of self-executing transactions. In this article we treat these developments as law-making practices that are constitutive of an emerging legal field. Legal engineering exercises of this kind are not novel, and by drawing on historic examples from the common law and international arbitration, we gain insights into the competitive dynamics likely to be shaping legal engagements on the blockchain.

Working to realize digital innovation through co-creation with customers, we have found out that issues exist that are particular to digital innovation. To resolve these issues, Fujitsu has started working to deploy standardized business components that implement business know-how acquired through co-creation with customers, and design patterns created by combining such components on a platform built by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as loT and Al and the latest open-source software (OSS) such as Hyperledger Fabric, an implementation of blockchain, in the form of cloud services. Incorporated into this is the business expertise we have accumulated through co-creation with customers. By using these design patterns, the creation of solutions that accelerate digital innovation by customers can be realized in short periods of time and at low cost.

TI Blockchain Control
SO LAW AND CRITIQUE
AB Blockchain technology is often discussed and theorized in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Its quality as a technology that produces advanced encryption keys between objects, however, also makes it interesting to those who seek to connect physical objects to digital elements. The reason for this is that the link between objects needs to be 'secure' from undesired external interference. In relation to such interests, blockchain has been identified as a highly attractive technology to support the general digitalization of society towards the Internet of Things, smart cities etc. In extension, the implementation of blockchain technology implies that it may work as a tool that has the capacity to direct which objects may/may not interact with each other. The 'ledger of everything' that blockchain may possibly produce as regards the 'Internet of Everything' is even suggested to make humans and other intermediary technologies redundant. In this essay, I argue that in order to sustain legal critique when the world moves into the next era of digitalization, we need to understand - and question - how technological control operates through e.g. blockchain technology by locking physical and digital elements to each other.

TI No Gods, No Masters, No Coders? The Future of Sovereignty in a
   Blockchain World
SO LAW AND CRITIQUE
AB The building of the blockchain is predicted to harken the end of the contemporary sovereign order. Some go further to claim that as a powerful decentering technology, blockchain contests the continued functioning of world capitalism. Are such claims merited? In this paper we consider sovereignty and blockchain technology theoretically, posing possible futures for sovereignty in a blockchain world. These possibilities include various forms of individual, popular, technological, corporate, and techno-totalitarian state sovereignty. We identify seven structural tendencies of blockchain technology and give examples as to how these have manifested in the construction of new forms of sovereignty. We conclude that the future of sovereignty in a blockchain world will be articulated in the conjuncture of social struggle and technological agency and we call for a stronger alliance between technologists and democrats.

TI An Algorithm that Prevents SPAM Attacks using Blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB There are many systems and methods for preventing spam attacks. However, at present there is no specific tried-and-true method for preventing such attacks. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, "SAGA(BC)" to prevent spam attacks using a blockchain technique and demonstrate its effectiveness by a simulation experiment. A person who sends an email using the "SAGA(BC)" must pay the processing cost with cryptocurrency. If an e-mail sent using this algorithm is received normally at a destination e-mail account, this fee is refunded. However, a lot of spam e-mails are not received normally, because addresses of the spam e-mails are indiscriminate. If a spammer sends spam using the "SAGA(BC)," he/she will lose the cryptocurrency fee for each such message. Thus, if using the " SAGA(BC)" to send e-mail becomes a standard practice for the general public, receiving e-mail servers and/or mailers will be able to easily judge incoming messages without using the "SAGA(BC)," because spammers cannot use the " SAGA(BC)" without losing their cryptocurrency.

TI A RESEARCH ON ENTREPRENEURAL LEVEL OF SOCIAL MEDIA USERS ON BITCOIN AND
   CRYPTO CURRENCIES
SO TURKISH ONLINE JOURNAL OF DESIGN ART AND COMMUNICATION
AB Thanks to the new global order established after the Second World War and the communication networks that have become widespread. Due to this, the electronic payment systems that have started to be used since the second half of the 20th century in the world and the credit cards called plastic money have started to be widely used in our country since the 80 '. From the beginning of 2000's, it is observed that cash-based transactions are lagging e-money-based transactions. Since the beginning of the 90's the Internet and social media emerged with new media technologies and after 2004, it has become a dominant idea that these environments provide freedom and even create disorder. In the last 5-6 years we have seen the trade of crypto currencies like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a method of payment that people use for their purchases based on mutual trust, without an authority issuing it. It works independently of the state authority and the banking system. From this point of view, it is seen as the reflection of freedom originally envisaged for the internet environment. In this context, the question of how bitcoin systems are perceived, and the level of entrepreneurship are issues that needs to be investigated. In this study, a survey was conducted to measure the level of entrepreneurship of bitcoin miners, buyers and sellers. Twitter users were selected for the sample. The research is designed to examine the impact of entrepreneurship motivated by investors' interest in entering the arena that is said to be quite new and risky, and which sub-factors may dominate, which deals with bitcoin and similar crypto currencies. The findings show that users who are interested in mining, buying-selling and trading have very high level of entrepreneurial points.

TI Generating Synthetic Bitcoin Transactions and Predicting Market Price
   Movement via Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Modeling
SO JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION
AB In this paper, we present a novel method to predict Bitcoin price movement utilizing inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and agent-based modeling (ABM). Our approach consists of predicting the price through reproducing synthetic yet realistic behaviors of rational agents in a simulated market, instead of estimating relationships between the price and price-related factors. IRL provides a systematic way to find the behavioral rules of each agent from Blockchain data by framing the trading behavior estimation as a problem of recovering motivations from observed behavior and generating rules consistent with these motivations. Once the rules are recovered, an agent-based model creates hypothetical interactions between the recovered behavioral rules, discovering equilibrium prices as emergent features through matching the supply and demand of Bitcoin. One distinct aspect of our approach with ABM is that while conventional approaches manually design individual rules, our agents' rules are channeled from IRL. Our experimental results show that the proposed method can predict short-term market price while outlining overall market trend.

AB Electronic monies such as Bitcoin and mobile money have become popular in recent times. However, unlike with bitcoin, attempts to classify M-Pesa theoretically have been rare. This article classifies M-Pesa as a privately issued inside money, which evolved as an entrepreneurial response to the lack of traditional monies. It describes the institutional framework within which M-Pesa and other monies evolved while highlighting how competitive forces led to mutual acceptance of competing inside monies, lower prices as well as greater choice for consumers. The case of M-Pesa and other electronic monies illustrates the potential even today for entrepreneurial and market processes in money given the right institutional setting, especially in developing countries.

TI A Simple Spectral Observer
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS
AB The principal aim of a spectral observer is twofold: the reconstruction of a signal of time via state estimation and the decomposition of such a signal into the frequencies that make it up. A spectral observer can be catalogued as an online algorithm for time-frequency analysis because is a method that can compute on the fly the Fourier Transform (FT) of a signal, without having the entire signal available from the start. In this regard, this paper presents a novel spectral observer with an adjustable constant gain for reconstructing a given signal by means of the recursive identification of the coefficients of a Fourier series. The reconstruction or estimation of a signal in the context of this work means to find the coefficients of a linear combination of sines a cosines that fits a signal such that it can be reproduced. The design procedure of the spectral observer is presented along with the following applications: (1) the reconstruction of a simple periodical signal, (2) the approximation of both a square and a triangular signal, (3) the edge detection in signals by using the Fourier coefficients, (4) the fitting of the historical Bitcoin market data from 1 December 2014 to 8 January 2018 and (5) the estimation of a input force acting upon a Duffing oscillator. To round out this paper, we present a detailed discussion about the results of the applications as well as a comparative analysis of the proposed spectral observer vis-a-vis the Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), which is a well-known method for time-frequency analysis.

TI Cryptographic hashing using chaotic hydrodynamics
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF
   AMERICA
AB Fluids may store and manipulate information, enabling complex applications ranging from digital logic gates to algorithmic self-assembly. While controllable hydrodynamic chaos has previously been observed in viscous fluids and harnessed for efficient mixing, its application to the manipulation of digital information has been sparsely investigated. We show that chaotic stirring of a viscous fluid naturally produces a characteristic signature of the stirring process in the arrangement of particles in the fluid, and that this signature directly satisfies the requirements for a cryptographic hash function. This includes strong divergence between similar stirring protocols' hashes and avoidance of collisions (identical hashes from distinct stirs), which are facilitated by noninvertibility and a broad chaotic attractor that samples many points in the fluid domain. The hashing ability of the chaotic fluidic map implicates several unexpected mechanisms, including incomplete mixing at short time scales that produces a hyperuniform hash distribution. We investigate the dynamics of hashing using interparticle winding statistics, and find that hashing starts with large-scale winding of kinetically disjoint regions of the chaotic attractor, which gradually gives way to smaller scale braiding of single-particle trajectories. In addition to providing a physically motivated approach to implementing and analyzing deterministic chaotic maps for cryptographic applications, we anticipate that our approach has applications in microfluidic proof-of-work systems and characterizing large-scale turbulent flows from sparse tracer data.

TI Practical Constant-Size Ring Signature
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Bitcoin has gained its popularity for almost 10 years as a "secure and anonymous digital currency". However, according to several recent researches, we know that it can only provide pseudonymity rather than real anonymity, and privacy has been one of the main concerns in the system similar to Bitcoin. Ring signature is a good method for those users who need better anonymity in cryptocurrency. It was first proposed by Rivest et al. based upon the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) assumption in 2006, which allows a user to sign a message anonymously on behalf of a group of users even without their coordination. The size of ring signature is one of the dominating parameters, and constant-size ring signature (where signature size is independent of the ring size) is much desirable. Otherwise, when the ring size is large, the resultant ring signature becomes unbearable for power limited devices or leads to heavy burden over the communication network. Though being extensively studied, currently there are only two approaches for constant-size ring signature. Achieving practical constant-size ring signature is a long-standing open problem since its introduction. In this work, we solve this open question. We present a new constant-size ring signature scheme based on bilinear pairing and accumulator, which is provably secure under the random oracle (RO) model. To the best of our knowledge, it stands for the most practical ring signature up to now.

AB Cryptocurrencies have experienced an exponential growth trend in the past 24 months, followed by a big crash. In the early years of the Internet, inspired entrepreneurs such as Jeffrey Bezos realized that, when something grows exponentially, it becomes ubiquitous within a short time span. Similarly to the Internet in 1994, cryptocurrencies have recently been growing at a dazzling rate, thus one can expect them to be used on a global scale very soon, in spite of the last bubble which has already burst. Alternative currencies are greeted with great enthusiasm, due to their potential to return financial power back to the people, especially in the context of general dissatisfaction and disappointment with the banking sector. They bring about several advantages, such as financial innovations, lower fees as well as increased availability to developing populations. At the same time, their high volatility and lack of supervision might imply that they only serve as complementary financing and not as a substitute of traditional banking. This article discusses the development of cryptocurrencies, including aspects related to Bitcoin, financial technology and the blockchain. Using historical data from Coinmarketcap. com between April 2013 and February 2018, I run a quantitative analysis of the distributions and evolution over time for all listed cryptocurrencies with known market capitalization. I look at the interplay between number of cryptocurrencies and market value, at growth rates, cumulative shares and volatility. I find a phenomenon of exponential growth and violent volatility, which I explain in light of cryptocurrencies' strengths and weaknesses, as identified in the literature. I emphasize the importance of cryptocurrencies in the context of the global digital economy and I discuss future implications.

TI Cloud Message Queueing and Notification: Challenges and (Blockchain)
   Opportunities
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
AB The current mobile app development practice, like other large-scale network-centric software projects, is characterized by the use of event notification facilities supporting the exchange of effective and efficient data flows between the application's front-end, usually located on customer's terminal equipment, and the back-end services available within the cloud. In order to avoid the need of setting up the notification infrastructure from scratch for any new application, many cloud service providers and mobile system manufacturing companies provide cloud-based messaging solutions. Such solutions, however, are often characterized by vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the mobile applications' security by violating the privacy and integrity in their operations. In this work, we analyze these issues and posit the potential for the blockchain technology to mitigate such threats.

AB Blockchain technology is widely known because it is the underlying technology used by the bitcoin. It became more popular because it also can be used as backbone for various applications in finance, media, security and others. One of the main concerns for this technology is how secure the information that the users distributed over the network. This paper studies and highlights the important security issues concerned and discusses the solutions that proposed by the researchers and theoretical solution proposed to address some of the issues. However, this approach needs to be investigated further if it is to be implemented later in the near future. This paper can give direction for future researchers who are interested of this area.

AB Since it first appears in 2008 as the underlying technology of the Bitcoin payment system, Blockchain has gained further interests, since it offers a distributed peer-to-peer ledger where non-trusting members can interact with each other, in addition, members can now run applications without the need for a central authority with the same level of certainty. however blockchain suffers from certain limitations and challenges, specifically, when combined with Internet of things (iot) infrastructure, namely the high cost needed in the mining process due to restricted computation resources of iot devices, in this paper we will focus on a survey on three of most relevant papers that discuss resources management in mobile blockchain then we we will propose a matching model based on graph theory for optimal resources allocation between services offered by an Edge service provider and demands from miners of a blockchain network.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted increasing attention in recent years. One reason for this new trend is the introduction of on-chain smart contracts enabling the implementation of decentralized applications in trust-less environments. Along with its adoption, attacks exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities are inevitably growing. To counter these attacks and avoid breaches, several approaches have been explored such as documenting vulnerabilities or model checking using formal verification. However, these approaches fail to capture the blockchain and users behavior properties. In this paper, we propose a novel formal modeling approach to verify a smart contract behavior in its execution environment. We apply this formalism on a concrete smart contract example and analyze its breaches with a statistical model checking approach.

AB Nowadays, blockchain is seen as one of the main technological innovations. Many applications can rely on the blockchain to secure their exchanges. However, applications with private interest cannot rely on public blockchains. First, in a public blockchain, anyone can read the whole data of the blockchain. Second, anyone can participate to the "consensus process"; the process for determining the validity of each transaction. Consortium and fully private blockchains aim to combine forcefulness of blockchains with controlled consensus process and stricter permissions for deploying a node and joining the blockchain network. In both consortium and fully private blockchains, the number of peers on the blockchain network is very small in comparison with public blockchain. Nonetheless, by targeting the nodes of blockchains, an attacker can easily manage the whole blockchain and takes control of the consensus process to validate his illegitimate transactions. In this paper, to defend blockchain nodes from DNS amplification attacks, we propose a scalable and proactive solution in the context of software defined networks (SDN), named ChainSecure. ChainSecure consists of 3 schemes: (1) StateMap, a novel stateful mapping scheme (SMS) to perform a mapping one-to-one between DNS request and response; (2) Entropy calculation scheme (ECS) to measure the disorder / randomness of data using sFlow in order to detect illegitimate flows; (3) DNS DDoS Mitigation (DDM) module to effectively mitigate illegitimate DNS requests. The experimental results show that ChainSecure protects blockchain nodes and can detect/mitigate the attack quickly to achieve high accuracy in detecting illegitimate DNS traffic making it a promising solution to protect blockchain nodes from DNS amplification attacks.

AB The security is becoming the most important challenge that threatens the development of the internet of things. In this respect, access control is considered as the cornerstone and core element that should be well designed and implemented. However, this mission becomes more complex in IoT environments as they have additional and specific requirements such as heterogeneity, limited capacities of storage and computing as well as the huge number of the devices. Dealing with this issue, this paper proposes an 'emergence based' process aiming to benefit from this tremendous number of smart objects and extract the significant features that we cannot pick up in systems with smallest number. Then, it proposes an access control framework dedicated to IoT environments based on three extremely powerful concepts: Blockchain networks, Reputation systems and Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

AB Blockchain technology is already being talked about as one of the megatrends for the next years. Researchers and organisations are starting to understand the potential benefits of this technology and are exploring how it can disrupt the world we live in with a diverse range of applications. But the truth is the ability to move blockchain from concept to adoption and production has been minimal yet. When it comes to auditing, blockchain solutions could have important benefits by reducing the workload of the auditors, helping in minimising fraud and optimising the existing processes but is also vital to have in mind other emerging technologies. Factom, Libra, and Verady are some examples of companies developing blockchain solutions that can be applied in the auditing environment, but much of the necessary development is still yet to be done.

Bitcoin creates virtual money using Blockchain that's become popular over the world. Blockchain is a shared public ledger, and it includes all transactions which are confirmed. It is almost impossible to crack the hidden information in the blocks of the Blockchain. However, there are certain security and technical challenges like scalability, privacy leakage, selfish mining, etc. which hampers the wide application of Blockchain. In this paper, we briefly discuss this emerging technology namely Blockchain. In addition, we extrapolate in-depth insight on Blockchain technology.

AB Neural networks is considered one of the most developed concept in artificial intelligence, due to its ability to solve complex computational tasks, and its efficiency to find solutions. There is a wide range of applications that adopt this technique, one of which is in the financial investment issues. This paper presents an approach to predict stock market ratios using artificial neural networks. It considers two different techniques-BPA-MLP and LSTM-RNN-their potential, and their limitations. Tests were conducted on different data sets, such as Facebook (TM) stocks, Google (TM) stocks, and Bitcoin (TM) stocks. We achieve a best-case accuracy of 97% for MLP algorithm, and 99.5% for LSTM algorithm. While the results appear to be promising, a web interface is presented in order to accept a certain amount of money, and accordingly checks the best stock to invest in.

AB The fifth generation of mobile networks is rapidly evolving, fueled by the ever-growing mobile traffic over recent years. Ultra-reliable and low latency provisioning of services with ranging contextual parameters mapped to highly fluctuating levels of quality of service and quality of user experience, render the optimum operation point of the future networks unsustainable. Network coding is emerging once more as a potential key enabler for optimizing bandwidth requirements and energy consumption in highly dense mobile network environments. Nonetheless, network coding deployments still need to consider security vulnerabilities and their countermeasures, before they can be adapted as part of the emerging mobile network deployments. This paper studies the performance of random linear network coding for wireless mobile networks with an emphasis on pollution attacks while proposing a novel blockchain based message authentication scheme in order to minimize delays and signalling costs.

AB The concept of cyber-physical production systems is highly discussed amongst researchers and industry experts, however, the implementation options for these systems rely mainly on obsolete technologies. Despite the fact that the blockchain is most often associated with cryptocurrency, it is fundamentally wrong to deny the universality of this technology and the prospects for its application in other industries. For example, in the insurance sector or in a number of identity verification services. This article discusses the deployment of the CPPS backbone network based on the Ethereum private blockchain system. The structure of the network is described as well as its interaction with the help of smart contracts, based on the consumption of cryptocurrency for various operations.

AB The two major roadblocks for state of the art Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure like smart buildings, smart cities, etc. are lack of trust between various entities of system and single point of failure which is a vulnerability causing extreme damage to the whole system. This paper proposes a blockchain based IoT security solution where, trust is established through the immutable and decentralized nature of blockchain. The distributed nature of blockchain makes the system more robust and immune to single point of failure. We propose a mechanism to establish continuous security in the system by evaluating legitimate presence of user in valid IoT-Zone continuously without user intervention. Every user interaction in an IoT environment is stored in blockchain as a transaction and series of these transactions represent a user's IoT-trail. A unique digital crypto-token is required for a user interaction to be legitimate. This token is used as an access control mechanism to prevent any unauthorized access to the system. Tokens are pre-generated using a prediction model based on user's IoT-trail in the blockchain. By using blockchain as an underlying framework in IoT environment and through the method of continuous security, we made the system more secure, robust and interoperable.

AB Significant improvements have been made in the way several businesses are conducted due to the influx of blockchain technology, which is a paradigm shift in research these days. Because of the several benefits this technology brings, including scalability, immutability, and the ability to secure data exchange among parties, data transfer becomes easier and simpler between entities. Automobile renting is a major business nowadays. Renting an auto summons numerous frameworks over a chain of procedures - including confirming the lessee's financial status, driving qualifications, accessible vehicle stock and car features. Leasing companies and financiers, however, need to recognize what is happening to the vehicles after the rent is agreed upon. There is also the problem of time consumption, as the traditional car lease process passes through a lot of stages before completion. The blockchain innovation can keep things up to speed with smart contracts. In this paper, we develop a car lease platform that is solely based on blockchain technology. The underlying principle utilized in this system is the smart contract, which is a programmable script that enforces decisions on all transactions made on the system, and also applies penalties to perpetrators. We evaluate the efficiency of our system by measuring the latency and throughput, and make comparisons with other related systems. Results indicate our system outperforms the others.

AB Identity Management (IDM) in cloud-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications is critical in many businesses. However, most conventional IDM systems are costly and hinder the innovation and greater customer experience. By using blockchain, a new way of managing the identities is proposed. This paper presents an initiative to improve IDM by integrating face recognition approach and blockchain technology in an integrated IoT-cloud application. To illustrate the proposed initiative, a decentralized campus wide printing service is chosen as a use case. In this use case, face recognition is used as an entry point to the service. Since face recognition involves a lot of complex computations and machine learning, this process is executed on a cloudlet, hence minimizing the need for massive data transfer to a distant cloud. Once a user's login information is digitally verified via immutable blockchain, smart contract is deployed to keep track of the user's printing activities. The integration of blockchain in this service has decentralized the IDM, automated the service, and kept the service inexpensive and transparent.

AB In past, several Certificate Authority (CA) compromise and subsequent mis-issue of certificate raise the importance of certificate transparency and dynamic trust management for certificates. Certificate Transparency (CT) provides transparency for issued certificates, thus enabling corrective measure for a mis-issued certificate by a CA. However, CT and existing mechanisms cannot convey the dynamic trust state for a certificate. To address this weakness, we propose Smart Contract-assisted PKI (SCP) a smart contract based PKI extension - to manage dynamic trust network for PKI. SCP enables distributed trust in PKI, provides a protocol for managing dynamic trust, assures trust state of a certificate, and provides a better trust experience for end-users.

AB The emergence of blockchain technology has created a frenzy and a mind shift for organizations and industries. Governments and international bodies are increasingly discussing the potential implications of blockchain's distributed ledgers on business, governments and the economy. The intended purpose of the blockchain technology is to connect business network members in a decentralized way. The technology enables exchange and sharing of information without the involvement of intermediaries acting as arbitrators. Powered by its decentralized nature, the network will not have any single point of failure and will not rely on any single entity. Hence, blockchain eliminates the risks of centralization. This paper discusses a scenario of a blockchain technology in distributed ledgers to manage a well function and secure supply chain.

AB Surveillance and secrecy breaching incidents of users' privacy questioned the current third-parties data collection procedure. Massive amounts of Personally Identifiable Information (PH) are being exploited due to malpractice, identity theft, spamming, phishing and cyber-espionage. A large amount of data flow from users to enterprises for data-driven market analysis and prediction. Consequently, it is tough to track the flow and genuineness of PII. Blockchain technology, an 'immutable' distributed ledger which can efficaciously track PH exchange, store, and distribution. In contrast, ongoing EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands 'right to forget' and 'should be erasable' rights. However, this paper proposes an off-chain Blockchain architecture which uses both local database and distributed ledgers to preserve a trustable PH life cycle. Considering the key factors of GDPR, prevailing Blockchain architecture were modified and a prototype was created to validate our proposed architecture using multichain 2.0. Proposed architecture stores PH and Non-PII physically separated location. Finally, with proposed architecture user will realm privacy and rigidity of Blockchain along with the privacy regulation of GDPR. Validation is done by comparing proposed system with existing methodology from technical aspects, future research scopes is also well advocated.

There are different approaches to think about web 3.0, some; would say the future is when we have a semantic web others would argue that the future is the virtual web. In this paper, we will talk about another direction to think about the future web called the decentralized web. To enhance the web, we should be concerned with solving the problems that we have and the problems that these platforms have created. The decentralized web is focused on developing protocols and the underlying technologies that are not noticed by end users. This paper gives an overview of the challenges in the current web 2.0. Describes the decentralized web, and what are the technologies that are in development now.

AB Recently, there have been numerous advances in the quantum computing area in research laboratories of companies such as IBM, Google, Microsoft, and so on. As a consequence, the cryptography community started to focus their attention on cryptographic primitives which have the potential of remaining secure on quantum computers. One of the most researched cryptographic primitives are the signature schemes especially because of the emergence and raise in popularity of the cryptocurrencies. Currently, safe signature schemes are very important in keeping safe fortunes in the form of crypto tokens.
   One of the signature schemes resistant against quantum computers is the Lamport one-time signature scheme. As the name suggests, its main drawback is that a private key can only be used to safely sign a single message.
   In this paper, we propose the Lamport n-time signature scheme, which is an extension of the Lamport one-time signature scheme and allows for a private key to be used to safely encrypt n messages with a shorter signature, but with an increase in the size of the private and public keys. Specifically, instead of signing each value of each bit, as in the standard Lamport one-time signature scheme, we sign each value of each block of log(2)(n + 1) bits interpreted as an integer.
   In the Lamport one-time signature scheme, a signature discloses one out of two private key components for each bit, while in the Lamport n-time signature scheme, a signature discloses one out of n+1 private key components for each block of bits of length log(2)(n + 1). This means that an attacker needs n+1 chosen messages in order to uncover the entire private key for the Lamport n-time signature scheme as opposed to 2 chosen messages needed to uncover the entire private key for the Lamport one-time signature scheme.

AB NEOM is one of the Saudi Arabia's vision projects to build an intelligent environment where the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key technologies. This technology refers to the interconnection among various devices using the Internet to track, analyze, and process the data during running time. The technology is developing rapidly with extensive attention given to enhancing its security level. Indeed, due to their dependency on a centralized architecture, IoT objects can become vulnerable points and targets for several attacks. Moreover, using the traditional security mechanisms with static measures may be inappropriate to the dynamic nature of the IoT environment. In this study, we will investigate the problem of IoT security issues and what the possibility of employing promising technologies such a BlockChain (BC) to enhance the security aspect of IoT environment, especially on the application layer. The BC is an infrastructure that broadcasts the resources to all participants with consensus verification. This trending technology overrides the drawbacks of central authority and provides a distributed architecture. For these reasons, multiple studies began to utilize the promising BlockChain technology but research in this area is at preliminary stages.

AB Circular, data-driven healthcare is increasingly being considered as an effective model to provide efficient, cost-effective and sustainable healthcare services in the future. Central to this model is the service-dominant "building-block"-type provision of care services to patients, paired with the collaboration of healthcare providers through a common infrastructure. This combination enables the forming of a decentralized, holistic care cycle. Sharing of patient medical information is pivotal towards reaching this goal; however, preserving medical record integrity and privacy, while at the same time allowing provider interoperability are often conflicting requirements. Blockchains and Smart Contracts can provide the underlying technology to support the decentralized care cycle by addressing patient privacy and medical record integrity, while simultaneously offering efficient interoperability between providers. To demonstrate how this could be achieved, a conceptual medical record access and sharing mechanism is presented which is suitable for a system operating within a regulated healthcare jurisdiction.

AB Implementing a circular economy business model which is profitable for businesses operating physical assets, while at the same time does not conflict with strategic goals of environmental policies can be a complex and risky undertaking for a single entity, especially if the asset operator is a small-to-medium enterprise (SMEs). To mitigate this, a collaborative circular economy business model is proposed, where the circular economy cycle is materialized by assets transitioning between asset operators on a demand-driven approach. Demand itself is partially based on the asset's state, which is described by its circular properties (location, condition, availability). The asset state and its transition between operators can be monitored by auditors and governmental regulators to ensure asset integrity and compliance with environmental targets. This common view of asset state between all parties can be enabled by blockchains and smart contracts, which can provide the underlying technology to share data with integrity, while simultaneously offering more efficient interoperability between participants. To demonstrate how this could be achieved, a conceptual asset record access and sharing mechanism is presented which is suitable for regulated environmental jurisdictions.

AB Learning Analytics collect sensitive data from students. In some cases, the ethics behind the use or access by third parties are not clear. This situation raises adverse reactions and feelings of fear that generates a negative perception towards the use of Learning Analytics. In consequence, it is questioned whether privacy and security can be preserved when collecting educational data. As a result, some policies and good practices are set to frame how student data should be used in the application of this analytical approach. Its objective is to increase confidence in the application of Learning Analytics. However, some of these legal actions, which are limited to the areas in which they are originated, are the result of allegations of data leakage. Hence, these initiatives can do little to insure the use of sensitive data of students in unknown situations. To ensure continuity and an increase of confidence in the application of Learning Analytics is necessary to bind to legality a new approach to safeguard privacy of students' data in its current and future uses. Considering the above, it is possible to add a technological layer above these policies that ensures its viability. Some emerging technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts are strong candidates to ensure privacy and secure sensible data of students. The use of smart contracts allows the automation of legal actions so that they are executed as soon as irregularities in the use or data collection are detected. In this work, we propose a series of actions to preserve the identity of students and secure their data with emerging technologies such as blockchain.

AB Blockchain shows a huge prospective in the coming future. It is a technology that provides the possibility of generating and sharing transaction ledgers that are tamper proof. Use cases of Blockchain are enlarging in numbers and width in multiple areas like, Internet of Things (IoT), finance and security. Even though many public and private sectors are introducing this technology, it remains a fear to others due to their lack of familiarity and the point of it not taking any big role in any major security enterprises till now. In this paper we will explain what is a blockchain and define its characteristics, benefits, and the differences between them. And help in choosing the suitable type that accommodates your needs. Then we present the immutability aspect of blockchain and its benefits and compare it with a traditional database. And finally, we will discuss blockchain security (For public and private blockchains) and compare it with a standard cyber security environment and discuss both of them in different cyber-attack scenarios.

TI Money after Blockchain: Gold, Decentralised Politics and the New
   Libertarianism
SO AUSTRALIAN FEMINIST STUDIES
AB Blockchain technologies are central to what has been described as a new smart social contract'. With blockchain, individual cryptographic identity becomes the basis for new forms of money and for a whole suite of restructured social, political and financial transactions. But what do these developments signal for feminist engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a feminist weapon'. But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered, racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend representations of gold along with the metallism' surrounding blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of fundamental value returns, together with related associations of essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background for the new libertarianism' whose ascendency now overshadows the neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some decades.

AB In recent years, Blockchain technology has been highly valued and disruptive. Several researches have presented a merge between blockchain and current application i.e. medical, supply chain, and e-commerce. Although Blockchain architecture does not have a standard yet, IBM, MS, AWS offer BaaS (Blockchain as a Service). In addition to the current public chains i.e. Ethereum,,NEO, and Cardeno; there are some differences between several public ledgers in terms of development and architecture. This paper introduces the main factors that affect integration of Artificial Intelligence with Blockchain. As well as, how it could be integrated for forecasting and automating; building self-regulated chain.

AB A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets.
   Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currencies, alternative currencies and virtual currencies. Cryptocurrencies use decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money and central banking systems. The decentralized control of each cryptocurrency works through a blockchain, which is a public transaction database,functioning as a distributed ledger.
   Neural Networks field has many techniques to perform predictions. They are widely used to predict the future values of stock exchange indicators variables. In this paper we will try to use Artificial Neural Network to predict cryptocurrencies close prices, and we'll study the difference in price change with the normal stock exchanges.

AB With the recent prevalence of darkweb/deepweb (D2web) sites specializing in the trade of exploit kits and malware, malicious actors have easy-access to a wide-range of tools that can empower their offensive capability. In this study, we apply concepts from causal reasoning, itemset mining, and logic programming on historical cryptocurrency-related cyber incidents with intelligence collected from over 400 D2web hacker forums. Our goal was to find indicators of cyber threats targeting cryptocurrency traders and exchange platforms from hacker activity. Our approach found interesting activities that, when observed together in the D2web, subsequent cryptocurrency-related incidents are at least twice as likely to occur than they would if no activity was observed. We also present an algorithmic extension to a previously-introduced algorithm called APT-Extract that allows to model new semantic structures that are specific to our application.

AB We tackle the problem of enabling Autonomous Systems to evaluate network providers on the basis of their adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) regarding interconnection agreements. In current Internet practices, choices of interconnection partners are driven by factors such as word of mouth, personal relationships, brand recognition and market intelligence, and not by proofs of previous performance. Given that Internet eXchange Points provide increasingly more peering choices, rudimentary schemes for picking interconnection partners are not adequate anymore.
   Although the current interconnection ecosystem is shrouded in confidentiality, our key observation is that recently-emerged blockchain technology and advances in cryptography enable a privacy-preserving decentralized solution based on actual performance measurements. We propose the concept of SLA score to evaluate network providers and introduce a privacy-preserving protocol that allows networks to compute and verify SLA scores.

AB A blockchain is a distributed ledger and the underlying technology of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, allowing it to operate in a decentralized fashion with no intermediaries such as financial institutions. The use of blockchain, however, will be far beyond the financial sector; smart contracts, for example would allow business and legal agreements to be stored and executed online. It is anticipated that blockchain will do to middle-and back-office functions what the Internet and the Web have done to the front-office -automate functions. In this paper, we investigate what Chief Information Officers (CIOs) think of blockchain and how they plan to utilize it for their organizations. We conducted a survey that was completed by 25 CIOs in the United Arab Emirates and found mixed feelings about the technology and barriers for use. In this paper, we also discuss opportunities and challenges in adopting blockchain.

AB One of the fundamental characteristics of blockchain technology is the consensus protocol. Most of the current consensus protocols are PoW (Proof of Work) based, or fixed-validators based. Nevertheless, PoW requires massive computational effort, which results in high energy and computing resources consumption. Alternatively, fixed-validators protocols rely on fixed, static validators responsible for validating all newly proposed blocks, which opens the door for adversaries to launch several attacks on these validators such as DDoS and eclipse attacks. In this paper, we propose a truly decentralized consensus protocol that does not require PoW and randomly employs a different set of different size of validators on each block's proposal. Additionally, our protocol utilizes a game theoretical model to enforce the honest validators' behavior by rewarding honest validators and penalizing dishonest ones. We have analyzed our protocol and shown that it mitigates various attacks that current protocols suffer from.

AB Blockchain technology is currently emerging as the next promising revolutionary technology. Many different applications have started to venture into this technology. The decentralization and distribution nature of blockchain allows dynamic applications to be build on it, including Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. IoT devices have been commonly linked to smart systems with its applications mainly surrounding on event detection and monitoring. Coupling this IoT capabilities with blockchain network offers great potential for scalable event detection and monitoring for large-scale network. Nevertheless, detection mechanism should be able to scale up with such requirements. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework on implementation of distributed pattern recognition for event monitoring within IoT-blockchain network. This conceptual framework is supported by a preliminary study on IoT-blockchain implementation and distributed pattern recognition implementation using a Graph Neuron (GN) approach.

AB The collection of students' sensible data raises adverse reactions against Learning Analytics that decreases the confidence in its adoption. The laws and policies that surround the use of educational data are not enough to ensure privacy, security, validity, integrity and reliability of students' data. This problem has been detected through literature review and can be solved if a technological layer of automated checking rules is added above these policies. The aim of this thesis is to research about an emerging technology such as blockchain to preserve the identity of students and secure their data. In a first stage a systematic literature review will be conducted in order to set the context of the research. Afterwards, and through the scientific method, we will develop a blockchain based solution to automate rules and constraints with the aim to let students the governance of their data and to ensure data privacy and security.

AB Most of the existing RFID based ownership transfer protocols are in need of TTP or require reader to reader communication in a centralized system. In the post supply chain, the products are to be tracked to prove their originality in a distributed environment. This paper aims to provide a verifiable ownership transfer of products attached with an RFID tag using blockchain technology to address various security requirements. The proposed protocol consists of two phases; in the first phase the buyer commits to buy the product and in the second phase actual ownership is transferred from the seller to the buyer. Analysis of the proposed protocol is carried out and it shows that our protocol is relatively better than the existing related schemes with respect to security requirements.

AB We propose a new way to organise both transactions and blocks in a distributed ledger to address the performance issues of permissionless ledgers. In contrast to most of the existing solutions in which the ledger is a chain of blocks extracted from a tree or a graph of chains, we present a distributed ledger whose structure is a balanced directed acyclic graph of blocks. We call this specific graph a SYC-DAG. We show that a SYC-DAG allows us to keep all the remarkable properties of the Bitcoin blockchain in terms of security, immutability, and transparency, while enjoying higher throughput and self-adaptivity to transactions demand. To the best of our knowledge, such a design has never been proposed so far.

AB The presence of forks in permissionless blockchains is a recurrent issue. So far this has been handled either a posteriori, through local arbitration rules (e.g., "keep the branch which has required the most computational power") which are applied once a fork is present in the blockchain, or a priori, via a Byzantine resilient agreement protocol periodically invoked by a committee of well identified and online nodes. In the former case, local arbitration rules guarantee that if they are correctly applied by a majority of users, then with high probability forks are progressively resolved, while in the latter case, the sequence of Byzantine resilient agreements decide on the unique sequence of blocks to be appended to the blockchain. The question we may legitimately ask is the following one: To prevent the period of uncertainty inherent to optimistic-based solutions, are we doomed to rely on the decisions made by a unique committee whose members are already actively involved in the creation of blocks ? We negatively answer this question by presenting a solution that combines the best features of optimistic and pessimistic approaches: we leverage the presence of Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) owners and "the public-key as identities" principle to make UTXO owners (i.e. users) self-organize in small Byzantine resilient committees "around" each new object (i.e., blocks and transactions) to decide on their validity. Validated objects are conflict-free, which guarantees the absence of blockchain forks and allows for fast-payment transactions facility. This is achieved without fearing Sybil attacks and selfish mining attacks. We are not aware of any solutions enjoying such features.

AB At the first Information Hiding Workshop in 1996 we tried to clarify the models and assumptions behind information hiding. We agreed the terminology of cover text and stego text against a background of the game proposed by our keynote speaker Gus Simmons: that Alice and Bob are in jail and wish to hatch an escape plan without the fact of their communication coming to the attention of the warden, Willie. Since then there have been significant strides in developing technical mechanisms for steganography and steganalysis, with new techniques from machine learning providing ever more powerful tools for the analyst, such as the ensemble classifier. There have also been a number of conceptual advances, such as the square root law and effective key length. But there always remains the question whether we are using the right security metrics for the application. In this talk I plan to take a step backwards and look at the systems context. When can stegosystems actually be used? The deployment history is patchy, with one being Trucrypt's hidden volumes, inspired by the steganographic file system. Image forensics also find some use, and may be helpful against some adversarial machine learning attacks (or at least help us understand them). But there are other contexts in which patterns of activity have to be hidden for that activity to be effective. I will discuss a number of examples starting with deception mechanisms such as honeypots, Tor bridges and pluggable transports, which merely have to evade detection for a while; then moving on to the more challenging task of designing deniability mechanisms, from leaking secrets to a newspaper through bitcoin mixes, which have to withstand forensic examination once the participants come under suspicion.
   We already know that, at the system level, anonymity is hard. However the increasing quantity and richness of the data available to opponents may move a number of applications from the deception category to that of deniability.
   To pick up on our model of 20 years ago, Willie might not just put Alice and Bob in solitary confinement if he finds them communicating, but torture them or even execute them. Changing threat models are historically one of the great disruptive forces in security engineering.
   This leads me to suspect that a useful research area may be the intersection of deception and forensics, and how information hiding systems can be designed in anticipation of richer and more complex threat models. The ever-more-aggressive censorship systems deployed in some parts of the world also raise the possibility of using information hiding techniques in censorship circumvention. As an example of recent practical work, I will discuss Covertmark, a toolkit for testing pluggable transports that was partly inspired by Stirmark, a tool we presented at the second Information Hiding Workshop twenty years ago.

AB All record-keeping systems (which include monetary systems) must contend with trust issues and methods of organizing historical information. Conventional systems rely on the reputation of central authorities and record-keepers to achieve consensus. Blockchain, which powers Bitcoin, differs from conventional systems by achieving consensus through a community of anonymous (and therefore "trustless") agents who compete amongst themselves to authenticate transactions. The promise of the blockchain protocol is that it is invulnerable to human foibles. Novel, for sure; but is it worth all the effort?

AB In the Tor anonymity network, the distribution of topology information relies on the correct behavior of five out of the nine trusted directory authority servers. This centralization is concerning since a powerful adversary might compromise these servers and conceal information about honest nodes, leading to the full de-anonymization of all Tor users. Our work aims at distributing the work of these trusted authorities, such increasing resilience against attacks on core infrastructure components of the Tor network. In particular, we leverage several emerging technologies, such as blockchains, smart contracts, and trusted execution environments to design and prototype a system called SmarTor. This system replaces the directory authorities with a smart contract and a distributed network of untrusted entities responsible for bandwidth measurements. We prototyped SmarTor using Ethereum smart contracts and Intel SGX secure hardware. In our evaluation, we show that SmarTor produces significantly more reliable and precise measurements compared to the current measurement system. Overall, our solution improves the decentralization of the Tor network, reduces trust assumptions and increases resilience against powerful adversaries like law enforcement and intelligence services.

This paper was written using a systematic literature review (SLR) as one of the methodologies used to solve problems by tracing the results of previous studies. The problem that you want to study in SLR is usually referred to as a research question (RQ). The defined RQ is related to the topic and clarifies each question by tracing previous research papers indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Springerlink, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 41 articles, the result is: blockchain can be used in many applications, some applications that adopt blockchain technology are banking applications, e- voting applications and digital forensic applications. Often, applications that use blockchain technology only focus on developing one of the blockchain technologies that suits their needs. Some developers maximize the components of the contract on the blockchain, some further develop the data structure of the blockchain itself. The use of blockchain technology is still wide open for the implementation of other information systems. The expected contribution of this paper is to provide a general overview for researchers who want to build applications that use blockchain as a basis for researching so they can conduct further studies to better understand whether the applications they will develop are suitable for using blockchain technology as a basis.

AB It's has been years and we still have a lot of downtimes in the major online platforms we use. When we go deep down and understand the problem, it's all because of SPOF i.e. Single point of failure (which is a part of a system that, if it fails, it will stop the entire system from working). By this there is a possibility of downtime or hack or tampering of data or loss of data. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain, then a lot of communities like Ethereum, etc. have been developing dApp protocols and frameworks to build applications in blockchain. Also a world renowned framework called Hyperledger Project is also in development made by an open source community consisting of people from large organisations. Early days and also now we have been using a technology called Torrent which is also decentralized. And now the question why to use decentralized systems in regards of issues with the largest social media company the problem was with the data that it had stored. Imagine a network that gives you the full control and privacy of data you share, send and get. Also not having a single second of service unavailability. The main aim of the project is to build a database system to achieve the goal of decentralized internet.

AB We are witnessing an ongoing global trend towards the automation of almost any transaction through the employment of some Internet-based mean. Furthermore, the large spread of cloud computing and the massive emergence of the software as a service (Saas) paradigm have unveiled many opportunities to combine distinct services, provided by different parties, to establish higher level and more advanced services, that can be offered to end users and enterprises. Business-to-business (B2B) integration and third-party authorization (i.e. using standards like OAuth) are examples of processes requiring more parties to interact with each other to deliver some desired functionality. These kinds of interactions mostly consist of transactions and are usually regulated by some agreement which defines the obligations that involved parties have to comply with. In case one of the parties claims a violation of some clause of such agreement, disputes can occur if the party accused of the infraction refuses to recognize its fault. Moreover, in case of auditing, for convenience reasons a party may deny to have taken part in a given transaction, or may forge historical records related to that transaction. Solutions based on a trusted third party (TTP) have drawbacks: high overhead due to the involvement of an additional party, possible fees to pay for each transaction, and the risks stemming from having to blindly trust another party. If it were possible to only base on transaction logs to sort disputes out, then it would be feasible to get rid of any TTP and related short-comings. In this paper we propose SLAVE, a blockchain-based solution which does not require any TTP. Storing transactions in a public blockchain like Bitcoin's or Ethereum's provides strong guarantees on transactions' integrity, hence they can be actually used as proofs when controversies arise. The solution we propose defines how to embed transaction logs in a public blockchain, so that each involved party can verify the identity of the others while keeping confident the content of transactions.

AB One important way to improve product quality is by calibrating the instruments. Based on the traditional Digital Multimeter calibration process like gathering data, analysis and evaluation, make calibration certificate are still manually works. However, the calibrated measuring instrument is must be audited periodically, the data integrity is low since the calibration data only verified by laboratorium itself and the data on the calibration certificate can potentially be changed (datatampering) unilaterally to avoid the founded at the time of inspection from the auditor. Previous research as demonstrated that Digital Mutimeter calibration have been used information technology solutions using client-server and internet-enabled architectures, but the data management is still performed by centralized network. In this paper we have proposed system design of Blockchain-based technology for Digital Multimeter calibration which are a distributed system concept to every node in a network, but no nodes can control totally. Hence, the focus and the contribution of this paper is to proposed new system design as a Blockchain-based for Calibration of Digital Multimeter system. The proposed system design would have better data integrity to prevent potential data manipulation (tampering-data) for Digital Multimeter calibration results.

AB Border gateway protocol (BGP) version 4 is routing current Internet for more than 20 years. BGP is the only protocol that has proven its routing capability of such size network with continually growing nature. Although BGP is scalable and network layer reachability information it lacks quality of service metrics like latency. BGP routing decision algorithm uses as-path length between autonomous systems (AS) as main factor for most of its best-path calculations. Because of more affordable peering architectures as-path length is generally decreasing in worldwide internet network resulting in less efficient routes for real-time internet protocol traffic. This study proposes future internet architecture consisting of multiple AS which provide latency aware routing in software defined network (SDN). For highest reliability there are bilateral latency measurements between each pair of connected autonomous systems. Latency measurement results are stored in distributed decentralized blockchain network where each AS holds its share. Each AS hosts an SDN instance for interconnection with neighbor SDN controllers over AS border. SDN instances processes latency measurement data from blockchain network, validates data integrity and manages latency aware routing for real-time data flows.

AB Advancements in sensors and devices have enabled Internet of Things (IoT) adoption in various sectors, especially in domains looking to automate and increase their real-time decision making capabilities to improve efficiencies. Supply chain management in logistics is a perfect fit for adoption of IoT, since it involves shipment of assets being moved, tracked and housed by a number of machines, vehicles and people each day. Smart Contracts are terms and conditions parties can specify that assure trust in the enforceability of the contract and provide visibility at every step of a supply chain. IoT devices can write to a smart contract as a product moves from the factory floor to the store shelves, providing real-time visibility of an enterprises entire supply chain. This paper proposes a smart logistics solution encapsulating smart contracts, logistics planner and condition monitoring of the assets in the Supply Chain Management area. A prototype of the solution is implemented which demonstrates accountability, traceability and liability for asset handling across the supply chain by various parties involved in a logistics scenario.

AB The popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its various applications are growing rapidly. Trust in most IoT networks is presumed implicitly. This implicit assumption of trust can be abused by adversaries to disrupt the network and manipulate reputations of trusted devices. Spoofing devices' identities or forging new identities allows adversaries to masquerade and act as legitimate devices. Devices with forged identities are known as Sybils. In this paper, we propose an IoT trust model that uses permissioned blockchains that utilize Smart Contracts (executable policies) to evaluate trustworthiness of IoT devices by recording and validating IoT devices' identities to prevent Sybil attacks. Additionally, to show effectiveness of our model, we provide a proof-of-concept prototype of our model's key features.

AB The possibility of in-store payments would further increase the potential usefulness of cryptocurrencies. However, this would require much faster transaction verification than current solutions provide (one hour for Bitcoin) since customers are likely not prepared to wait a very long time for their purchase to be accepted by a store. We propose a solution for enabling instore payments with waiting times in the order of a few seconds, which is still compatible with the current Bitcoin protocol. The idea is based on a payment card in combination with a protocol for ensuring that losing a card does not mean losing the money on it. We analyse the required transaction verification delay and also the potentially added risks that the solution brings compared to current systems.

AB Blockchain is a brand-new technology invented to evade the global financial industry from smashing again. Unfortunately, only a small portion of people realise this new technology and the way to incorporate it into their work, leaving a significant gap in utilising the benefits of such technologies. In response to the gap, we have designed a simulation game related to Blockchain, which targets to enlighten and encourage entrepreneurs and students to utilise Blockchain. The simulation was evaluated by a group of participants using prior-questionnaire and post-questionnaire. The results indicated that the simulations could help to promote the understanding of the Blockchain concepts, and thus may facilities its broader applications in the future.

AB Payment channels are the most prominent solution to the blockchain scalability problem. We introduce the problem of network design with fees for payment channels from the perspective of a Payment Service Provider (PSP). Given a set of transactions, we examine the optimal graph structure and fee assignment to maximize the PSP's profit. A customer prefers to route transactions through the PSP's network if the cheapest path from sender to receiver is financially interesting, i.e., if the path costs less than the blockchain fee. When the graph structure is a tree, and the PSP facilitates all transactions, the problem can be formulated as a linear program. For a path graph, we present a polynomial time algorithm to assign optimal fees. We also show that the star network, where the center is an additional node acting as an intermediary, is a near-optimal solution to the network design problem.

AB Due to the anonymous and remote nature of Electronic Commerce (E-commerce), reviews of products and vendors left by previous customers have emerged as an integral part of most online transactions. The reviews may influence the decision of customers buying the product since E-commerce websites/services do not allow customers to validate and inspect products in-store. In this paper, we analyze data from two BITCOIN marketplaces which include transactions between marketplace users and the ratings of those transactions given by those users. In this analysis we create a synthetic network model with similar topological properties as the networks of the interactions of both marketplaces. The results of our analysis show an interesting phenomenon in which user ratings, which range from -10 to 10, converge to a value of approximately two as the number of a user's transactions increase. Finally, we suggest future work on our synthetic model to improve its agreement with the transaction networks in order to better understand how reviews influence user decisions on transactions.

TI Privacy Requirements in Cybersecurity Applications of Blockchain
SO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: PLATFORMS, TOOLS AND USE CASES
SE Advances in Computers
AB Blockchain has promise as an approach to developing systems for a number of applications within cybersecurity. In Blockchain-based systems, data and authority can be distributed, and transparent and reliable transaction ledgers created. Some of the key advantages of Blockchain for cybersecurity applications are in conflict with privacy properties, yet many of the potential applications have complex requirements for privacy. Privacy-enabling approaches for Blockchain have been introduced, such as private Blockchains, and methods for enabling parties to act pseudonymously, but it is as yet unclear which approaches are suitable in which applications. We explore a set of proposed uses of Blockchain within cybersecurity and consider their requirements for privacy. We compare these requirements with the privacy provision of Blockchain and explore the trade-off between security and privacy, reflecting on the effect of using privacy-enabling approaches on the security advantages that Blockchain can offer.

AB The systems with a short window of opportunity for actions and decisions require developing solutions providing real-time streaming analytics. Real-time big data streaming analytics is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a streaming big data architecture for real-time social network analysis. As a case study, we investigated the relation between the public opinions on social media about cryptocurrencies and the changes in their prices using lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches with the goal of assessing the feasibility of predicting the prices of cryptocurrencies. Two different approaches with two lexicons were used for sentiment analysis score calculations to assess the consistency of correlation measures on the collected dataset. Our model indicates that the prediction of cryptocurrency price changes using lexicon-based sentiment analysis methods is not reliable.

AB Diabetes is one of the most common disease over the world which requires a daily self-care in order to be controlled. Nowadays, diabetes self-management can benefit from the recent advanced technologies such as Internet of things (wearables and medical sensors) to take measurements and track health data. In this paper, we present a platform architecture based on the IoT and Blockchain to facilitate the follow-up of diabetes and to help patients to self-manage it properly. Our architecture combines the IoT with the Blockchain technology in order to collect patients' data, share it with their healthcare teams in a near real-time and in a secure manner while preserving patient's privacy.

AB Smart contracts have been proposed as executable implementations enforcing real-life contracts. Unfortunately, the semantic gap between these allows for the smart contract to diverge from its intended deontic behaviour. In this paper we show how a deontic contract can be used for real-time monitoring of smart contracts specifically and request-based interactive systems in general, allowing for the identification of any violations. The deontic logic of actions we present takes into account the possibility of action failure (which we can observe in smart contracts), allowing us to consider novel monitorable semantics for deontic norms. For example, taking a rights-based view of permissions allows us to detect the violation of a permission when a permitted action is not allowed to succeed. A case study is presented showing this approach in action for Ethereum smart contracts.

AB Processes in the insurance economy are often cumbersome and expensive because of the inherently opposing interests of insurers and customers. Smart contracts bear a large potential to simplify these processes and thereby reduce costs. In this paper, we present CAIPY, our smart contract-based ecosystem for simple and transparent car insurance. In CAIPY, smart contracts do not replace but support current processes to enable significant cost savings, e.g., by removing the necessity for manual inspection of insurance claims in presence of tamper resistant car sensors. However, the involved parties can resort to well-established processes at any time, trading off cost efficiency against process reliability. CAIPY thus showcases how smart contracts can support insurers without introducing new risks.

AB We present a novel Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol, Ouroboros Genesis, that enables parties to safely join (or rejoin) the protocol execution using only the genesis block information. Prior to our work, PoS protocols either required parties to obtain a trusted "checkpoint" block upon joining and, furthermore, to be frequently online or required an accurate estimate of the number of online parties to be hardcoded into the protocol logic. This ability of new parties to "bootstrap from genesis" was a hallmark property of the Bitcoin blockchain and was considered an important advantage of PoW-based blockchains over PoS-based blockchains since it facilitates robust operation in a setting with dynamic availability, i.e., the natural setting-without external trusted objects such as checkpoint blocks-where parties come and go arbitrarily, may join at any moment, or remain offline for prolonged periods of time. We prove the security of Ouroboros Genesis against a fully adaptive adversary controlling less than half of the total stake in a partially synchronous network with unknown message delay and unknown, varying levels of party availability. Our security proof is in the Universally Composable setting assuming the most natural abstraction of a hash function, known as the strict Global Random Oracle (ACM-CCS 2014); this highlights an important advantage of PoS blockchains over their PoW counterparts in terms of composability with respect to the hash function formalisation: rather than a strict GRO, PoW-based protocol security requires a "local" random oracle. Finally, proving the security of our construction against an adaptive adversary requires a novel martingale technique that may be of independent interest in the analysis of blockchain protocols.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology that enables peer-to-peer transactions without a central authority. Bitcoin is known for resolving double-spending problems. When two or more miners generate a block that includes transaction information at nearly the same time, an accidental fork occurs. In this case, the longest chain of blocks is selected to avoid the double-spending problem. However, if there is an attacker node whose hash power is greater than half of the total hash power, that node can perform a double-spending attack, i.e., a 51% or majority attack. We propose a random mining group selection technique to reduce the probability of successful double-spending attacks. The analysis results demonstrate that if the number of groups is greater than or equal to two, the probability that the attacker will find the next block is less than 50%.

AB The radical growth of Bitcoin revolutionized the field of digital currencies by offering a secure replacement for online electronic payments like card payments and Internet banking. Notably, Bitcoin has become popular since it maintains the anonymity of the users and enables peer-to-peer instant payments across the world. It is a decentralized money transfer protocol that does transactions without exposing user credentials and does verifications without any third-party intervention. Though it maintains anonymity, decentralization concept introduced vulnerabilities leading to severe security issues like double spending, block withholding and 51% attacks. These issues necessitate security specific enhancements in Bitcoin protocol. Therefore, this paper proposes a method of incorporating criteria check for miners to participate in mining process and a verification process to join the mining pool. The proposed idea mitigates double spending, block withholding, and 51% attacks. Further, a new approach is proposed namely, refining block creation and verification strategy for improving transaction rate without compromising security.

AB Bitcoin has introduced a new concept that could feasibly revolutionise the entire Internet as it exists, and positively impact on many types of industries including, but not limited to, banking, public sector and supply chain. This innovation is grounded on pseudo-anonymity and strives on its innovative decentralised architecture based on the blockchain technology. Blockchain is pushing forward a race of transaction-based applications with trust establishment without the need for a centralised authority, promoting accountability and transparency within the business process. However, a blockchain ledger (e.g., Bitcoin) tend to become very complex and specialised tools, collectively called "Blockchain Analytics", are required to allow individuals, law enforcement agencies and service providers to search, explore and visualise it. Over the last years, several analytical tools have been developed with capabilities that allow, e.g., to map relationships, examine flow of transactions and filter crime instances as a way to enhance forensic investigations. This paper discusses the current state of blockchain analytical tools and presents a thematic taxonomy model based on their applications. It also examines open challenges for future development and research.

AB Blockchain technology has pioneered a new consensus approach to building a distributed public ledger globally. A key feature expected from cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems is the absence of a centralized control over the operation process. That is, blockchain solutions should neither rely on "trusted parties or powerful minority" for their operations, nor introduce such centralisation tendencies into blockchain systems.
   On the other hand, real-world blockchain systems require steady funding for continuous development and maintenance of the systems. Given that blockchain systems are decentralized systems, their maintenance and developmental funding should also be void of centralization risks. Therefore, secure and "community-inclusive" long-term sustainability of funding is critical for the health of blockchain platforms.
   In this work, for the first time, we provide a systematic exposition of blockchain development funding, planning, management, and disbursement mechanisms aka "treasury systems" (for cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems). Drawing from existing literature, we identify and categorise various treasury models, thereby enabling an exploration of their properties, benefits and drawbacks. Particularly, we perform an evaluation of real-world cryptocurrency treasury system of top cryptocurrencies e.g., Dash governance system, and ZCash Foundation. Finally, we briefly discuss desired properties of decentralised treasury systems and provide suggestions for improvement or alternative solutions to existing systems or implementations.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) is increasingly becoming the norm in both civilian and military settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security abstraction layer for IoT systems based on blockchain, which provides us a logical view of a system that comprises trusted devices. The goal of the proposed layer is to detect and isolate untrusted devices. The proposed abstraction layer provides three services, namely: authorization, authentication, and auditing by using blockchain and smart contract-based approaches. We adopt a hardware-based approach, where dedicated hardware modules are used to monitor the behavior of the firmware without incurring excessive performance overhead.

AB Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, has caused extensive research interest. There are many studies based on related protocols on Bitcoin, Bitcoin-based voting protocols also received attention in related literature.
   In this paper, we propose a Bitcoin-based decentralized privacy-preserving voting mechanism. It is assumed that there are n voters and m candidates. The candidate who obtains t ballots can get x Bitcoins from each voter, namely nx Bitcoins in total. We use a shuffling mechanism to protect voter's voting privacy, at the same time, decentralized threshold signatures were used to guarantee security and assign voting rights. The protocol can achieve correctness, decentralization and privacy-preserving. By contrast with other schemes, our protocol has a smaller number of transactions and can achieve a more functional voting method.

AB Recently, there has been growing interest in the field of cloud manufacturing (CM) amongst researchers in the manufacturing community. Cloud manufacturing is a customer-driven manufacturing model that was inspired by cloud computing, and its major objective was to provide ubiquitous on-demand access to services. However, the current CM architecture suffers from problems that are associated with a centralized based industrial network framework and third part operation. In a nutshell, centralized networking has had issues with flexibility, efficiency, availability, and security. Therefore, this paper aims to tackle these problems by introducing an ongoing project to a decentralized network architecture for cloud manufacturing which is based on the blockchain technology. In essence, this research paper introduces the blockchain technology as a decentralized peer to peer network for multiple cloud manufacturing providers.

AB The rise of blockchain technologies has given a boost to social good projects, which are trying to exploit various characteristic features of blockchains: the quick and inexpensive transfer of cryptocurrency, the transparency of transactions, the ability to tokenize any kind of assets, and the increase in trustworthiness due to decentralization. However, the swift pace of innovation in blockchain technologies, and the hype that has surrounded their "disruptive potential", make it difficult to understand whether these technologies are applied correctly, and what one should expect when trying to apply them to social good projects. This paper addresses these issues, by systematically analysing a collection of 120 blockchain-enabled social good projects. Focussing on measurable and objective aspects, we try to answer various relevant questions: which features of blockchains are most commonly used? Do projects have success in fund raising? Are they making appropriate choices on the blockchain architecture? How many projects are released to the public, and how many are eventually abandoned?

The idea that the blockchain will become a key solution for ensuring security and data consistency has long been controversial, even in more traditional areas such as finance or real-estate, for example. In this paper, an analysis of the two opposing sides is put forward and a review of the key aspects that need further evolution to ensure the blockchain's survival is presented. In the context of vehicular communications existing blockchain applications are examined with focus on certificate and reputation management, and message forwarding promotion. In this scope, the future of the blockchain is debated with emphasis on the key limitations of public implementations.

AB One of the challenges in developing multi-robot systems is the design of appropriate coordination strategies in such a way that robots perform their operations efficiently. In particular, efficient coordination requires judicious task allocation. Without appropriate task allocation, the use of multi-robot systems in complex scenarios becomes limited or even unfeasible. Real-world scenarios usually require the use of heterogeneous robots and task fulfillment with different structures, constraints, and degrees of complexity. In such scenarios, decentralised solutions seem to be appropriate for task allocation, since centralised solutions represent a single point of failure for the system. During the allocation process, in decentralised approaches, there are often communication requirements, as participants need to share information. Maintaining data integrity, resilience, and security in data access are some of the important features for this type of solution. In that direction, we propose an architecture for dynamic and decentralised allocation of tasks built on the idea of having communication and coordination in a multi-agent system through a private blockchain.

AB Mobile network operators can expand their capacity by aggregating their licensed spectrum with the spectrum discovered opportunistically, i.e., spatiotemporally unused spectrum by other primary users. For an accurate identification of the spectral opportunities, the mobile network has to deploy multiple sensors or it can offload this task to nearby nodes with sensing capabilities, so called helpers. Unfortunately, incentives are limited for helpers to perform energy-wasteful spectrum sensing. Instead, we envision spectrum sensing as a service (Spass) 1 in which a smart contract running on a blockchain (BC) describes the required sensing service parameters and the contracted helpers receive payments only if they perform sensing accurately as agreed in the contract. In this paper, we first introduce Spass and derive a closed formula defining the profitability of a Spass-based business as a function of the spectral efficiency, cost of helpers, and cost of the service. Moreover, we propose two-threshold based voting (TTBV) algorithm to ensure that the fraudulent helpers are excluded from Spass. Via numerical analysis, we show that TTBV causes almost zero false alarms and can exclude malicious users from the contract after only a few iterations. Finally, we develop a running prototype of Spass on Ethereum BC and share the related source code on a publicly-available repository.

AB This paper introduces BcWAN, a roaming solution for an IoT LoRa-based network that allows IoT end-devices to deliver data to their home network going through foreign 1 gateways.
   Our architecture removes the central core network and replaces it with a blockchain that handles the network access control. Any gateway in the system can communicate directly with another gateway in a peer-to-peer manner while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and soundness. Our work solves the fair exchange problem introduced in such architecture where no third party is involved thanks to a combination of encryption and specific blockchain techniques like custom script operators. We implement a proof of concept of the BcWAN architecture to gather an insight of the performance of the solution. We outline that BcWAN itself does not add any significant overhead to a near real-time IoT application by presenting preliminary test results.

The blockchain network records any media transaction with necessary information related to intellectual property rights, access control rules and content signature. The content signature, generated by compressed sensed samples or low-resolution, low bit-rate compression is used to verify the image integrity and authenticity. We propose that every blockchian record, linked to a unique transaction hash, is encapsulated within the metadata contained in the JPEG box structure. As an example use case we have chosen the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) sector due to its emerging need. This paper presents the proof of the concept and reports preliminary infrastructural development.

AB Abrupt changes in the miner hash rate applied to a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain can adversely affect user experience and security. Because different PoW blockchains often share hashing algorithms, miners face a complex choice in deciding how to allocate their hash power among chains. We present an economic model that leverages Modern Portfolio Theory to predict a miner's allocation over time using price data and inferred risk tolerance. The model matches actual allocations with mean absolute error within 20% for four out of the top five miners active on both Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchains. A model of aggregate allocation across those four miners shows excellent agreement in magnitude with the actual aggregate as well a correlation coefficient of 0.649. The accuracy of the aggregate allocation model is also sufficient to explain major historical changes in inter-block time (IBT) for BCH. Because estimates of miner risk are not time-dependent and our model is otherwise price-driven, we are able to use it to anticipate the effect of a major price shock on hash allocation and IBT in the BCH blockchain. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we show that, despite mitigation by the new difficulty adjustment algorithm, a price drop of 50% could increase the IBT by 50% for at least a day, with a peak delay of 100%.

AB Local energy markets could play a very important role in future electric power systems, allowing small electricity producers/consumers to trade within a small geographical area. In this context, an important challenge to allow the proper operation of a local energy market is to devise efficient and economic computational platforms in charge of data storage, data communication, and any other relevant computational requirements. Fortunately, the recent developments in blockchain-based mechanisms open up promising approaches that can support the effective management of local energy markets. In fact, blockchain technology allows, in particular, to carry out decentralised payments without involving a third party in charge of keeping track of the trades performed, which can potentially simplify and enhance the management of a local energy market significantly. Motivated by this, this paper will study the use of the blockchain-based Ethereum platform as the computational support for a local energy market. Specifically, this paper addresses the scalability of this platform in terms of number of participants in the local energy market, and in terms of trading frequency. With this purpose, computer simulations are carried out for a market that consists of day-ahead trading and real-time trading. The day-ahead mechanism trades energy quantities in such a way that flexible demand can be shifted to balance inflexible supply, and the real-time mechanism trades energy in such a way that flexible loads cover deviations from the day-ahead settlement. The results illustrate that the Ethereum platform is sufficiently scalable, allowing to manage a local energy market with a large number of participants and a high trading frequency.

AB In a bid to stamp out fraudulent crime, there is increased pressure on individuals to provide evidence that they possess a 'real' identity. Counterfeiting and fake identities have reduced confidence in traditional paper documentation as proof of identity, this has created a demand for an intelligent digital alternative. Recent government implementations and identity trends have also improved the popularity of digital forms of identification.
   Authentication of identity is a salient issue in the current climate where identity theft through record duplication is on the rise. Identity resolution techniques have proven effective in filtering duplicated and fake records in identity management systems. These techniques have been further improved by the implementation of machine learning techniques which are capable of revealing patterns and links that have formerly gone undetected. Research has also suggested that incorporating non-standard attributes in the form of social contextual data can increase the efficiency and success-rate of these fraud detection methods.
   In the digital age where individuals are creating large digital footprints, online accounts and activities can prove to be a valuable source of information that may contribute to 'proof' that an asserted identity is genuine. Online social contextual data - or 'Digital identities' - pertaining to real people are built over time and bolstered by associated accounts, relationships and attributes. This data is difficult to fake and therefore may have the capacity to provide proof of a 'real' identity.
   This paper outlines the design and initial development of a solution that utilizes data sourced from an individual's digital footprint to assess the likelihood that it pertains to a 'real' identity. This is achieved through application of machine learning and Bayesian probabilistic modelling techniques. Where identity sources are considered reliable, a secure and intelligent digital identification artefact will be created. This artefact will emulate a blockchain-inspired ledger and may subsequently be used to prove identity in place of traditional paper documentation.

In this paper, we introduce the experience of the development of SWIM Registry Brazil, which comprises the study of the architecture, components, services and data accessing. In order to encourage consumers and providers to participate in the SWIM community, we developed a prototype of SWIM Registry Demonstration for the Brazilian ATM society. We propose a model based on Blockchain for managing services currently provided by Brazilian ATM in order to certificate operations which are performed by consumers, authorities and involved stakeholders. The proposed model is expected to provide services for SWIM Registry with integrity, efficiency, security and authenticity, which are fundamental for the proper operation of Brazilian aviation system.

TI Smart Contracts as the (new) Power of the Powerless? The Stakes for
   Consumers
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB The success of smart contracts based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) springs from their potential to secure contract performance when traditional legal enforcement remedies are not practical or too costly. EU policymakers and regulators have struggled for years to facilitate the enforcement of consumer rights while reducing transaction costs for businesses. The article argues that smart contracts can be a viable tool to address such a challenge. By virtue of their self-executing and tamper-proof character, smart contracts are suited to substantially reduce transaction costs in B2C relationships. So far, several legal scholars have raised concerns regarding both smart contracts inability to reflect relational aspects of contract governance and the augmented complexity generated by the translation of an agreement into computer code. Building upon the extant literature on the topic, the article explains why these problems can be overcome when it comes to consumer rights that are standardized and easily verifiable. Thus, smart contracts will likely prove suitable for specific industries, such as the transport sector. The article concludes that policy makers and regulators shall take the lead by testing, with a sector-specific approach, smart contracts ability to improve the consumer protection toolbox.

AB Blockchain technology has brought a huge paradigm shift in multiple industries, by integrating distributed ledger, smart contracts and consensus protocol under the same roof. Notable applications of blockchain include cryptocurrencies and large-scale multi-party transaction management systems. The latter fits very well into the domain of manufacturing and supply chain management for Integrated Circuits (IC), which, despite several advanced technologies, is vulnerable to malicious practices, such as overproduction, IP piracy and deleterious design modification to gain unfair advantages. To combat these threats, researchers have proposed several ideas like hardware metering, design obfuscation, split manufacturing and watermarking. In this paper, we show, how these issues can be complementarily dealt with using blockchain technology coupled with identity-based encryption and physical unclonable functions, for improved resilience against certain adversarial motives. As part of our proposed blockchain protocol, titled 'BLIC', we propose an authentication mechanism to secure both active and passive IC transactions, and a composite consensus protocol designed for IC supply chains. We also present studies on the security, scalability, privacy and anonymity of the BLIC protocol.

AB This paper presents a trust model that aggregates multiple sources of information, such as: testimonies, context, social information, preconception, reputation, and proposes a new data structure, called Dossier. The aim is to raise the success rate that consumer agents have when contracting provider agents. To reach this objective we make two hypotheses: (i) every consumer agent is able to measure and inform the quality of a service they receive from a provider agent; (ii) the Dossier is a data structure that allows the evaluated agent himself to keep locally the history of feedbacks received without modification or omission that benefits him The model-that uses the Dossier structure-reduces some weak points of trust models that rely on the direct interaction between provider and consumer agents (direct tract) or those that rely on testimony obtained from client agents (indirect trust). The Dossier model allows us effectively to use the agent approach to build decentralized IT solutions, where control and data-of every application encapsulated in an agent-can actually be distributed logically and physically. The comparative analysis showed that the Dossier model has a behavior equivalent to or superior to the considered models (FIRE, TRAVOS, MARSH and Central) and that such a model can make the agents more efficient in choosing their partners. The reason for this is that the reputation of a given service provider agent is based on the reputation it has among the totality of consumer agents that used its services.

AB Proof-of-work (PoW) is used as the consensus mechanism in most cryptocurrencies. PoW-based puzzles play an important part in the operation and security of a cryptocurrency, but come at a considerable energy cost. One approach to the problem of energy wastage is to find ways to build PoW schemes from valuable computational problems. This work proposes calibration of public key cryptographic systems as a suitable source of PoW puzzles. We describe the properties needed to adapt public key cryptosystems as PoW functions suitable for decentralised cryptocurrencies and provide a candidate example.

AB Modern Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, gain more and more popularity in the blockchain community and their adoption has already been started. Combining smart-contract execution with TEEs promises efficient solutions for protecting data privacy in distributed ledgers, as an alternative to much more costly cryptographic protocols.
   This paper describes practical challenges that arise from the combination of smart contracts with TEEs. In particular, we discuss existing solutions and their conceptional differences of on-chain and off-chain execution followed by technical challenges on attestation, key management, and non-deterministic execution.

AB We study key leakage in the context of cryptocurrencies. First, we consider the problem of explicit key leakage occurring on opensource intelligence platforms. To do this, we monitor the Pastebin feed from Sep 2017-Mar 2018 to find exposed secret Bitcoin keys, revealing that attackers could have stolen 22.40 BTC worth roughly $178,000 given current exchange rates. Then, we focus on implicit key leakage by exploiting the wrong usage of cryptographic primitives and scan Bitcoin's blockchain for ECDSA nonce reuse. We systematically outline how an attacker can use duplicate r values to leak nonces and secret keys, which goes beyond the simple case where the same nonce and the same key have been used in conjunction more than once. Our results show that ECDSA nonce reuse has been a recurring problem in the Bitcoin ecosystem and has already been exploited by attackers. In fact, an attacker could have exploited nonce reuse to steal 412.80 BTC worth roughly $3.3 million.

AB Nowadays, vehicles odometer fraud is becoming a growing problem internationally, and is costing European consumers between (sic)5.6 to (sic)9.6 billion per year. This is partly due to the lack of unified vehicles life-cycle management, and to the fact that vehicles data are currently spread across multiple stakeholders that do not trust each other or collaborate together. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-backed Vehicles Data and Processes Ledger framework to streamline the management of vehicles life-cycle and data history, and hence to provide more transparency and collaborations between the involved stakeholders. The architecture and lessons learned from the first implementation phase are discussed, followed by future research challenges.

AB In 2038 we have lived though a decade during which the world's global computational infrastructure undermined privacy and trust in virtually every aspect of our lives. The problems were seen far in advance, but it was commonplace belief that a combination of cryptography and more distributed responsibilty in systems-blockchains for everything, and all hail the cloud'-would together restore what had been lost in the first decades of the 21st century. As it turned out, it was these very technologies that ended up destroying the privacy and trust we had left.
   In this review, we argue that the mistake collectively made was to think of privacy and trust as technological problems, when in fact they are properties of social and political systems. If we are to recover from what we call the BlockCloud Apocalypse, humans and machines are going to have to figure out how to build systems that support privacy and trust in society, rather than attempt to replace it with trust in technical validations. We propose a return to trust in humanitarian motives rather than technological supremacy.

AB Distributed Ledger (DL) has gained huge attention in the last years and will shift the conduction of business in the future. Until today, because of the great dynamics in the field a systematic approach to structure and define the field of DL does not exist. This led to a heterogeneous landscape of DL definitions and thus, misleading discussions.
   This paper gives a systematic overview of principles relevant to understand and structure the DL field. Furthermore, based on this it describes DL concepts and shows examples of protocols. The result can then be used for further research but also as a basis for successful collaborations in the field of DL.

TI Developing a Cryptocurrency Assessment Framework: Function over Form
SO LEDGER
AB The rise of cryptocurrency as a new sui generis asset class creates a need for a new classification scheme to cover the wide range of functionality for which tokens can be used. By differentiating tokens based on their functional attributes, cryptocurrency tokens can be categorised into crypto-transaction tokens (which act as a cash substitute); crypto-fuel tokens (which underpin generic blockchain applications); and crypto-voucher tokens (which can be exchanged for a predefined asset). This classification is applied to identify important issues when considering whether to participate in a cryptocurrency system, such as the impact of potential forks, token supply expectations and the level of dependence on a few operators (entity-dependence). For crypto-transaction tokens (and crypto-fuel tokens if used in a similar or overlapping role) it shows the importance of the token being seen as a "better" form of money. For crypto-fuel tokens, the popularity of blockchain applications and the utility of the crypto-fuel system in application development is vital. For crypto-voucher tokens, the value of the underlying asset, the token's exchangeability for that asset and the importance of a digital representation should be considered by participants. The interplay between fundamentals and speculation as drivers of price is considered.

AB People are increasingly connected to the Internet through their smartphones and each of these mobile devices has a wide range of sensors. The users themselves can be asked short questions about what they see. This crowdsensing has the potential to improve our daily lives by providing actual data about the environment and the use of services. However, there are significant obstacles to user participation like resource consumption and privacy concerns. There is a need for incentives to motivate the users.
   In this paper, we propose a tamper-proof incentive scheme for a mobile crowdsensing system that supports open sensing, with both automated and manual participation. We implemented a prototype of the system with server components and a mobile application. The proposed incentive scheme implements a tit-for tat approach: positive user participation is rewarded with points that are stored in a shared record. This incentive ledger uses a Blockchain so that it can be trusted by every participant. The evaluation results show that the proposed scheme is practical and can be used to motivate increased participation in crowdsensing.

AB Some recent trends in distributed intelligent systems rely extensively on agent-based approaches. The so-called Multi Agent Systems (MAS) are taking over the management of sensitive data on behalf of their producers and users (e.g., medical records, financial investment, energy market). Therefore, trusted interactions are needed more than ever, while accountability and transparency among the agents seem crucial characteristics to be achieved. To do so, recent trends advocate the use of blockchain technologies (BCT) in MAS. The blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that can execute programmable transaction logic, and provides a shared, immutable, and transparent append only register of all the actions happening in the network. Although a few theoretical approaches have already been proposed, the quest for such a system consolidating BCT and MAS to guarantee privacy, scalability, transparency, and efficiency continues. This paper presents a reconciling system including BCT within the dynamics of a MAS. Such a system aims at (i) building a solid ground for trusted interactions and (ii) enabling more characterizing feature-based and trustworthy ways of computing agent reputation. The system has been tested in four scenarios with different configurations (regular executions and involving down-agents or malicious behaviors). Finally, the paper summarizes and discusses the experience gained, argues about the strategic choice of binding MAS and BCT, and presents some future challenges.

AB The multi-agent framework is a well-known approach to realize distributed intelligent systems. Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly employed in safety- and information-critical domains (e.g., eHealth, cyber-physical systems, financial services, and energy market). Therefore, these systems need to be equipped with mechanisms to ensure transparency and the trustworthiness of the behaviors of their components. Trust can be achieved by employing reputation-based mechanisms. Nevertheless, the existing methods are still unable to fully guarantee the desired accountability and transparency. Aligned with the recent trends, advocating the distribution of trust to avoid the risks of having a single point of failure of the system, this work extends existing efforts on combining blockchain technologies (BCT) and MAS. To attain a trusted environment, we provide the architecture and implementation of a system that allows the agents to interact with each other and enables tracking how their reputation changes after every interaction. Agents reputations are computed transparently using smart contracts. Immutable distributed ledger stores reputation values, as well as services and their evaluations to ensure trustworthy interactions between the agents. We also developed a graphical interface to test different scenarios of interactions between the agents. Finally, we summarize and discuss the experience gained and explain the strategic choices when binding MAS and BCT.

AB One of the main issues in service collaborations among business partners is the possible lack of trust among them. A promising approach to cope with this issue is leveraging on blockchain technology by encoding with smart contracts the business process workflow. This brings the benefits of trust decentralization, transparency, and accountability of the service composition process. However, data in the blockchain are public, implying thus serious consequences on confidentiality and privacy. Moreover, smart contracts can access data outside the blockchain only through Oracles, which might pose new confidentiality risks if no assumptions are made on their trustworthiness. For these reasons, in this paper, we are interested in investigating how to ensure data confidentiality during business process execution on blockchain even in the presence of an untrusted Oracle.

AB Permissioned Blockchain (PBC) has become a prevalent data structure to ensure that the records are immutable and secure. However, PBC still has significant challenges before it can be realized in different applications. One of such challenges is the overhead of the communication which is required to execute the Byzantine Agreement (BA) protocol that is needed for consensus building. As such, it may not be feasible to implement PBC for resource constrained environments such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this paper, we assess the communication overhead of running BA in an IoT environment that consists of wireless nodes (e.g., Raspberry PIs) with meshing capabilities. As the the packet loss ratio is significant and makes BA unfeasible to scale, we propose a network coding based approach that will reduce the packet overhead and minimize the consensus completion time of the BA. Specifically, various network coding approaches are designed as a replacement to TCP protocol which relies on unicasting and acknowledgements. The evaluation on a network of Raspberry PIs demonstrates that our approach can significantly improve scalability making BA feasible for medium size IoT networks.

AB This study proposes a privacy preserving Blockchain-Based Ticketing Service (BB Tickets), which stores information about events and related tickets in the blockchain network. As the blockchain technologies can ensure information integrity, ticket buyers can use the data stored in the blockchain network to ensure the authenticity of the purchased tickets and to resolve related disputes. Furthermore, the Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) scheme is utilized in the proposed system to protect user privacy. Therefore, this study contributes to providing a privacy-preserving means for users to enjoy the reliable ticketing service provided by the blockchain technologies.

AB In this study, we utilize a blockchain network as the underlying communication architecture to construct an ISO/IEC 15408-2 compliant security auditing system. The proposed system is an evolutionary paradigm not only seamlessly integrating the advantages, i.e. de-centralization, robustness and tamper-resistance, of the blockchain network, but fulfilling the critical auditing requirements identified by ISO/IEC 15408-2. Versatile intelligent applications, including IoT (Internet of Things) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) robots, are highly suitable to adopt our security auditing system.

AB To prevent users from downloading and installing malicious smartphone applications, several countries and organizations have developed security requirements for smartphone applications and associated vetting systems. Certified third parties can inspect whether an application satisfies applicable security requirements and issue inspection reports to notify users of potential risks. However, currently there is no standard method for users to obtain inspection results. Furthermore, as the advances of hacking techniques, a inspecter may discover that an application is vulnerable to a new type of attack and wish to notify application users immediately. To address the issue, this study proposes a Smart Contract-based Investigation Report Management framework for smartphone applications security (SCIRM) to enable smartphone application users to obtain security inspection reports of interested applications with smart contracts. Benefiting from blockchain technology, users can obtain historical inspection reports of an application and verify the integrity of the reports. In addition, this study utilizes smart contract technology to implement the interfaces so that smart contracts will enforce the related actions automatically. This study can hopefully contribute to enabling users to adopt appropriate countermeasures to potential application security risks as users can obtain up-to-dated security information about applications timely.

AB Blockchain normalizes applications that run on the internet through the standardization of decentralized data structure, computational requirements and trust in transactions. This new standard has now spawned hundreds of legitimate internet applications in addition to the cryptocurrency revolution. This next frontier that standardizes internet applications will dramatically increase productivity to levels never seen before, especially when applied to Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The blockchain framework relies on cryptographic private keys to sign digital data as its foundational principle. Without the security of private keys to sign data blocks, there can be no trust in blockchain. Central storage of these keys for managing IoT machines and users, while convenient to implement, will be highly detrimental to the assumed safety and security of this next frontier. In this paper, we will introduce decentralized and device agnostic cryptographic signing solutions suitable for securing users and machines in blockchain and IoT applications.

AB currently, government identification systems are still underdeveloped. The government has adopted computer technology to serve the policy of Thailand 4.0. Thai national ID still segmented and distributed between government agencies and has no centralization, and it brings bad experience to the users because each service must be registered and the users have to remember the username and password for every service. We demonstrated Thailand national Digital ID Framework based on Blockchain (NIDBC) to help improve digital identity government service to simple single sign-on and kept preserving privacy by providing personal information to service only when users grant permission for each service. In addition, the system is secure because the data is distributed to each node, making the attackers hard to attack or edit information. The security properties of the proposed protocol have been verified using Scyther tool and are presented here with results.

AB Inspired by the blockchain architecture and existing Merkle tree based signature schemes, we propose BPQS, an extensible post-quantum (PQ) resistant digital signature scheme best suited to blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). One of the unique characteristics of the protocol is that it can take advantage of application-specific chain/graph structures in order to decrease key generation, signing and verification costs as well as signature size. Compared to recent improvements in the field, BPQS outperforms existing hash-based algorithms when a key is reused for reasonable numbers of signatures, while it supports a fallback mechanism to allow for a practically unlimited number of signatures if required. We provide an open source implementation of the scheme and benchmark it.

AB The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has opened up plethora of opportunities for smart networking and connected applications. The large distribution of IoT devices within a finite geographical area and the pervasiveness of wireless networking presents an opportunity for such devices to collaborate. This paper proposes the idea of opportunistic collaboration among mobile IoT devices to share their services and excess computing resources. Opportunistic collaboration among devices over wireless networking requires proper coordination and agreements among the devices in a purely distributed manner. To facilitate the distributive collaboration, we propose a decentralized architecture design using blockchain technology. Through experimental evaluation of a prototype collaborative mobile-IoT system involving RaspberryPis and a Dell IoT edge gateway, we show that our proposed distributed collaborative approach is feasible and comparable to a non-collaborative edge- computing approach from a latency perspective.

AB This article explores the potential probability of blockchain technology in assisting enhanced application for ridesharing services. The development of the sharing economy brings numerous novel ideas and generates many innovative businesses. However, the wide range of the sharing economy also causes disputes and questions, including labor, organizations, and regulations. Blockchain technology (hereafter blockchain) can facilitate virtual and physical networking symbiosis. This situation would motivate a new model of governance, namely, the bottom-up organization. Therefore, the blockchain would push governances and citizens to reorganize current complicated systems. In this work, we demonstrate SmaRi to achieve a decentralized transaction system combined with the block-chain as our case. Our proposed system provides users with automated execution and immutable record and distributes more decisionmaking power from centralized organization to users. These measures may fulfill the core value of the sharing economy through peer-to-peer exchanges. Furthermore, we illustrate how SmaRi can be combined with current management systems. By linking with the original system, SmaRi can establish comprehensive functions quickly. In this work, we can expect modern society to become closer to future smart cities.

AB The perennial shortage of capital for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups is a critical issue in the policies of many governments. However, due to an atmosphere of public mistrust toward financial systems, governments throughout the world have exerted effort to tighten regulations of financial activities after the 2007-2008 global financial crisis. Thus, SMEs and start-ups face increased difficulty in raising capital through traditional financing channels. In this study, we explore how blockchain technology could be applied to capital markets through an angel fund. Blockchain data structure and its consensus algorithm create trust among untrusted entities. This condition enables untrusted parties to interact without the involvement of middlemen, thereby reducing transaction costs and promoting efficiency and transparency of transactions. Furthermore, smart contracts deployed on the blockchain are used to reduce agency problems caused by third-party matching service providers. Based on these ideas, this paper proposes a distributed angel fund matching platform based on blockchain.

AB The distributed consensus problem has been extensively studied in the last four decades as an important problem in distributed systems. Recent advances in decentralized consensus and blockchain technology, however, arose from a disparate model and gave rise to disjoint knowledge-base and techniques than those in the classical consensus research. In this paper we make a case for bridging these two seemingly disparate approaches in order to help transfer the lessons learned from the classical distributed consensus world to the blockchain world and vice versa. To this end, we draw parallels between blockchain consensus and a classical consensus protocol, Paxos. We also survey prominent approaches to improving the throughput and providing instant irreversibility to blockchain consensus and show analogies to the techniques from classical consensus protocols. Finally, inspired by the central role formal methods played in the success of classical consensus research, we suggest more extensive use of formal methods in modeling the blockchains and smartcontracts.

AB Blockchains such as those used by the Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies provide a global, observable record of all transactions and associated data. Analyzing blockchain data is useful for tasks such as detecting fraudulent activities, studying the use and growth of the system, and understanding its levels of anonymity and traceability. Such analysis is challenging due to the high volume and rapidly changing characteristics of popular blockchains. In particular, online (soft real-time) analysis of blockchains requires methods that adapt organically to changes in the data. This paper describes such a method based on self-organizing maps and reports on experiments using the Bitcoin blockchain data.

AB In this paper, we focus on the design of consensus algorithms for permission-based blockchains, i.e., private blockchains. In most consensus algorithms, blocks are proposed by a specific role called "leader". hi this paper, we introduce a new role called "witness" to supervise the leader. The presence of the witness facilitates the design of the consensus algorithm. We propose a witness-based consensus algorithm that guarantees safety and liveness. We implemented this consensus algorithm on Go Ethereum. The experimental result shows that in a blockchain where four nodes participate in the consensus process, we can achieve a throughput of 1000 transactions per second (TPS). Even if these four nodes are located on different continents, and one of them is faulty, we can still achieve a throughput of 300 TPS. Finally, we find that during the experiment, a significant portion of time (>50%) is spent on activities other than the consensus task. The result suggests that to further increase the throughput of a private blockchain, the consensus task and non-consensus activities should be considered jointly.

AB Blockchain technology has been evolved in the last years and its area of utilization has been increased, also. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between organizations using the above mentioned technology and value, to identify the general and specific sources of value, respectively. The evaluation of value perceptions is a long-term research while the blockchain-based projects are very recent. Therefore, the value creation and value added concepts are very helpful for start-ups, entrepreneurs as well as stakeholders. Considering the untraditional management of such organization the paper presents the traditional approach of value- created and added and adapts them in the area of information technology through the specific instrument of these businesses- smart contract. Also, how other aspects like decentralized management or virtual coin could develop value for business are discussed. The outcome is that the paper offers some conclusions which could be helpful for investors but, more important for those who want to develop projects using this new technology.

AB Since the proxy re-encryption has the limitation of distributed applications and the security risk of collusion attacks in semi-trusted distributed environments (e.g. cloud computing), the novel definition of threshold proxy re-encryption is proposed based on secret sharing and proxy re-encryption. According to the definition, the threshold proxy re-encryption scheme can be flexibly created with the standard cryptographic prototype. An efficient, secure, and implementable unidirectional threshold proxy re-encryption scheme is constructed by the combination of Shamir's secret sharing, and is proved secure by using the intractability of discrete logarithms. This paper presents a consortium blockchain access permission scheme, which is built on the threshold proxy re-encryption scheme. When a new node joins a consortium blockchain, an access permission is achieved by the agreement on other existing nodes, instead of a centralized CA.

AB Energy Internet provides important support to power transmission and substation distribution links, security is particularly significant. However, access authentication centralized to the certification center has brought great pressure on computing and communications. In this paper, a distributed authentication scheme for the energy Internet is proposed based on the blockchain technology, which is decentralized and undeniable. A PBFT consensus mechanism is implemented with the Shamir threshold secret sharing mechanism. Experiments show that the scheme can effectively improve the concurrent access efficiency of Energy Internet terminals.

AB To solve the credibility and supervision lacking problem in the OTC warehouse receipt trading system, a scheme of using smart contract on the blockchain to implement the OTC warehouse receipt trading system is presented. As a distributed ledger, blockchain has the advantages of decentralization, irreversibility and trustworthiness. The warehouse receipt transaction data is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring its safety and credibility. Smart contract is automatically executed code stored on the blockchain, it can directly control the transaction of digital assets. No participant can control and tamper it before the contract is lapsed. In the process of using the Ethereum smart contract to realize warehouse receipt transactions, consensus is reached by the PBFT consensus algorithm, Since the trusted third-party is not needed, the lack of supervision problem is solved. This paper introduces the application of blockchain and smart contract to the OTC warehouse receipt trading system. It includes the design of smart contracts, the verification of smart contracts security. This paper also verifies the feasibility of designing smart contracts by using the instance of listed transactions.

AB The management and utilization of spectrum resources has always been an important issue. The data of radio signals from the time domain, frequency domain, and space domain is tremendous. The current spectrum databases are mainly centralized and the disaster recovery capacity of centralized database is insufficient. In the future, cognitive radio network (CRN) will be the development trend of mobile communications. The access to the spectrum database by a large number of cognitive radio (CR) terminals and the uploading of spectrum detection data by the spectrum detection terminal in real time will exert tremendous pressure on CRN. This paper proposes use of distributed spectrum databases instead of centralized database architectures in the spectrum big data to improve the fault tolerance of spectrum databases. Multi-node collaborative electromagnetic detection method with source parameter is proposed to replace the traditional wide-band energy detection method. The traditional spectrum database stores spectrum data with energy values, and the redundancy of data is really high. We propose to store the instantaneous parameters of signal source with the structure of blockchain. The timestamp is used as the link ID of the block to connect each block end-to-end, and a distributed spectrum database is established. With the timestamp as a unique identifier, the nodes locally interact with real-time detection data. Secondary user (SU) achieve the complete electromagnetic spectrum data by access each node. SUs can analyze the electromagnetic spectrum environment, and formulate appropriate strategies for rapid dynamic spectrum access (DSA).

AB This paper proposes a blockchain federated mediator architecture to support querying and cooperation activities. Due to the data and programs are crossing various blockchain systems, leveraging the information poses challenges especially for the reason of heterogeneity introduced by the information systems. The mediation services are expected to play an important role in helping automated processes to access the heterogeneous information from various chains. While there are no answers from a mediator because of the unsatisfication of search criteria for a single object, the mediators are able to collaborate with each other in order to make a composite answer by grouping a set of objects. In this paper, we introduce such a mediator-based architecture on blockchains and its implementation from the industry perspective.

AB Turing-completeness of smart contract languages in blockchain systems is often associated with a variety of language features (such as loops). On the contrary, we show that Turing-completeness of a blockchain system can be achieved through unwinding the recursive calls between multiple transactions and blocks instead of using a single one. We prove it by constructing a simple universal Turing machine using a small set of language features in the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, with explicitly given relations between input and output transaction states. Neither unbounded loops nor possibly infinite validation time are needed in this approach.

AB Blockchain technology has become almost as famous for incidents involving security breaches as for its innovative potential. We shed light on the prevalence and nature of these incidents through a database structured using the STIX format. Apart from OPSEC-related incidents, we find that the nature of many incidents is specific to blockchain technology. Two categories stand out: smart contracts, and techno-economic protocol incentives. For smart contracts, we propose to use recent advances in software testing to find flaws before deployment. For protocols, we propose the PRESTO framework that allows us to compare different protocols within a five-dimensional framework.

Furthermore, by using the DIFF method, the user can effectively modify the stored data with the lower transmission cost and delay.

AB Various types of cryptocurrency e.g. BitCoin, Ethereum, Zcash, and more, are broadly accepted and used in many different forms of business but a typical problem that the cryptocurrency users are faced with is the delay of coin transfer. For example, it takes several hours for BitCoin and several minutes for Ethereum. These cryptocurrencies also consume a high quantity of electricity for transaction validation. Even though there currently is a type of cryptocurrencies, Ripple, that can be quickly transferred in 4 seconds but still it is a closed system with an owner, not a public cryptocurrency. Similarly, an algorithm "Proof of Stake" used by new coins that are more energy-saving but several problems are still found including (1) 51% attack, (2) a richer with more coins gains higher rewards, and (3) a problematic node for block validation that is not currently active. This research presents a model of an open cryptocurrency system that is able to transfer a coin within 3 seconds in which an algorithm called "Random-Checkers Proof of Stake" (RCPoS) was proposed to randomly select the inspectors for validation processes which can avoid those three problems of the Proof of Stake.

AB Bitcoin is the first secure decentralized electronic currency system. However, it is known to be inefficient due to its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm and has the potential hazard of double spending. In this paper, we aim to reduce the probability of double spending by decreasing the probability of consecutive winning. We first formalize a PoW-based decentralized secure network model in order to present a quantitative analysis. Next, to resolve the risk of double spending, we propose the personalized difficulty adjustment (PDA) mechanism which modifies the difficulty of each participant such that those who win more blocks in the past few rounds have a smaller probability to win in the next round. To analyze the performance of the PDA mechanism, we observe that the system can be modeled by a high-order Markov chain. Finally, we show that PDA effectively decreases the probability of consecutive winning and results in a more trustworthy PoW-based system.

AB Smart contracts are essential in implementing and automating transactions in a blockchain network. The translation of existing business rules on transactions to a smart contract is challenging and time consuming. These types of constraints are often re-used among different contracts in a given application area. Automatic generation of smart contracts can reduce the level of expertise required for, along with the time and cost incurred in, specifying them. In this paper, we provide a novel framework for auto-generating smart contracts by enabling seamless translation of constraints encoded in a knowledge representation to blockchain requirements. Our framework uses ontologies and semantic rules to encode domain-specific knowledge and then leverages the structure of abstract syntax trees to incorporate the required constraints. We successfully demonstrate the functionality and effectiveness of our method in two different applications: translating eligibility criteria for clinical trials and car rentals.

AB IoT data economy is an emerging concept since sensing data are widely applied in various IoT services. To maintain the stability of data economic system, this paper proposes the Reliable IoT Data Economic System (RIDES) to provide IoT data a reliable, automatic, and intelligent trading environment. Applying the smart contract technique, IoT data in RIDES can be automatically traded without human intervention. As the trading procedure is performed based on blockchain, all transactions can be protected against tampering. Also, the RIDES provides the Smart Decision Making Module for users to develop practical pricing strategies. Thus, a seller can derive a price with the highest expected revenue for its data and a buyer can purchase its desired data referring to cost-performance ratio or data owner's trustworthiness. Even if malicious sellers cheat buyers, the latter can invoke trade dispute procedure to refund their payment, which makes the trading environment more reliable. As the blockchain-based operations usually cost much, the RIDES adopts the edge computing architecture to alleviate the burdens of IoT devices. Finally, the RIDES is implemented in IoT environments. The case study demonstrates that the transactions on IoT data can be performed correctly by RIDES.

In her research, the author applied Porter's 5 forces model as a theoretical framework for the analysis in the area of innovation and technology in logistics. The study uses the deduction method. This is a conceptual paper based on the analysis of secondary materials, i.e., examples of innovative logistics solutions, reports of research agencies and consulting companies, and literature studies. The results of the analysis show that we are dealing with the digital transformation of the logistics service industry (not digital destruction). Technologies like sensors, robots, automation, cloud computing, data analysis, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, digital twins or blockchain technology supplement but not replace the real world of logistics by providing customers with higher logistics service value.

AB We investigate the impact of how a cryptocurrency mining system can affect the power consumption of mobile devices. Specifically we look at CoinHive, a cryptocurrency miner and associated mining pool targeting the Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency. CoinHive distributes a JavaScript-based miner to webpages where visitors run the script and provide computing power to the web host's CoinHive account. Ideally, hosting JavaScript-based cryptocurrency miners provides alternatives to using ad-networks as a source of website revenue. While some users may not oppose an energy for advertisement trade-off, it may be less palatable to mobile users concerned with battery life. Our initial studies have revealed that, at a minimum, running the normally distributed JavaScript-based miner increases the power draw of a Samsung Galaxy S4 by about 5 fold. Under certain circumstances, the power draw can increase to eleven-fold. We illustrate these findings by comparing them with various normal use benchmarks and with a variety of different ad-enabled webpages.

AB Atomic multicast is an important building block in the architecture of scalable and highly available services. Atomic multicast reliably propagates and orders messages addressed to one or more groups of processes. Despite the large body of literature on atomic multicast, existing protocols target benign failures. This paper presents ByzCast, the first Byzantine Fault-Tolerant atomic multicast. Byzantine Fault Tolerance has become increasingly appealing as services can be deployed in inexpensive hardware (e.g., cloud environments) and new applications (e.g., blockchain) become more sensitive to malicious behavior. ByzCast has two important characteristics: it was designed to use existing BFT abstractions and it scales with the number of groups, for messages addressed to a single group. We discuss the design of ByzCast and how it can be optimized for particular workloads. Besides proposing a novel atomic multicast protocol, we extensively assess its performance experimentally.

AB The increased penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) on the distribution network creates local challenges in balancing consumption and generation. To coordinate the roll-out and the operation of DERs, distribution-level energy markets have been proposed, but there are currently few tools for simulating the operation of DERs in these proposed markets. We present a framework which utilizes a grid co-simulation platform (Mosaik) to simulation DER operation, while simulating market clearing operations with a blockchain network (Ethereum). The use of blockchains, an emerging technology for decentralized computing and data storage, allows us to model secure decentralized execution of market clearing functions and payment processes. By unifying simulation of market clearing rules and the physical grid, we are able to ensure that economic incentives are aligned with physical constraints, helping facilitate the development of more effective distributed energy markets. We demonstrate the use of this new simulation platform on a small feeder, for which a market mechanism to incentivize DER integration is explored.

AB With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies, people find more and more blockchain applications in the IoT domain. While it is reasonable that IoT systems use hierarchical network structures, their sheer large scales may lead to hundreds or even thousands of non-leaf nodes, which may serve as full nodes when participating in IoT blockchains. From IoT blockchain design perspective, it is important to understand the scalability of the energy consumption feature of IoT blockchains. In our research we have collected real-world data that reflect the energy consumption features of several consensus algorithms of blockchain. In this work-in-progress paper, we report our results based on linear regression models. These models provide reference estimations of the energy consumption impact in designing blockchains for IoT systems.

AB Blockchain technology has the potential to decentralise many traditionally centralised systems. However, scalability remains a key challenge. A horizontally scalable solution, where performance increases by adding more nodes, would move blockchain systems one step closer to ubiquitous use. We design a novel blockchain system called CHECO. Each node in our system maintains a personal hash chain, which only stores transactions that the node is involved in. A consensus is reached on special blocks called checkpoint blocks rather than on all transactions. Checkpoint blocks are effectively a hash pointer to the personal hash chains; thus a single checkpoint block may represent an arbitrarily large set of transactions. We introduce a validation protocol so that any node can check the validity of any transaction. Since transaction and validation protocols are point-to-point, we achieve horizontal scalability. We analytically evaluate our system and show a number of highly desirable correctness properties such as consensus on the validity of transactions. Further, we give a free and open-source implementation of CHECO and evaluate it experimentally. Our results show a strong indication of horizontal scalability.

AB Blockchain-driven technologies are considered disruptive because of the availability of dis-intermediated, censorship-resistant and tamper-proof digital platforms of distributed trust. Among these technologies, smart contract platforms have the potential to take over functions usually done by intermediaries like banks, escrow or legal services. In this paper, we introduce a novel protocol aiming to execute smart contracts as part of a blockchain transaction validation. We enable extensions in the execution of smart contracts while guaranteeing their privacy, correctness and verifiability. Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented, since no communication between participants is requested, and contract validations do not imply the re-execution of the code by all the nodes in the network. However, proofs of correct execution are stored on the blockchain and can be verified by multiple parties. Our solution is based on programming tools which optimize the time execution and the required memory while preserving the embedded functionality.

AB The mF2C project is building an open, secure and decentralized management platform for coordinating resource sharing between connected devices in the fog-to-cloud (F2C) environment. Safeguarding information security and privacy in mF2C is a considerable challenge given the heterogeneous and autonomous nature of devices spanning the F2C spectrum. The recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) raised the stake further by defining stringent security and privacy requirements on the processing of personal information. IaaS and PaaS providers falling in scope must demonstrate that they have implemented reasonable security mechanisms to ensure compliance or face significant financial penalties. In this paper, we present a prototype JAVA-based security library that addresses some of the data security and privacy requirements of mF2C and GDPR. The prototype employs a PKI-based trust model to facilitate authentication and authorization. It uses policy to ensure data privacy and cryptography to deliver data confidentiality, integrity and non-repudiation. We also outline plans to enhance the mF2C security infrastructure with data protection functionalities from the security library and to leverage blockchain technology to augment mF2C security and data protection capabilities.

AB Purchase management of medical supplies is a critical and important process that affects the services provision quality. Nonetheless, it is facing a growing pressure to provide visibility and traceability of the purchase, to reduce fraud, to improve flexibility and to ensure communication between everyone involved. Currently, private health institutions in Peru choose to implant different software products within the same company with restricted visibility access to other concerned parties and based on information from a single source. A new alternative is Blockchain technology, since it provides a single source of shared truth to all participants and ensures that the information cannot be altered, thus offering high levels of transparency that, together with IoT technology, creates not only visibility about where things are, but also traceability, showing the current state of things.

AB In blockchain-based systems, malicious behaviour can be detected using auditable information in transactions managed by distributed ledgers. Besides cryptocurrency, blockchain technology has recently been used for other applications, such as file storage. However, most of existing blockchain-based file storage systems can not revoke a user efficiently when multiple users have access to the same file that is encrypted. Actually, they need to update file encryption keys and distribute new keys to remaining users, which significantly increases computation and bandwidth overheads. In this work, we propose a blockchain and proxy re-encryption based design for encrypted file sharing that brings a distributed access control and data management. By combining blockchain with proxy re-encryption, our approach not only ensures confidentiality and integrity of files, but also provides a scalable key management mechanism for file sharing among multiple users. Moreover, by storing encrypted files and related keys in a distributed way, our method can resist collusion attacks between revoked users and distributed proxies.

AB In this article, we quantitatively analyze how the term "fake news" is being shaped in news media in recent years. We study the perception and the conceptualization of this term in the traditional media using eight years of data collected from news outlets based in 20 countries. Our results not only corroborate previous indications of a high increase in the usage of the expression "fake news", but also show contextual changes around this expression after the United States presidential election of 2016. Among other results, we found changes in the related vocabulary, in the mentioned entities, in the surrounding topics and in the contextual polarity around the term "fake news", suggesting that this expression underwent a change in perception and conceptualization after 2016. These outcomes expand the understandings on the usage of the term "fake news", helping to comprehend and more accurately characterize this relevant social phenomenon linked to misinformation and manipulation.

AB With the diffusion of smart metering devices and the increasing trend in renewable energy investment Ill, the electrical grids arc rapidly changing towards the adoption of decentralized energy networks in which consumers can be also producers (i.e. prosumers). The increased use of renewable and distributed generation is leading the development of Smart Grid and microgrid technologies. In this context new business opportunities can be developed provided that new critical issues for the traditional operators, introduced by decentralization, are addressed properly. As example, grid imbalances can generate Reverse Power Flow (RPF) that is harmful for the equipment since many of the protection and control devices are designed with the assumption that power always flows in one direction. In this paper, we present results from the ongoing project eDREAM (enabling new Demand REsponse Advanced, Market oriented and Secure technologies, solutions and business models) with some extent on requirements and use cases related a decentralized flexibility system based on ledger technologies.

AB The security issue is one of the greatest challenges in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) attracting a great deal of attention. Malicious onboard units (OBUs) can attack other OBUs with various manners to obtain illegal gains, such as jamming, eavesdropping spoofing and so on. To reduce the potential attackers in the network, we propose an indirect reciprocity security framework with a scalar reputation assigned to each OBU to evaluate their dangerous level to the VANET. A blockchain technique that uses consensus mechanism and encryption algorithms to protect information from being tampered is applied for the transmitter to record the behaviors of other OBUs. We also propose a reinforcement learning based action selection strategy for an OBU in the VANET to choose a reliable relay OBU or determine whether to follow the request of a source OBU or not. A hotbooting technique is applied for the OBUs with prior knowledge to accelerate the learning speed. Simulation results show that the proposed action selection strategy can efficiently increase the packet delivery ratio, the reputation and the utility of the each OBU.

AB The decentralized trading market approach, where both autonomous agents and people can consume and produce services expanding own opportunities to reach goals, looks very promising as a part of the Fourth Industrial revolution. The key component of the approach is a blockchain platform that allows an interaction between agents via liability smart contracts. Reliability of a service provider is usually determined by a reputation model. However, this solution only warns future customers about an extent of trust to the service provider in case it could not execute any previous liabilities correctly. From the other hand a blockchain consensus protocol can additionally include a validation procedure that detects incorrect liability executions in order to suspend payment transactions to questionable service providers. The paper presents the validation methodology of a liability execution for agent-based service providers in a decentralized trading market, using the Model Checking method based on the mathematical model of finite state automata and Temporal Logic properties of interest. To demonstrate this concept, we implemented the methodology in the Duckietown application, moving an autonomous mobile robot to achieve a mission goal with the following behavior validation at the end of a completed scenario.

AB In the power grid, the Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) purchase energy based on a forecast of the user consumption. The forecasts are imperfect, and the corrections of their real-time deviations are managed by a System Operator (SO), which charges the BRPs for the procured imbalances. Flexible consumers, associated with a BRP, can be involved in a demand response (DR) program to reduce the imbalance costs. However, running the DR program requires the BRP to invest resources in the infrastructure and increases its operating costs. To limit the intervention of BRP, we implement the DR via a blockchain smart contract. Moreover, to reduce the delay of publication of the imbalance price, caused by the inefficient accounting process of the current balancing markets, a second blockchain is adopted at the SO layer, procuring a fast and auditable credit settlements. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is evaluated over an Ethereum blockchain platform. The results show that blockchains can enable a high automation of the balancing market, by providing (i) the implementation of aggregators with low operating cost and (ii) the timely and transparent access to the balancing information, thus fostering new business models for the BRPs.

AB We put forward a proposal for a new kind of framework for IOT networks, which can help to quickly setup, build and deploy dedicated IOT networks (we called them "ecosystems") for research or surveillance purposes.
   The proposal includes three components: the software which implements the framework itself, the machine-to-machine learning (M2M) component of the network, and the customization choice of opting either for a centralized compute & storage workstation or a block-chain powered decentralized server.
   The paper emphasizes on the possible implementation of a centralized IOT "ecosystem" and leaves the decentralized version for future discussion. The network is ad-hoc in nature to allow for devices for an easy "connect-&-transmit" process. Given a centralized compute-storage server, a user setups multiple devices like cell phones, camera-microphone enabled smartphones, high quality video recorders, and registers the specific devices to the central server which we call "Control". Once these devices are registered, the Control deploys the built M2M model to learn about the data stream as generated by the registered and now live endpoints of the ecosystem built.
   The M2M model can be more robust alternative for typical anomaly detection models. In addition to this, the data stream can be studied and analysed for specific patterns during specific periods corresponding to exceptional situations like device malfunctions. We introduce a concept of a trust factor for each of the live devices in ecosystem. For a device to have a low degree of trust, the model will be sensitive to anomalies in data stream from that device. For devices with high trust, the model will assume a stance of variable doubt based on its data stream.

AB Power systems world-wide are currently undergoing unprecedented change as the global energy mix transitions from primarily fossil-fuel based synchronous generation towards utility-scale and distributed renewable energy generation. This paper explores the rationale for the pursuit of alternative network architectures to facilitate the transition towards high penetration levels of renewable energies. Furthermore, the emerging research field of transactive energy markets and their potential for energy price reductions is presented. The paper examines the intergrid architecture coupled with a decentralised transactive energy market as a mechanism for permitting higher levels of distributed generation and storage and for energy price reductions, with the Australian energy market used as a case study. The primary contributions of this paper are the development of a decentralised, peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy market (TEM) and the derivation of an autonomous agent algorithm capable of monitoring the internal states of agents to place bids and offers to the market accordingly. This paper (part 1 of 2) investigates the behaviour of the TEM and agent algorithm when applied to an isolated intergrid architecture level. The simulation results contained here-within demonstrate that the decentralised TEM and distributed agent algorithm operate in accordance with the desired fundamental principles of economics (supply vs demand), with the potential for significant retail energy price reductions and higher levels of renewable energies.

AB A companion paper provided a rigorous argument for research into alternative network architectures and decentralised transactive energy market trading mechanisms, using the Australia electricity sector as a case study. This paper builds upon the previous work to hierarchically scale or integrate the transactive energy market (TEM) mechanism and the proposed network architecture (intergrid) to investigate the behaviour of a completed system. Furthermore, this paper builds upon the idealised agent algorithm model presented in the companion paper to include non-ideal conditions such as network losses, component losses, blockchain fees and Distribution Network Service Provider (DNSP) fees. The simulation results contained here-within verify the hypothesis predicted within the companion paper - the hierarchical scaling of the transactive energy market may reduce the market fluctuations (magnitude and frequency) due to increased competition and availability of supply. The results illustrate the potential of the intergrid architecture coupled with a decentralised TEM to permit large penetration levels of distributed generation and storage and for retail energy price reductions.

AB Within this paper, a novel primary level controller for intergrids is presented. The controller may be considered a decentralised master/slave-like control approach. It differs from conventional master/slave controllers in that slave units derive their reference values from a previously proposed secondary controller - a decentralised transactive energy market. The tertiary controller provides power references to the slave units upon execution of a market transaction whilst the voltage master supplies the network losses induced by these energy transactions. The commonly cited pit-fall of the master/slave approach is remedied with an additional controller which aims to hand-over voltage-control responsibility when necessary. The simulation results contained herein demonstrate good performance of the proposed controllers.

TI A Peer-to-Peer Architecture for Distributed Data Monetization in Fog
   Computing Scenarios
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Modern IoT deployments do require considerable investments that might only be justified if the data being gathered could be monetized, which leads to the need for a digital data marketplace. In many cases, the provider of the IoT data needs to process it locally for data curation, aggregation, stream processing, etc. At the same time, the consumer could be interested in nearby data. This scenario resembles a fog computing architecture where companies require being able, keeping data under their control, to securely make it available to other companies in a peer-to-peer fashion, without needing a cloud intermediary (like traditional marketplaces do), thus maximizing the locality of the processing and avoiding the existence of a bottleneck when the intermediary makes the data delivery for accounting purposes. Nevertheless, this imposes a hard requirement: by not having a central marketplace, the peers (seller and customer) need to trust each other, which, in turn, requires enforcing a nonrepudiation schema. In this paper, the authors propose a distributed peer-to-peer architecture for such a data marketplace that takes advantage of the architectural fundamentals of fog computing, in which data processing, filtering, and stream based event generation is done in a fog node along with the data, and where relationships, both commercial agreements and data delivery, are performed directly between producers and consumers without the need of mutual trust thanks to the usage of blockchain principles (e.g., distributed ledger, consensus mechanism). The proposed architecture is validated through a case study involving a set of key issues regarding nonrepudiation commonly identified when moving from a centralized marketplace to a distributed one. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed solution does not bring in any limitation with regard to a centralized marketplace solution, in terms of pricing models (subscriptions, pay-per-use, etc.) or usage conditions (contract duration, updates rate, etc.).

Security of cryptocurrencies ought to be scrutinized in order to acquire esteemed security, attain trust, and accomplish indelible adoption. Although IOTA proffer resilient security controls, IOTA security is not yet well explored. Among all the propounded IOTA vulnerabilities that have been identified, we pragmatically exploit replay attack against IOTA. We further analyze the attack to perceive its impact. Attack methodology and proof of concept for the replay attack is presented. Our proposed exploitation methodology is based upon address reuse, while IOTA in default mode does not reuse addresses. Distrust, and privation of balance can be some of the severe impacts of this vulnerability.

AB We explore a new stage in the evolution of digital trust, trusting strangers with your funds. We address the trust issues when giving money to others and relying on them to forward it. For fraud identification, we leverage our deployed blockchain which gradually builds trust between interacting strangers. Our blockchain fabric, called TrustChain, records interactions between entities in a scalable manner. This work represents a small step towards a generic infrastructure for trust, moving beyond proven single vendor platforms like eBay, Uber and Airbnb.
   Expanding upon established trust relations, we designed, implemented and evaluated an overlay network: Internet-of-Money. Internet-of-Money routes money to different banks through individuals, so-called money routers. This removes the need for central banks, to handle a payment. Our network reduces the duration of traditional inter-bank payments from up to a day and even a few days during weekends, to mere seconds. Internet-of-Money is fully decentralized, scalable and privacy-preserving.
   With real-world experimentations, we prove that Internet-of-Money enables fast money forwarding. We show that the overlay network is capable of discovering a majority of available money routers within a minute. Finally, we demonstrate how profit of cheating routers is limited and that misbehaviour is punished.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCY IN RUSSIA: PROBLEMS OF LEGAL REGULATION
SO AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
AB The paper is devoted to the main problems of legal regulation of the crypto currency in Russia. The paper gives examples of court proceedings where an example of a dispute was a crypto wallet. The author draws attention to the need for an analysis of foreign experience in the legal regulation of this problem As a result of a comparative legal study of foreign legislation in several countries, the author comes to the conclusion that there are two ways of legal regulation (normative, informational). The normative way of legal regulation is that a state adopts special legal acts aimed at regulating the legal relationship on the turnover of the crypto currency. The information approach to legal regulation is that a state does not prohibit the use of crypto currency, but informs consumers of financial services about possible economic and legal risks in the process of its application. The author also conducts an examination of all bills on the legal regulation of the crypto currency in Russia. The analysis of bills "On digital financial assets", "On alternative ways of attracting investment (crowdfimding)" and "On introducing amendments to parts one, two and four of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation" was conducted. All these bills have their own advantages and disadvantages. In this regard, the author of the paper developed recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of legal regulation of crypto-currency turnover in Russia.

AB Power and energy systems are undergoing unprecedented change driven by many factors like global warming, digitalization, new sorts of renewable energy sources (RESs). Many countries incentivize the installation of RESs with subsidies and programs like a high rate of feed-in tariffs. However, these promotions are not sustainable. Some countries started to decrease the feed-in tariffs due to the cost of RESs are in decline. Since they want to reduce the volatility risk of small-scale RESs, they also don't give capacity for unlicensed plants. Renewable energy cooperatives (RECs) emerge as an alternative to encourage the installation of unlicensed RESs. They can be defined as prosumers in the system. Also, a peer to peer energy trading between cooperatives within the local community might increase the profit of cooperative in the same region. Because of this, the peer to peer business model approach is proposed in this study. The smart contract by using blockchain technology is used in this proposed approach due to making transactions faster, and to provide a dynamic market and blockchain is used to make transactions data secure.

AB As more and more data is collected for various reasons, the sharing of such data becomes paramount to increasing its value. Many applications ranging from smart cities to personalized health care require individuals and organizations to share data at an unprecedented scale. Data sharing is crucial in today's world, but due to privacy reasons, security concerns and regulation issues, the conditions under which the sharing occurs needs to be carefully specified. Currently, this process is done by lawyers and requires the costly signing of legal agreements. In many cases, these data sharing agreements are hard to track, manage or enforce. In this work, we propose a novel alternative for tracking, managing and especially adjudicating such data sharing agreements using smart contracts and blockchain technology. We design a framework that generates smart contracts from parameters based on legal data sharing agreements. The terms in these agreements are automatically adjudicating by the system. Monetary punishment can be employed using secure voting by external auditors to hold the violators accountable. Our experimental evaluation shows that our proposed framework is efficient and low-cost.

AB There are different approaches to developing a syllabus for a "blockchain curriculum" in a business school. The following chapter identifies many questions which can guide lecturers through their own process of creating a blockchain syllabus. The list of topics and figures presented indicate how much time could be spent on these topics. This list does not present a definite syllabus, because the essence of blockchain is that it is a holistic approach which goes beyond naming topics. It raises certain questions and is intended to start a broader discussion which will eventually lead to a systematic approach to this multidimensional challenge. Structuring this journey leads to the following four main questions, which are considered relevant in this discussion:
   What are the key research topics in blockchain?
   What is the impact of blockchain and by what criteria do we define impact?
   Which building blocks of blockchain are relevant to understanding the blockchain mechanism?
   Which applications (beside Bitcoin) should be discussed and are expected to become important in the near and distant future?
   This journey closes with some methodological remarks based on my experience of teaching blockchain classes. Finally, it is obvious that any curriculum will be condemned to continuous adaption because blockchain technology is changing in an ongoing way.

AB Recently we could see several institutions coming together to create consortium based blockchain networks such as Hyperledger. Although for applications of blockchain such as Bitcoin, Litcoin, etc. the majority-attack might not be a great threat but for consortium based blockchain networks where we could see several institutions such as public, private, government, etc. are collaborating, the majority-attack might just prove to be a prevalent threat if collusion among these institutions takes place. This paper proposes a methodology where we can use intelligent software agents to monitor the activity of stakeholders in the blockchain networks to detect anomaly such as collusion, using supervised machine learning algorithm and algorithmic game theory and stop the majority-attack from taking place.

AB A major consequence of the Internet era is the emergence of complex "platforms" that combine technology and process in new ways that often disrupt existing industry structures and blur industry boundaries. These platforms allow easy participation that often strengthens and extends network effects, while at the same time the vast amounts of data captured through such participation can increase the value of the platform to its participants, creating a virtuous cycle. While initially slow to penetrate the financial services sector, such platforms are now beginning to emerge. We provide a taxonomy of platforms in finance and identify the feasible strategies that are available to incumbents in the industry, innovators, and the major Internet giants.

AB The recent advances in distributed energy systems require new models for exchanging energy among prosumers in microgrids. The blockchain technology promises to solve the digital issues related to distributed systems without a trusted authority and to allow quick and secure energy transactions, which are verified and cryptographically protected. Transactions are approved and subsequently recorded on all the machines participating in the blockchain. This work demonstrates how users, which are nodes of the energy and digital networks, exchange energy supported by a customized blockchain based on Tendermint. We focus on the procedures for generating blocks and defining data structures for storing energy transactions.

TI A Blockchain-based Approach for Access Control in eHealth Scenarios
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SECURITY
AB Access control is a crucial part of a system's security, restricting what actions users can perform on resources. Therefore, access control is a core component when dealing with eHealth data and resources, discriminating which is available for a certain party. We consider that current systems that attempt to assure the share of policies between facilities are prone to system's and network's faults and do not assure the integrity of policies life-cycle. By approaching this problem with a blockchain where the operations are stored as transactions, we can ensure that the different facilities have knowledge about all the parts that can act over the eHealth resources while maintaining integrity, auditability, and authenticity.

AB Ethereum provides an open, global computing platform, that allows the exchange of value, automated and enforced workflows, and the development of general purpose applications and libraries. Smart contracts present a foundation for the computational capabilities of the Ethereum network. Motivated by the known security breaches and recurring financial losses due to smart contracts vulnerabilities, we review the field of security of smart contract programming and provide a comprehensive taxonomy of all known security issues. We achieve that by a thorough review of known vulnerabilities. In this work we also review the security code analysis tools used to identify known vulnerabilities. We conduct the investigation of security code analysis tools on Ethereum by assessing their effectiveness and accuracy on known issues on a representative sample of vulnerable contracts. We have used 21 clean, and 24 vulnerable contracts and four security tools: Oyente, Securify, Remix, and SmartCheck, to assess the quality of contemporary security analysis tools specific to Ethereum. The results indicate that there are overall inconsistencies between the tools in respect to different security properties. SmartCheck outperformed the other tools in terms of effectiveness, whereas Oyente performed the best in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, based on the limitations we identified, we propose improvements within the user interfaces, interpretation of results, and, most importantly, an enhanced list for vulnerability checks.

TI Applying Modern, Disruptive Technologies to Improve the Effectiveness of
   Tax Treaty Dispute Resolution: Part 1
SO INTERTAX
AB This comprehensive two-part article addresses how modern, disruptive technologies can be used to improve the effectiveness of tax treaty dispute resolution.
   It is clear that international tax dispute resolution needs improvement. The OECD, the European Union and the United Nations have all recently taken measures to this effect by promoting the prevention and timely resolution of treaty-related disputes. However, none of these recommendations considers technology.
   In this context, this article examines whether the emergence of new and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, shared-data platforms, cloud-based solutions and blockchain could complement the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) and supplementary arbitration and render them more effective by speeding up the resolution, reducing costs and establishing trust between tax administrations and taxpayers.
   To answer this question, in Part 1 of this article, the authors briefly analyse the main drawbacks of the existing tax treaty dispute resolution process from the perspective of various stakeholders. Next, the article focuses on the fundamental features of a few significant types of technology and analyses how they could improve this process.
   In Part 2 of this article, the authors will use the analysis from Part 1 to make some specific suggestions as to how the technologies discussed can be used to improve the MAP and supplementary solutions, with an aim to encourage the above-mentioned policy organizations to consider the potential of disruptive technologies in their work.

AB The increasing demand for mobile network capacity driven by Internet of Things (IoT) applications results in the need for understanding better the potential and limitations of 5G networks. Vertical application areas like smart mobility, energy networks, industrial IoT applications, and AR/VR enhanced services all pose different requirements on the use of 5G networks. Some applications need low latency, whereas others need high bandwidth or security support. The goal of this paper is to identify the requirements and to understand the limitations for 5G driven applications. We review application areas and list the typical challenges and requirements posed on 5G networks. A main challenge will be to develop a network architecture being able to dynamically adapt to fluctuating traffic patterns and accommodating various technologies such as edge computing, blockchain based distributed ledger, software defined networking, and virtualization. To inspire future research, we reveal open problems and highlight the need for piloting with 5G applications, with tangible steps, to understand the configuration of 5G networks and the use of applications across multiple vertical industries.

AB Distributed Ledgers, such as blockchains implement business collaboration processes in the form of smart contracts (SCs). Blockchain technology and smart contracts have received significant attention as they exhibit autonomy, decentralization, trust, and transparency over peer-to-peer networks while moving the assets digitally among peers without a third-party such as lawyers in conventional contracts (CCs). Smart contracts are computerized scripts or protocols that execute contractual clauses when certain pre-defined conditions meet and thereby digitally enforce the negotiation and performance of a contract. Smart contracts, although, being self-executable and self-enforceable, are irreversible once written and lack contractual flexibility in the face of a contingency. A high degree of automation is sought to manifest blockchain enabled smart contracts into the so-called self-aware contracts (SAC) that can be aware of its internal contextual environment and the external environment or real world events. This Ph.D. work aims to develop the belief-desire intention (BDI) model based multi-agent system (MAS) on the top of the smart contracts to yield the so-called self-aware human readable contracts for legal viability. This research follows the guidelines of the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology.

AB Image authentication importance increases as image acquisition becomes easier with the help of new technologies. Today, almost any phone has a camera with decent performances and sharing images is encouraged by social media. Image tampering is also decreasing in difficulty because of the advances in image editing software. Today's signature-based image authentication techniques rely on storing the image signature until the authentication is needed. This is a disadvantage because the storage support is usually unique, controlled by one entity and could fail. Also, this centralized approach is not fundamentally trustworthy. To solve these problems, the paper proposes a signature-based image authentication method resistant to JPEG compression which makes use of new blockchain technology to store the image signature. With this method, the signature is stored in a decentralized network, significantly increasing the security.

AB Public key infrastructures (PKIs), or more generally secure naming systems, lie at the foundation of the security of any communication system. Without a trustworthy binding between user-facing names, such as domain names, and cryptographic identities, such as public keys, all security guarantees against. active attackers come crashing down like a house of cards.
   Blockchains such as Bitcoin, by offering a decentralized yet secure public ledger, show promise as the root of trust for naming systems with no central trusted parties, greatly increasing their security compared to traditional centralized PKIs. Yet blockchain PKIs such as Namecoin and Blockstack tend to significantly sacrifice scalability and flexibility in pursuit of decentralization, hindering large-scale deployability on the Internet.
   We propose Bitforest, a secure naming system with an architecture combining a centralized yet only partially trusted name server with efficiently queryable verification data embedded in a novel data structure inside a cryptocurrency blockchain. Bitforest achieves decentralized trust and security as strong as existing blockchain-based naming systems while retaining most of the flexibility and performance of centralized PKIs, allowing fully validating thin clients to look up and verify name bindings with comparable efficiency to traditional systems. We use both numerical simulation and real-world experiments to evaluate the performance of Bitforest compared with other naming systems, both centralized and blockchain-based, showing that its performance goals are indeed achieved.

AB Secure naming systems, or more narrowly public key infrastructures (PKIs), form the basis of secure communications over insecure networks. All security guarantees against active attackers come from a trustworthy binding between user-facing names, such as domain names, to cryptographic identities, such as public keys.
   By offering a secure, distributed ledger with highly decentralized trust, blockchains such as Bitcoin show promise as the root of trust for naming systems with no central trusted parties. PKIs based upon blockchains, such as Namecoin and Blockstack, have greatly improved security and resilience compared to traditional centralized PKIs. Yet blockchain PKIs tend to significantly sacrifice scalability and flexibility in pursuit of decentralization, hindering large-scale deployability on the Internet.
   We propose Conifer, a novel PKI with an architecture based upon CONIKS, a centralized transparency-based PKI, and Catena, a blockchain-agnostic way of embedding a permissioned log, but with a different lookup strategy. In doing so, Conifer achieves decentralized trust with security at least as strong as existing blockchain-based naming systems, yet without sacrificing the flexibility and performance typically found in centralized PKIs. We also present our reference implementation of Conifer, demonstrating how it can easily be integrated into applications. Finally, we use experiments to evaluate the performance of Conifer compared with other naming systems, both centralized and blockchain-based, demonstrating that it incurs only a modest overhead compared to traditional centralized-trust systems while being far more scalable and performant than purely blockchain-based solutions.

AB Cryptocurrencies especially bitcoin has received a lot of attention in the past year. The popularity has increased the volume of transactions in an unprecedented way. The time to complete a simple pairwise transaction from one virtual wallet to other takes time in proof-of-work where transactions are added into the Blockchain. At the same time, validating a pairwise transaction is very significant in this new technology as a payment option. Through this study, we propose a heuristic approach for validating pairwise transactions on cryptocurrencies. Our heuristic simulate all entities sending and receiving transactions among themselves. We use SHA256 algorithm to enhance our solution for pairwise transactions, creating a local Blockchain of transactions that has been used in the development of various Blockchain systems. For our experiments, we ran simulations in-file and in-memory with 2 million transactions in 290.39 and 5.34 seconds respectively. Our peak transactions per second was 6.887 using a file persistence version and 374.255 with in-memory version. Based on our experiments we conclude that is possible to improve the number of transactions processed per second increasing the size of the block as well as avoiding access to the file during the simulation. We also present some of our results implementing our algorithm in a parallel environment and hence show better performance.

AB Computing power has increased exponentially in the last decades, and more and more consumer devices are now permanently connected to the Internet, to form the so called "Internet of Things" (IoT). Following this trend, security threats and vulnerabilities have increased drastically over a short period of time, as more and more devices are inter-connected and not properly secured. Lately, the growing popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are generating a lot of hype and concern, among security specialists, as unwanted mining applications on an end-user device can potentially pose both security risks and increased operating costs. There are multiple ways of detecting unwanted applications at the user-level, by means of URL blocking and application fingerprinting, and this paper will cover a detection method proposed by our group.

AB Software upgrade is necessary, which can not only get the new software features, but also fix software vulnerabilities to improve security. With the rapid development of Internet of things (IoT), all kinds of smart devices increase sharply, so traditional C/S (client/server)-based software upgrade model is difficult to satisfy the application scenario. In order to guarantee massive terminal software upgrade in secure and efficient way, this paper proposes a novel software upgrade scheme for IoT terminals based on the block chain technology. In the scheme, there exists a variety of terminal devices in the IoT scenario, and each terminal device has a variety of softwares, and each software upgrade record is stored in the block chain by consensus mechanism. Terminal device can query software update record from block chain and download the latest software version from adjacent terminal device in IoT, which can complete software upgrade spontaneously, with the advantage of decentralization. At the same time, the scheme can ensure the timeliness and traceability of software upgrade. This scheme takes advantage of the untamperability of block chain data to guarantee its security and reliability, which provides a new solution for terminal device software upgrade in IoT scenerio.

AB Usually, medical information including physical examination results and treatment of patients is stored in the hospital's centralized database. Although sophisticated access control strategy is adopted, it is still high-risk to expose patients' privacy in complex network environment. Moreover, a practical service platform is missed to share this kind of information under patients' authentication. To solve these problem, we elaborate an efficient and secure medical information service platform based on distributed cloud and blockchain technology, simultaneously guarantee security and confidentiality by hierarchical identity-based broadcast encryption system. Within our proposed framework, medical data are stored on distributed cloud after encryption. An incentive mechanism is designed to encourage customers and miners to maintain the platform. It shows that our platform is safe and effective in practice.

AB We present BEAT, a set of practical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols for completely asynchronous environments. BEAT is flexible, versatile, and extensible, consisting of five asynchronous BFT protocols that are designed to meet different goals (e.g., different performance metrics, different application scenarios). Due to modularity in its design, features of these protocols can be mixed to achieve even more meaningful trade-offs between functionality and performance for various applications. Through a 92-instance, five-continent deployment of BEAT on Amazon EC2, we show that BEAT is efficient: roughly, all our BEAT instances significantly outperform, in terms of both latency and throughput, HoneyBadgerBFT, the most efficient asynchronous BFT known.

AB By using a decentralized peer-to-peer network together with public and distributed ledger to decentralize the central authority, Blockchain has shown its great potential with the success of Bit coin. However, the blockchain technology can go beyond financial transactions. In this paper, we propose an approach that utilizes the blockchain technology to issue immutable digital certificates and improve the current limitations of the existing certificate verifying systems such as faster, more trusted, and independent of the central authority. Our prototype has been successfully deployed for several short-term courses at the Center of Computer Engineering, HCMC University of Technology, Vietnam. This result indicates that our proposed system is an appropriate solution adopting ICT for e-government, especially in certificate and diploma management.

AB The ubiquitous deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices enhances connectivity and communication, and benefits almost every aspect of our lives from manufacturing to retail to smart homes. However, low levels of security protection in these devices due to their limited resources open opportunities for malicious users. An IoT forensics system collecting, processing, analyzing and reporting evidence of attack is required to mitigate the IoT security issues. Although such system has been studied over the past decade and solutions such as cloud-based IoT forensic were proposed, limitation still exist. In this paper, leveraging on the blockchain technology, we propose a permissioned blockchain-based IoT forensics framework to enhance the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation properties for the collected evidence. We formally define the system architecture, provide framework details, and propose a cryptographic-based approach to mitigate identity privacy concern.

AB In the past years, the security of Bitcoin-like protocols has been intensively studied. However, previous investigations are mainly focused on the single-mode version of Bitcoin protocol, where the protocol is running among full nodes (miners). In this paper, we initiate the study of multi-mode cryptocurrency protocols. We generalize the recent framework by Garay et al. (Eurocrypt 2015) with new security definitions that capture the security of realistic cryptocurrency systems (e.g. Bitcoin with full and lightweight nodes). We provide the first rigorous security model for addressing the "blockchain bloat" issue. As an immediate application of our new framework, we analyze the security of existing blockchain pruning proposals for Bitcoin aiming to improve the storage efficiency of network nodes by pruning unnecessary information from the ledger.

AB Smart contracts play an advent role in automated business participation by rendering collaboration processes more time efficient, cost-effective and establishing more transparency. Smart contracts facilitate trust-less systems, without the need for intervention from third-party intermediaries. Existing smart contract languages mainly focus on technical utility and do not take into consideration social and legally relevant issues, e.g., lack of semantics, ontological completeness, and so on. In this research, we address the gap by developing with rigorous means a smart contract's language that aims to be legally relevant, and that comprises socio-technical utility for cross organizational business collaboration. The proposed language seeks to retain the strengths of the already existing languages of different generations while eluding their limitations. We aim to identify and implement abstract grammar patterns for a smart-contract language that has the expected application utility and verifiability. We evaluate the developed language based on automating industry-collaboration cases with our novel smart contract language to test the suitability, utility and expressiveness.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCY IN THE SYSTEM OF MONEY LAUNDERING
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB The target of the article is to study the place of the cryptocurrency in the process of money laundering. The subject of the article is to investigate the ways and means of usage cryptocurrency for money laundering, the possibilities, and limits. Problem's setting. The authors of the paper have emphasized that despite the broad usage of cryptocurrency all over the world for different kinds of purchasing and transactions, there is no unified position regarding the definition of cryptocurrency, as well as its legal status. Moreover, the aforementioned circumstances trigger the difficulties during the criminal investigation of money laundering by using cryptocurrency. Thus, law informant agencies are facing challenges with the identification of criminals' personality and the fact of crime commitment. In addition, in the article, the authors articulate the main concept of cryptocurrency: anonymity and decentralization, which engender the main aggro while crime investigation. Methodology. The research is based on an analysis of historical stages of cryptocurrency creation: from Friedrich August von Hayek's idea of "currency independent from banking and governmental" to the establishment of decentralized currency. Moreover, there were analysed the cases of money laundering where criminals who used cryptocurrency have been identified and press charged. In addition, the comparative methods were used to collate different positions regarding cryptocurrency all over the world and inside Ukraine. The position of the main authorities and organizations regarding the legal status of cryptocurrency was investigated as well. The results of the study revealed that a cryptocurrency is a convenient tool for money laundering because it gives relative anonymity for the owner of the currency, as far as it does not require any personal information about the user and his location. Aforementioned feature minimizes the opportunity for law enforcement agencies to track back the criminal activity and to identify the criminal personality. Furthermore, cryptocurrency transactions are out of the government control because for conducting any transactions by using cryptocurrency, there is no need for their verification by third parties like a bank, governmental authority or nongovernmental organizations. In addition, the user can have more than one account and conduct transactions from different places at the same time.

AB Scalability and privacy are two challenges for today's blockchain systems. Processing transactions at every node in the system limits the system's ability to scale. Furthermore, the requirement to publish all corporate or individual information for processing at every node, essentially making the data public, is - despite of all other advantages - often considered a major obstacle to blockchain adoption. In this paper, we make two main contributions to address these two problems: (i) To increase efficiency, we propose a processing model which employs non-interactive proofs to off-chain computations, thereby reducing on-chain computational efforts to the verification of correctness of execution rather than the execution itself. Due to the verifiable computation scheme's zero-knowledge property, private information used in the off-chain computation does not have to become public to verify correctness. (ii) We introduce ZoKrates, a toolbox to specify, integrate and deploy such off-chain computations. It consists of a domain-specific language, a compiler, and generators for proofs and verification Smart Contracts. ZoKrates hides significant complexity inherent to zero-knowledge proofs, provides a more familiar and higher level of programming abstractions to developers and enables circuit integration, hence fostering adoption.

AB At least since the first Bitcoin futures were launched in December 2017, quantitative risk management on Bitcoin is no longer indispensable. This paper provides methodology and fundamental findings on approximations of intraday bitcoin returns through both symmetric and non-symmetric probability distributions. Different time frequencies of Bitcoin returns were analysed, and their non-Normal behaviour is shown. Their exchange rates versus the US Dollar, between April 14, 2017 until August 7, 2017, were considered by fitting parametric distributions to them. The non-normality changes with the size of the timesteps, where standard heavy-tailed distributions give good fits of the data. These results are a first attempt to characterize intraday risk of the Bitcoin.

AB Nowadays, we can enjoy many internet applications including online lotteries and games. The results of lotteries, card games, dice throwing and so on, depend upon the values of random numbers generated under some rules. However, we cannot verify the correctness for the given random numbers, that means, we have no means to convince ourselves that the given random numbers have indeed been correctly generated, using a pre-determined algorithm, and without being intentionally perverted by anyone. We say that such random number generation can provide 'transparency'. It is quite important that random numbers given online can convince us that those are correctly generated. In other words, the transparency of online random number generation is quite important. Sako et. al. [5] have given a random number generation scheme applicable to the game 'Backgammon', in which transparency of blockchain enables us to verify the correctness for used random numbers after the game ended. In that scheme, however, the server has to be a trusted party, and it means dishonest generation of random numbers is possible by making one player and the server corrupted. In this paper, we present a transparent random number generation scheme. To be sure that a few trusted parties appears in the description of the scheme, but by implementing such trusted ones with public blockchain actually operated, our scheme can generate transparent random numbers without requiring any trusted parties.

AB Internet of Things and data sciences are fueling the development of innovative solutions for various applications in Smart and Connected Communities (SCC). These applications provide participants with the capability to exchange not only data but also resources, which raises the concerns of integrity, trust, and above all the need for fair and optimal solutions to the problem of resource allocation. This exchange of information and resources leads to a problem where the stakeholders of the system may have limited trust in each other. Thus, collaboratively reaching consensus on when, how, and who should access certain resources becomes problematic. This paper presents SolidWorx, a blockchain-based platform that provides key mechanisms required for arbitrating resource consumption across different SCC applications in a domain-agnostic manner. For example, it introduces and implements a hybrid-solver pattern, where complex optimization computation is handled off-blockchain while solution validation is performed by a smart contract. To ensure correctness, the smart contract of SolidWorx is generated and verified using a model-based approach.

AB Recent theoretical attacks conjectured the vulnerabilities of mainstream blockchains through simulations or assumption violations. Unfortunately, previous results typically omit both the nature of the network under which the blockchain code runs and whether blockchains are private, consortium or public.
   In this paper, we study the public Ethereum blockchain as well as a consortium and private blockchains and quantify the feasibility of man-in-the-middle and double spending attacks against them. To this end, we list important properties of the Ethereum public blockchain topology, we deploy VMs with constrained CPU quantum to mimic the top-10 mining pools of Ethereum and we attack them, by first partitionning the network through BGP hijacking or ARP spoofing before issuing a Balance Attack to steal coins. Our results demonstrate that attacking Ethereum is remarkably devastating in a consortium or private context as the adversary can multiply her digital assets by 200, 000x in 10 hours through BGP hijacking whereas it would be almost impossible in a public context.

AB The need to process the verity, volume and velocity of data generated by today's Internet of Things (IoT) devices has pushed both academia and the industry to investigate new architectural alternatives to support the new challenges. As a result, Edge Computing (EC) has emerged to address these issues, by placing part of the cloud resources (e.g., computation, storage, logic) closer to the edge of the network, which allows faster and context dependent data analysis and storage. However, as EC infrastructures grow, different providers who do not necessarily trust each other need to collaborate in order serve different IoT devices. In this context, EC infrastructures, IoT devices and the data transiting the network all need to be subject to identity and provenance checks, in order to increase trust and accountability. Each device/data in the network needs to be identified and the provenance of its actions needs to be tracked. In this paper, we propose a blockchain container based architecture that implements the W3C-PROV Data Model, to track identities and provenance of all orchestration decisions of a business network. This architecture provides new forms of interaction between the different stakeholders, which supports trustworthy transactions and leads to a new decentralized interaction model for IoT based applications.

AB We propose in this article to study the behavior of investors in the bitcoin market in order to test whether investors' overconfidence is a driver of excess volatility, often associated with the aforementioned market. This paper presents an attempt to deepen the previously published studies by adopting a new ARMA(p,q)-FIEGARCH(1,d,k,1) parametrization capable of capturing the overconfidence element as well as simultaneously accounting for possible long memory effect. The data used in this study consists of daily closing prices along with daily exchange volume of Bitcoin, spanning the period ranging from 01/01/2012 up to 31/05/2018.
   The results and conclusions drafted in this research paper could help to understand the formation of volatility in the Bitcoin market. Therefore, this kind of studies will enable investors to better predict bubbles and irrational exuberances. The main contribution of the present article is drawn from the broadening of previous studies by adopting a newly constructed model, which combines capturing asymmetric response, long memory along with the overconfidence element.

AB Blockchain technology and the application of smart contracts allow for automation of verifiable digital processes between any number of parties. The Internet of Things (loT) has seen great potential in the past decade to revolutionise our day-to-day lives with the aim of automating physical processes by incorporating Internet-connected devices into commodities. By integrating the IoT with blockchain systems and smart contracts it is passible to provide verifiable automation of physical processes involving different parties. The challenge lies in that due to resource constraints, many of the computational devices used within the IoT are not capable of directly interacting with blockchain implementations. In this paper, we describe and give a reference design and implementation of a split-virtual machine, AlkylVM, which allows for resource constrained loT devices to interact with blockchain systems.

AB Distributed Ledger Technologies have promising applications in the Internet of Things. However, scalability and support for micropayments remain problems for blockchain-based applications, therefore other alternatives such as IOTA should be considered. This work reports on an experimental evaluation of IOTA on several different IoT platforms. We show that even though the communication overhead to join the IOTA network can be significantly reduced by adapting a proxy-based architecture, the computational overhead remains high. We conclude that IOTA is not currently suitable for battery-powered IoT devices.

AB Privacy in block-chains is considered second to functionality, but a vital requirement for many new applications, e.g., in the industrial environment. We propose a novel transaction type, which enables privacy preserving trading of independent assets on a common block-chain. This is achieved by extending the ring confidential transaction with an additional commitment to a colour and a publicly verifiable proof of conservation. With our coloured confidential ring signatures, new token types can be introduced and transferred by any participant using the same sized anonymity set as single-token privacy aware block-chains. Thereby, our system facilitates tracking assets on an immutable ledger without compromising the confidentiality of transactions.

AB Within the "Industrie 4.0" approach, 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between "original part", "copy" or "counterfeit" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classicly branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented. These are currently being developed by an 8-partner project named SAMPL (Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform).

AB Blockchains and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) are a much-proposed solution for an Internet of Things (IoT) payment platform. Because of their decentralized networks, they are one of the few technologies which allow for true Machine-to-Machine financial transactions, considered essential for the IoT economy. In this paper, we examine the issues surrounding IoT payment systems, including their requirements and proposed specifications. We will also discuss limitations of blockchains to meet these specific requirements, and whether other DLTs or possible optimization solutions for blockchains can overcome these limitations. We present example IoT payment implementations using DLTs to illustrate the opportunities surrounding this technology. This paper aims to capture the breadth and depth of this topic to understand why IoT payment systems are essential to the IoT economy and how blockchains might provide the answer for implementing them in an effective manner.

AB Currently, immutable blockchain-based ledgers become important tools for cryptocurrency transactions, auditing, smart contracts, copyright registration and many other applications. In this regard, there is a need to analyze the typical, repetitive actions written to the ledger, for example, to identify suspicious cryptocurrency transactions, a chain of events that led to information security incident, or to predict recurrence of some situation in the future. We propose to use for these purposes the algorithms for T-patterns discovering and to cluster the identified behavioral patterns subsequently. In case of having labeled patterns, clustering might be replaced by classification.

AB Illegal content on a blockchain cannot be removed and the originator might not be identifiable. At the same time, node operators that have no control over the content stored on their nodes might be held legally responsible. As a decentralized system, Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) needs decentralized governance and smart contract dispute resolution. Existing DLT governance and dispute resolution is only aimed at balancing the interests of DLT and smart contract participants. It fails to address the interests of third parties and society. The failure to do so could trigger government and court intervention within DLT systems, Although the decentralized nature of a DLT system will offer some pretection against this intervention, participants might be identifiable and subject to legal presecunon, We present a design also addressing the interests of society and third parties that wiD have to be accompanied by an international legal framework.

AB Mass penetration and market dominance of Electric Vehicles (EVs) are expected in the upcoming years. Due to their frequent charging needs, not only public and private charging stations are being built, but also V2V charging options are considered. This forms a charging network with various suppliers and EV customers which can communicate to schedule charging operations. While an app can be designed to develop matching algorithms for charging schedules, the system also needs a convenient payment method that will enable privacy-preserving transactions among the suppliers and EVs. In this paper, we adopt a Bitcoin-based payment system for the EV charging network payments. However, Bitcoin has a transaction fee which would be comparable to the price of the charging service most of the time and thus may not be attractive to users. High transaction fees can be eliminated by building a payment network in parallel to main ledger, with permission and signatures. In this paper, we design and implement such a network among charging stations and mobile EVs with flow, connectivity and fairness constraints, and demonstrate results for the feasibility of the scheme under different circumstances. More specifically, we propose a payment network optimization model for determining payment channels among charging stations. We present numerical results on the characteristics of the network model by using realistic use cases.

SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose - This paper aims to help build awareness with the regulatory, enforcement and customs authorities as well as reporting entities about money laundering risks and vulnerabilities of the Mavrodi Mondial Movement (MMM) scheme, and how to mitigate them.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research took the form of a desk study, which analyzed various documents and reports such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) typologies reports in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2014 on new payment methods (NPMs) which focused on the potential for NPM to be misused by criminals; the identification of risk factors which can significantly differ from one new payment product or service to another, depending on functionality; and risk mitigants which can be tailored to a particular new payment product or service to address its specific risk profile.
   Findings - This paper presents the following findings and recommendations: high-risk customers such as politically exposed persons (PEPs) could exploit the non-face-to-face feature of MMM by using the identity of low-risk customers (e.g. pensioners) to open MMM accounts. The Bitcoin funding option may present a higher money laundering risk than Bank wire, MasterCard, Visa Debit and Interac. The electronic nature of Bitcoins provides in principle a good foundation for effective record keeping and the monitoring of transactions. The money laundering risks associated with Goldmoney are very minimal when compared to Bitcoin. MMM Nigeria is therefore recommended to adopt Goldmoney as its preferred method of online payment for MMM transactions.
   Originality/value - While most publications on MMM are focused on fraud, this paper focuses on the money laundering risks and vulnerabilities associated with the MMM scheme.

AB Health-related data analysis plays an important role in self-knowledge, disease prevention, diagnosis, and quality of life assessment. With the advent of data-driven solutions, a myriad of apps and Internet of Things (IoT) devices (wearables, home-medical sensors, etc) facilitates data collection and provide cloud storage with a central administration. More recently, blockchain and other distributed ledgers became available as alternative storage options based on decentralised organisation systems. We bring attention to the human data bleeding problem and argue that neither centralised nor decentralised system organisations are a magic bullet for data-driven innovation if individual, community and societal values are ignored. The motivation for this position paper is to elaborate on strategies to protect privacy as well as to encourage data sharing and support open data without requiring a complex access protocol for researchers. Our main contribution is to outline the design of a self-regulated Open Health Archive (OHA) system with focus on quality of life (QoL) data.

It can be done through digitizing 'Parivar Register' to generate results using artificial intelligence with the help of designed algorithms for the same and this public record can be stored through block chain technology for the management of government trusted information. This will help them to curtail time loss component in service delivery mechanism, avail needed certificates, gather information about their queries and eligibility for different government and non-government benefits, at one single point, and will give a perception of a smart e-village.

AB Nowadays, the development of the Internet of Things is growing rapidly. This condition raises security problems because of the many violations of security policies. In addition, the development of blockchain is also growing rapidly since it was first popularized in Bitcoin. Security issues on this IoT can be solved using blockchain. One way that can be done is to make secure communication between IoT devices. In this study, an IoT system will be created without and using blockchain which will then be compared between the two. The communication protocol used in IoT systems without blockchain is MQTT. Meanwhile, the blockchain platform used is Ethereum along with a smart contract. Both of these IoT systems will be analyzed for their security level by simulating attacks and observing their security aspects. The test results show that the IoT system based on blockchain technology has a higher level of security than the IoT system without blockchain technology.

AB As the rising popularity of Bitcoin, people tend to use Bitcoin wallets to managing the keys for spending or receiving funds. Instead of generating pairs of keys randomly which are hard to be stored, hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets derive all the keys from a single seed, thus storing that seed is sufficient to recover keys. In an HD wallet, it allows users to generate child public keys from parent public keys without knowledge of any private key. A suitable case for this feature is that an auditor is permitted to derive all the public keys for auditing. However, this impressive feature makes HD wallets suffered from so-called privilege escalation attacks that the leakage of any one of child private key along with its parent public key will cause the exposure of the other child private keys. To confront with this severe problem, we propose a novel HD wallet scheme that gives out a signature with trapdoor hash functions instead of directly giving anyone private keys for signing. Since it conceals private keys from any child nodes, it can prevent from privilege escalation attacks. Nevertheless, the proposed scheme also provides unlinkability between two public keys in order to achieve anonymity of user identity and high scalability to the derivations of keys. Thus, the proposed scheme achieves user anonymity, public key derivation and high scalability.

SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS
AB At present, the domestic securities registration is basically controlled by third parties, and it is not necessary to be identified after the transaction. Therefore, if a third party's operating platform is maliciously attacked, it may change some of the information on the equity securities asset. Block chain application technology can transfer securities assets in the network system to check whether the security of securities assets through the P2P system. As the entire stock transaction process is stored in the block chain, the risk can be greatly reduced; the application of block chain technology can effectively prevent the securities assets from being tampered with in the course of the transaction. Aiming at the problem that the block chain technology is used to prevent the data from being tampered with in the course of the transaction, the storage system of securities trading based on block chain was proposed. Transactions of securities assets based on block chains were realized through the design of the system. The system was designed by using Java technology. Block chains were used as a basis for design ideas, and securities transactions were written into block chains and transferred to database.

AB With the development of computer and network technology, on-board computers have more stronger capability of computing and network communication. Multiple vehicles can form an Autonomous Vehicular Cloud (AVC) for the certain need to provide cloud computing services for customers. However, the infrastructure of AVC is open completely, how to guarantee the non-repudiation of task execution information is a very important issue during the process of task execution. Blockchain technology is a proven technology with information security and non-repudiation in distributed environments. Smart contract of Ethereum used to design a kind of task scheduling strategy which is suitable for the AVC environment in this paper. The strategy can guarantee the non-repudiation of task execution information. This paper builds the private chain of Ethereum on simulation vehicles node and creates and deploys the smart contract. Experiments show that the task scheduling strategy is very effective.

AB The era of information has arrived. As an important part of new generation of information technology, Internet of Things (IoT), which is developing rapidly, requires higher and higher time accuracy. However, the malicious nodes located in network can influence the time synchronization. The security issue of time transfer and consistency is critical and challenging. In this paper, we propose a secure scheme based on blockchain to solve the problem of time announcement in IoT. In this distributed network, a closed blockchian to record and broadcast time is utilized, which minimize attacks from external environments. Moreover, this scheme has the advantage of adapting the changes of network topology. By employing POS consensus mechanism, time synchronization can be implemented efficiently. At last, the analysis results show that this secure scheme can be achieved with high efficiency and less communication cost.

AB Security of the Internet of Things represents a field that strongly attracts academia and industry since it represents one of the main obstacles in its adoption. In this area, authentication and authorization methods holds a golden place in priority rank. Indeed, current approaches suffers from numerous limits. Moreover, generally, deployment systems use separately two methods one dedicated to the authentication and the other to the authorization, while the number of methods that combine both requirements is limited. In this work we propose an adaptive blockchain based authentication and authorization approach for IoT use cases. We provided a real implementation of our approach using Java language. The extensive evaluation provided, shows clearly the ability of our scheme in meeting the different requirements, as well as its ability in ensuring a very lightweight cost.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) interconnects thousands of sensor nodes to support the services of Internet of Things (IoT). However, data collected from sensor nodes may be tempered, forged and divulged. Traditional WSN data process platform handle the data centralized in terminal devices which is vulnerable to attacks and reduce the security of the system. Blockchain is a kind of distributed databases. It has been successfully applied in finance, securities, digital currency and other fields. We first propose a blockchain-based distributed collocation storage architecture for data security process platform of WSN with consensus protocol and asymmetric signature scheme. The security and efficiency are verified on the simulation to enable blockchain as a good solution.

AB Benefit from the capabilities of providing decentralized tamper-proof ledgers and platforms for data-driven autonomous organization, open-access blockchains based on proofof-work protocols have gained tremendous popularity. Yet, the proof-of-work based consensus protocols under threats, e.g., double-spending. In this paper, by adopting the cyber-insurance as an economic tool to neutralize cyber risks, we propose a novel approach of cyber risk management for blockchain-based service. The blockchain service market under our consideration is composed of four entities, i.e., the infrastructure provider, blockchain provider, cyber-insurer, and users. The blockchain provider purchases the computing resources, e.g., a cloud, from the infrastructure provider to maintain the blockchain consensus and then offers blockchain services to the users. The blockchain provider optimize its profit by strategizing its investment in the infrastructure in order to improve the security of the blockchain and the service price charged to the users. In the meantime, to prevent the potential damage incurred by the attacks and then fully secure the cyber-space, the blockchain provider purchases a cyber-insurance from the cyber-insurer. In return, the cyber-insurer adjusts the insurance premium according to the perceived risk level of the blockchain service and will pay the claim to the blockchain provider once attacks happen. Based on the rationality of the market entities, we model the interaction among the blockchain provider, users, and cyber-insurer as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Specifically, the blockchain provider and cyber-insurer lead to set their pricing/investment strategies in the upper level subgame, and then the users follow to determine their demand of the blockchain service in the lower level subgame. Specifically, we consider the scenario of double-spending attacks and provide a series of analytical results about the Stackelberg equilibrium in the market game.

AB With the explosive growth of smart IoT devices at the edge of the Internet, embedding sensors on mobile devices for massive data collection and collective environment sensing has been envisioned as a cost-effective solution for IoT applications. However, existing IoT platforms and framework rely on dedicated middleware for (semi-)centralized task dispatching, data storage and incentive provision. Consequently, they are usually expensive to deploy, have limited adaptability to diverse requirements, and face a series of data security and privacy issues. In this paper, we employ permissionless blockchains to construct a purely decentralized platform for data storage and trading in a wireless-powered IoT crowdsensing system. In the system, IoT sensors use the power wirelessly transferred from RF-energy beacons for data sensing and transmission to an access point. The data is then forwarded to the blockchain for distributed ledger services, i.e., data/transaction verification, recording, and maintenance. Due to the coupled interference of wireless transmission and the transaction fee incurred by the blockchain's distributed ledger services, rational sensors have to decide on their transmission rates to maximize their individual payoff. Thus, we formulate a noncooperative game model to analyze this competitive situation among the sensors. We provide the analytical condition for the existence of the Nash equilibria as well as a series of insightful numerical results about the equilibrium strategies in the game.

AB Block chaining technology has rapidly become a new global hotspot after the Internet in the field of financial technology (Fintech), attracting close attention from governments, experts and scholars. In practice, the specific meaning of "financial science and technology"is different under different backgrounds, and there are differences and connections with the concept of "Internet finance"in China. Fintech (Financial Technology) is a financial innovation based on artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, block chain technology and mobile Internet technology. Financial technology (Fintech) has been developing rapidly because of its obvious advantages in boosting the development of Inclusive Finance. The development of Fintech has played a certain role in the transformation of traditional financial institutions and the innovation of business models. Fintech has promoted the innovation of regulatory mechanism and the innovation of regulatory framework. Financial technology is an innovative activity to transform the mode of production in financial industry by means of science and technology, and thus to improve financial productivity. The development of information technology provides a necessary prerequisite for financial and technological progress. Based on its characteristics of centralization, privacy and programmability, block chain technology has the possibility of innovating the traditional financial payment system theoretically.

AB Privacy-preserving outsourcing algorithms for feature extraction not only reduce users' storage and computation overhead but also preserve the image privacy. However, the existing schemes still suffer from deficiencies induced by security, applications, efficiency and storage. To solve the problems, we implement a consortium chain-based outsourcing feature extraction scheme over encrypted images by using the smart contract, distributed autonomous corporation (DAC), sharding technique, and device to device (D2D) communication, which is secure, widely applied, highly efficient, and has less storage overhead. First, the effectiveness, security, and performance of our scheme are analyzed. Then, the efficiency and storage overhead of our scheme are presented by conducting experimental results.

AB The appearance of Bitcoin has brought an alternative to traditional money. However, beside its advantages consisting in secured, cheaper and faster transactions, borderless use, anonymity of the participants and lack of inflation, which makes it attractive for many people, Bitcoin also generates significant threats not only towards banks and economy, in general, but also to the society. Its private nature, beyond the supervision of any authority and especially the anonymity ensured for the participants in transactions with Bitcoin opens possibilities of using it in money laundering and terrorism activities, but also for speculative attacks on traditional currencies. Moreover, intermediating the sales of goods and services it interferes with traditional payment systems and may affect the monetary policies of governments from all over the world, including European Union countries. Therefore, debating on the issue of finding ways to regulate the use of Bitcoin in order to prevent such threats become justified and led us to the conclusion that beyond the need of regulations to be created by each country, because of its borderless use, there needed also regulatory measures to be taken on global scale by institutions like IMF or European Commission. Moreover, because of its dual nature, for regulating Bitcoin there is a need to combine the legislation applicable to traditional currencies with the one applicable to financial assets.

In this work, we create a model of the selection process performed by mining pools on the set of unconfirmed transactions and then attempt to predict if an unconfirmed transaction will be part of the next block by treating it as a supervised classification problem. We identified a vector of features obtained through service monitoring of the Bitcoin transaction network and performed our experiments on a publicly available dataset of Bitcoin transaction.

Producers and consumers interact with this contract sending their offers and bids accordingly and the contract clears the market based on a double auction model. We propose four different approaches for implementing, through the Ethereum platform, both the P2P network as well as the smart contract. We systematically compare the above approaches on the basis of their decentralization nature, operating costs, computational costs, effectiveness, security, privacy and beyond. This comparison is achieved through large scale, real time simulations based on the GridLAB-D platform.

AB Today's commercial model for edge computing services consists in lightweight devices at the network edge connected through the Internet to remote cloud data centers. Microclouds are an alternative vision of edge computing, where the cloud infrastructure runs at the network edge leveraging decentralized resource contributions of a community. But current attempts to build such microclouds lack a collaborative governance system to operate successfully. In this paper we discuss the opportunity to implement with blockchain technologies key services to enable the decentralized collaborative governance of microclouds. A multi agent approach could further contribute to improve the efficiency in the decision making in the collaborative governance service.

AB Many Internet services require the registration of an account before permitting use of their services. Over time, many Internet users end up with a multitude of accounts with separated identities. A solution to this problem is offered by single-sign-on (SSO) providers, where a user can create a single identity and use this identity for multiple services. However it requires the user to trust the SSO provider. When the provider blocks access to the identities the users lose access to their subscribed services. To avoid this problem, we propose DecentID, a completely decentralized identity storage system that does not require a centralized trusted third party. Instead, a public blockchain is used as trust anchor. Identities can be created and used for different services. Each service can only read the identity attributes disclosed for it without being able to read attributes the user wants to keep secret.

AB Botnets provide the foundation for a wide range of malicious activities on the Internet. Sophisticated Command and Control (C&C) infrastructures aim to prevent the detection and takedown of botnets and therefore pose a big challenge in the battle against network attacks of all kinds. In this paper, we present ChainChannels, a method for hidden botnet communication that exploits the digital signatures used in blockchains to inject subliminal messages. We show how subliminal messages can be included in signatures and distributed in blockchain transactions to the bots. We also show how the keying material required for extracting the subliminal information can be transmitted privately to the bots while being stored on a public blockchain. As proof of concept, we inject a subliminal message and a key in the Bitcoin blockchain and show how this information can be extracted from the transactions.
   Our method allows to establish a hidden C&C infrastructure over blockchains and send instructions to all bots without leaving any suspicious communication activities. The method relies only on digital signatures and is therefore applicable to numerous blockchains. The subliminal communication can not be distinguished from legitimate transactions, and mitigation would require redesigning blockchains to use new subliminal-free signature schemes. Our method provides a general hidden distribution channel over blockchains and can be also applied to other scenarios where information needs to be transmitted covertly. It scales extremely well with the number of receivers (i.e., bots), and subliminal messages can even be distributed over different blockchains to exploit specific features of blockchains such as low transaction cost or fast confirmation times or to further obfuscate the existence of the C&C communication.

AB The Cryptography is the way to secure the personal information in the 21st century. Nowadays a big challenge is the approach to the quantum computational power which it will be the end for the actual cryptosystems. In the public key ciphers the modulo operation is the core because the Euclid algorithm will increase the computational power needed by the eavesdropper. It seams that the new direction on the internet architecture, blockchain, can be a valuable direction for the public key cryptography survival. Here, a new idea on generating hashes will be introduced by using chaotic behaviour and statistical independence.

AB In order to solve the problems occurring in the current data collection apps, the methodologies of blockchain including decentralized data transmission, transaction security, data privacy, and permanent data storage are adopted in the Exercise and Diet Architecture (EDA). In EDA, personal data is stored and transferred under the secure mechanism in the blockchain network In which, all data are protected through secure hash algorithm and digital signature, which could be decrypt only through the corresponding key. Moreover, all transactions are transmitted in privacy because of the peer to peer transmission method. Thus, EDA is designed for storing data in a fully privacy and security environment.

AB Under some applications, identity-authentication must be involved into block-chain systems. However, the introduction of traditional PKI mechanism in block-chain systems is not proper for 3 reasons: (1) a centralized certification authority (CA) represents a single point of failure in the network; (2) the numbers and locations of nodes vary in time; (3) it introduces additional centralized factors in the block-chain system that is already decentralized. For the sake of decentralization multi-CA scenario is considered to distribute CA-functionality to nodes. Further, armed with secret sharing scheme, a practical distributed CA-based PKI scheme is proposed that is well-associated with existed mechanisms (such as POW) in the original system. Finally, solutions of verification and multi-level assigning issues are constructed via verifiable secret sharing and multilevel secret sharing tools.

AB This paper presents a stochastic model for block arrival times based on the difficulty retargeting rule used in Bitcoin, as well as other proof-of-work blockchains. Unlike some previous work, this paper explicitly models the difficulty target as a random variable which is a function of the previous block arrival times and affecting the block times in the next retargeting period. An explicit marginal distribution is derived for the time between successive blocks (the blocktime), while allowing for randomly changing difficulty. This paper also aims to serve as an introduction to Bitcoin and proof-of-work blockchains for the controls community, focusing on the difficulty retargeting procedure used in Bitcoin.

AB Blockchain has received much attention in recent years. This immense popularity has raised a number of concerns, scalability of blockchain systems being a common one. In this paper, we seek to understand how Ethereum, a well-established blockchain system, would respond to sharding. Sharding is a prevalent technique to increase the scalability of distributed systems. To understand how sharding would affect Ethereum, we model Ethereum blockchain as a graph and evaluate five methods to partition the graph. We assess methods using three metrics: the balance among shards, the number of transactions that would involve multiple shards, and the amount of data that would be relocated across shards upon repartitioning of the graph.

TI The abstraction of money, emancipation or alienation?
SO DIGITHUM
AB This article aims to give an account of the abstraction undergone by money since the beginning of modernity. Calling on both theoretical developments (such as Georg Simmel's) and social practice and even technical aspects, one of its central objectives is to pose a series of questions regarding digital currencies, particularly bitcoin, which, despite initially promising to be anti- capitalist, has, in fact, become its most sophisticated tool. Starting with two general views of money (functional and historical- political), the article then zooms in on a number of ideas that have come about since the end of the nineteenth century regarding the "dematerialization" of currency. Finally, it outlines questions on bitcoin and concludes with a reflection on the autonomization of money in light of the alienation of contemporary subjectivity.

AB The growing demand for safety in urban environments is supported by monitoring using video surveillance. The need to analyze multiple video-flows from different cameras deployed around the city by heterogeneous owners introduces vulnerabilities and privacy issues. Video frames, timestamps, and camera settings can be digitally manipulated by malicious users; the positions of cameras, their orientation and their mechanical settings can be physically manipulated. Digital and physical manipulations may have several effects, including the change of the observed scene and the potential violation of neighbors' privacy. To face these risks, we introduce BlockSee, a blockchain-based video surveillance system that jointly provides validation and immutability to camera settings and surveillance videos, making them readily available to authorized users in case of events. The encouraging results obtained with BlockSee pave the way to new distributed city-wide monitoring systems.

AB Communication and automation was limited to the interaction between machine and the user with user being the operator of the machine. Industry 4.0 driven by IoT has brought the tectonic shift on how the communication happens which is not just limited to Human-Machine interaction but also Machine-Machine data exchange. This has led to new form of automation with physical systems/resources connected to internet and indeed with each other. These interconnected devices generate large amount of data which when deciphered properly can provide us with range of different applications in every possible sector. Manufacturing industries in India being at the forefront of this implementation currently, IoT provides best of communication and automation techniques to increase productivity and profits.

AB With the growing adoption of machine learning, sharing of learned models is becoming popular. However, in addition to the prediction properties the model producer aims to share, there is also a risk that the model consumer can infer other properties of the training data the model producer did not intend to share. In this paper, we focus on the inference of global properties of the training data, such as the environment in which the data was produced, or the fraction of the data that comes from a certain class, as applied to white-box Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNNs).
   Because of their complexity and inscrutability, FCNNs have a particularly high risk of leaking unexpected information about their training sets; at the same time, this complexity makes extracting this information challenging. We develop techniques that reduce this complexity by noting that FCNNs are invariant under permutation of nodes in each layer. We develop our techniques using representations that capture this invariance and simplify the information extraction task. We evaluate our techniques on several synthetic and standard benchmark datasets and show that they are very effective at inferring various data properties.
   We also perform two case studies to demonstrate the impact of our attack. In the first case study we show that a classifier that recognizes smiling faces also leaks information about the relative attractiveness of the individuals in its training set. In the second case study we show that a classifier that recognizes Bitcoin mining from performance counters also leaks information about whether the classifier was trained on logs from machines that were patched for the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.

AB Supply Chain Financing (SCF) provides the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with special access to loan based on supply chain, dragging numerous enterprises out of financing dilemma. At the same time, banks also have to face with risks coming with SCF. This paper mainly explores SCF pledge risk controlling taking advantage of block chain technology, which is known for information transparency and tamper proof, and proposes a strategy of Real Time Stare in Market (RTSM) to mitigate risk pressure brought by pledge of movables. Once the total value of pledge drops below the level of safety, replenishment is required. Numerical experiments results show that banks can avoid risk of pledge and even gain more from RTSM strategy.

AB The current e-business information retrieval system ignores the threat of distributed denial of service attack from computer network, which results in low retrieval recall, accuracy, and efficiency. For this problem, a design method of fuzzy retrieval system for e-business information based on block chain technology is proposed in this paper. A fuzzy retrieval system of e-business information is designed, which includes three layers of client, application server and data server. The construction rules of the rule library used by the system are researched. The keyword expansion method of association word list, compound word list and synonymous word list is given. The dynamic knowledge base of the system is built and updated in real-time. Security control of e-business information documents in the system is implemented by using anti-attack performance of block chain technology. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the recall, accuracy and average accuracy of the system and the retrieval efficiency is high.

AB The Bitcoin backbone protocol (Eurocrypt 2015) extracts basic properties of Bitcoin's underlying blockchain data structure, such as "common prefix" and "chain quality," and shows how fundamental applications including consensus and a robust public transaction ledger can be built on top of them. The underlying assumptions are " proofs of work" (POWs), adversarial hashing power strictly less than 1/2 and no adversarial pre-computation-or, alternatively, the existence of an unpredictable "genesis" block.
   In this paper we first show how to remove the latter assumption, presenting a "bootstrapped" Bitcoin-like blockchain protocol relying on POWs that builds genesis blocks "from scratch" in the presence of adversarial pre-computation. Importantly, the round complexity of the genesis block generation process is independent of the number of participants.
   Next, we consider applications of our construction, including a PKI generation protocol and a consensus protocol without trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power). Previous results in the same setting (unauthenticated parties, no trusted setup, POWs) required a round complexity linear in the number of participants.

Nevertheless, we believe that the resolution time could be shorter with slight changes in the communication system between the pharmacist and other health professionals, increasing the quality of healthcare and the efficiency of the national health system.

This paper proposes a forensic analysis tool that acts during the final stage of the ransomware infection cycle to provide a quick and easy option to acquire valuable information for the forensic analyst in order to facilitate the subsequent classification of ransomware. The proposed tool combines pop-up window capture showing the ransomware and through the optical character recognition techniques, obtaining the rescue message along with the payment address and value. In addition, it extracts the files generated by the ransomware and dumps the virtual memory of the system for analysis by the forensic technician. To evaluate the accuracy of the tool, experiments were conducted with different samples of ransomware on a real computer, under a controlled environment.

Hitherto, no research has yet systematically investigated the factors that influencing users' intention to invest in cryptocurrency. Thus, this study is aimed to develop an understanding regarding cryptocurrency investment by investigating the intention to invest in cryptocurrency; in this case is Bitcoin. This paper is a conceptual paper that extends the applicability of Theory of Reason Action (TRA) by incorporating perceived risk and perceived benefits as the additional variables from cryptocurrency investment context. Being limited to conceptual evidence, this study lacks the empirical evidence. Future works are needed to be done to establish the empirical support on the association of the studied variables.

AB We describe a general attack on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains without checkpointing. Our attack leverages transaction fees, the ability to treat transactions "out of context," and the standard longest chain rule to completely dominate a blockchain. The attack grows in power with the number of honest transactions and the stake held by the adversary, and can be launched by an adversary controlling any constant fraction of the stake.
   With the present statistical profile of blockchain protocols, the attack can be launched given a few years of prior blockchain operation; hence it is within the realm of feasibility for PoS protocols. Most importantly, it demonstrates how closely transaction fees and rewards are coupled with the security properties of PoS protocols. More broadly, our attack must be reflected and countered in any future PoS design that avoids checkpointing, as well as any effort to remove checkpointing from existing protocols. We describe several mechanisms for protecting against the attack that include context-sensitivity of transactions and chain density statistics.

AB Zero-knowledge SNARKs (zk-SNARKs) are non-interactive proof systems with short and efficiently verifiable proofs. They elegantly resolve the juxtaposition of individual privacy and public trust, by providing an efficient way of demonstrating knowledge of secret information without actually revealing it. To this day, zk-SNARKs are being used for delegating computation, electronic cryptocurrencies, and anonymous credentials. However, all current SNARKs implementations rely on pre-quantum assumptions and, for this reason, are not expected to withstand cryptanalitic efforts over the next few decades.
   In this work, we introduce the first designated-verifier zk-SNARK based on lattice assumptions, which are believed to be post-quantum secure. We provide a generalization in the spirit of Gennaro et al. (Eurocrypt'13) to the SNARK of Danezis et al. (Asiacrypt'14) that is based on Square Span Programs (SSPs) and relies on weaker computational assumptions. We focus on designated-verifier proofs and propose a protocol in which a proof consists of just 5 LWE encodings. We provide a concrete choice of parameters as well as extensive benchmarks on a C implementation, showing that our construction is practically instantiable.

AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital decentralized cryptocurrency created by an individual under pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. In fact, it is the first digital decentralized currency. The importance of digital cryptocurrency and the concept of blockchain have been explored by several developers and organizations. It is assumed to be one of the secure and easy payment methods that can be used in the coming days. In this paper, we survey various topics under Bitcoin such as blocks, blockchains, mining process and proof of work(PoW).

AB In this paper, we analyze the value of smart contracts and blockchains as an alternative to traditional contractual obligations. In particular, we start by exploring some of the advantages of these technologies, specifically the immutability of blockchains and automated contract remittance. We also discuss two critical shortcomings of decentralized smart contracts, namely regulatory uncertainty and a lack of confidential execution. With these issues in mind, we next explore how American legislators have begun to address smart contracts and blockchains. Though quite limited, there have been a few provisions clarifying the status of these technologies. We break down some of the language expressed in these bills so as to understand the current legal status of smart contracts and blockchains. Given this foundation, we consider the next steps that should be taken as smart contracts mature. This pertains to both the continued improvement of the underlying technology as well as the progress taken by regulators. Finally, assuming a futuristic scenario where there are no technological or regulatory barriers to smart contract adoption, we discuss how the process of contract remittance can be expedited in a world fully committed to the use of smart contracts.

AB Current methods for obtaining data consent from legal guardians are limited to paper forms and human data entry. While this classic method of granting consent is familiar to the parties involved, it involves little accountability or ongoing access oversight. Parents are asked to sign multiple permission forms, but are not given an efficient manner by which they can differentiate between fields for consent nor keep track of usage. Blockchain technology represents a promising approach for developing 'smart contracts', digital promises to be executed without reliance upon a legal intermediary. Utilizing Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer, we propose a framework of nested authorization, allowing a public school data administrator the ability to grant authorization rights to a third party after-school intervention program and their volunteers, who meet with parents and obtain consent for data access rights relying on smart contracts. These data consent signatures allow researchers the ability to design targeted inventions, meeting the needs of the community.

AB In this paper, we consider the problem of fair scheduling of transactions of multiple types that are submitted to a permissioned blockchain system. Permissioned blockchains are being increasingly used for enterprise applications and by design are heterogeneous in nature, with different peer organizations performing different business functions. Transactions execute different smart contract operations that may have widely varying business importance. In such a setting, we argue that the typically adopted First-In-First-Out ordering mechanism for transactions in a blockchain system, which is a performance-limited resource, is inefficient and unfair. We propose a weighted fair queueing strategy for ordering transactions that can support differentiated quality of service for submitted transactions on the blockchain. The main challenge we address in this paper is to support fair allocation and differentiation in a decentralized manner, as there is no single authority that can facilitate this as in traditional systems. We demonstrate such a fair scheduling strategy and support multiple transaction types with different priorities on Hyperledger Fabric.

AB In mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), reputation systems and price-based systems have been proposed. These systems require management systems for trust and reward. Due to the characteristics of MANET, the management systems are required to securely manage reputation and reward in a distributed manner. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Management system for Trust and Reward in MANET, called DMTR. DMTR can effectively detect uncooperative nodes which drop packets illegally. DMTR is utilising a blockchain which is a technique to manage virtual credit in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. DMTR sets "mining nodes" which play a role of managing the blockchain and introduces cooperative mining to accelerate settlement speed while keeping security. We confirm the efficiency of DMTR in network performances by simulation.

AB Blockchain is a disruptive technology with the potential to have a significant impact on business models and industries, similar to the adoption of Internet. Blockchain promotes distributed, open, inclusive, immutable, and secure architectural approaches, instead of centralized, hidden, exclusive, and alterable alternatives. The adoption of blockchain in the healthcare domain offers promising solutions for securing communications among stakeholders, efficient delivery of clinical reports, and integrating various kinds of private health records of individuals on a secure infrastructure. Accordingly, the main aim of this study is to propose a holistic blockchain structure covering all stakeholders in the healthcare domain and to analyse opportunities and challenges by presenting an integrated blockchain architecture. The comprehensive view of blockchain based healthcare system consists of services as follows: personal medical health record storage and access, personal genomic data storage and access, inventory tracking and buy-sell mechanism, health research commons, health document notary services, doctor services, digital health wallet, peer-to peer insurance. The opportunities of using blockchain in the healthcare domain are considered with respect to several viewpoints such as transparency, accountability, decentralization, record accuracy, secure transactions, interoperability, lower costs, collaboration, agility, individualized care with specialized treatment, improved diagnosis methods, risk of insurance contract, prevention of counterfeit drugs and improved quality of medical research. Challenges associated with the implementation of blockchain in the healthcare domain are also highlighted, such as governance, lack of legacy, privacy, sustainability, scalability, adoption of participation, and cost of operations.

AB The evolution of the world of energy towards a system of decentralized production and consumption assets makes it possible to understand better the upcoming industrial revolution, which will be one of distributed information flows. A new paradigm, the "blockchain", enables economic actors to completely decentralize information flows without intermediaries. Even though many technological locks still exist today, it becomes possible already today to imagine that each machine or connected object will be able to communicate autonomously and securely with others, learn and enrich its mode of operation thanks to artificial intelligence technologies. The business models will be strongly impacted by a greater flexibility of the manufacturing capacities, their adaptation in real time to consumer constraints and the optimization of supply management (raw material, energy and components) through smart purchase, onsite production, 3D-printing and smart logistics: a fractal production with shorter supply channels steered by resources and energy efficiency data.

AB This publication explores global problem areas where properties offered by Blockchain provide workable solutions for the existing widely unsolved problems of Accountability, Traceability, Identification, Visibility vs. Privacy, and Connection of Non-Deterministic to Deterministic timed events. Using BlockChain-based transactions, we demonstrate that operations related to trust are reducible to five directly implementable cryptographic actions, which then create relationships to five categories of trust that we define in this document. The solution outlined will take the approach that the identified global problems will be solved by blockchain as cybersecurity of the future moves in a direction of individualized transactional-based security & privacy. Developers and organizations looking to implement new solutions or integrate blockchain into existing applications would be interested in this publication. Methods described provide workable solutions for implementing trust relationships using blockchain for positive use cases which can be related directly to cyber security industry solutions.

AB The paper presents the concept of renewable energy management system. The idea behind the system is to exploit the potential of renewable energy generation sources so as to provide additional energy services and participation in a competitive energy market. These actions can significantly affect the shortening of the period of return on investment of individual customer in renewable energy sources. The paper contains a concept of Electricity Consumption and Supply Management System (ECSM) with application of blockchain technology. ECSM provides functionality to monitor and record continuously information about inbound and outbound energy to/from power grid. Except monitoring inbound and outbound energy, solution will provide the possibility to manage in automatic and manual way when energy should be sent to energy grid. Information about inbound/outbound energy will be part of smart contract which will be confirmed and stored in every node.

AB This study reports empirical results of a survey on consumer trust in trustless trust facilities provided by distributed ledger technologies, using the example of an app that obtains product-related information from a blockchain. We report results from 82 respondents who were familiarized with the features of the app under consideration. The novelty of this study is that we provide an assessment of consumers' trust regarding the concept of trustless trust. The relevance for practitioners arises from the abundance of quality certifications, eco-labels and product reviews that add confusion rather than orientation to consumer decision processes at the moment of truth (on- or off-line buying decisions) in combination with the increasing popularity of smart contracts, which can be used to store all the relevant information about product details and processing along the supply chain.

AB The water companies should provide services at the affordable tariffs for all people, irrespective of the water source, geographical area, size or complexity of water supply system. In order to contribute to the sustainability of water distribution infrastructure, tariffs should cover, in practice, at least the operating and maintenance costs. To obtain a lower water tariff, the water-energy nexus should be take into account. Thus, developing the innovative technological solutions which to allow new water pricing options and policy actions based on energy efficiency measures and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to implement the EU water policy represent a new research direction. The paper proposes an innovative solution represented by a software platform for a sustainable management of water supply systems which to include the advanced ICT solutions (Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence) and smart concepts (smart metering, demand response) with benefits both energy and water fields. The platform could lead to realize significant energy and savings through technical measures and a smart management, supplying the consumers with quality water at an affordable tariff considering the socio-economic factors.

AB Removing the need for a trusted third party, blockchain technology revolutionizes the field of identity management. Service providers rely on digital identities to securely identify, authenticate and authorize users to their services. Traditionally, these digital identities are offered by a central identity provider belonging to a specific organisation. Trust in the digital identity mainly originates from the identity provider's reputation, organizational functioning and contractual obligations. Blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralized identity management without a central identity provider as trusted third party. Therefore, the derivation of trust in digital identities within this paradigm requires a distinct approach. In this paper we propose a novel general quantifiable trust model and a specific implementation variant for blockchain-based identity management. Applying the model, trust is deduced in a decentralized manner from attestations of claims and applied to the associated digital identity. This concept replaces trust with a central identity provider by aggregated trust into attestation issuers. Thus, promoting self-sovereign identities to be fit for purpose. The calculated numerical trust metric serves as independent basis for the definition of assurance levels to simplify and automate reasoning about trust by service providers without requiring a dedicated evaluation of a trusted third party.

AB Since the security and fault tolerance is the two important metrics of the data storage, it brings both opportunities and challenges for distributed data storage and transaction. The traditional transaction system of storage resources, which generally runs in a centralized mode, results in high cost, vendor lock-in, single point failure risk, DDoS attack and information security. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed transaction method for cloud storage based on smart contract. First, to guarantee the fault tolerance and decrease the storing cost for erasure coding, a VCG-based auction mechanism is proposed for storage transaction, and we deploy and implement the proposed mechanism by designing a corresponding smart contract. Especially, we address the problem - how to implement a VCG-like mechanism in a blockchain environment. Based on private chain of Ethereum, we make the simulations for proposed storage transaction method. The results showed that proposed transaction model can realize competitive trading of storage resources, and ensure the safe and economic operation of resource trading.

AB With the gradual promotion, crowdsourcing has become an efficient way to solve problems that are very complicated for computers and simple for human crowd intelligence in recent years. Traditional crowdsourcing is based on a central system where requesters post tasks on a crowdsourcing central server or platform, however, this centralized model currently faces various challenges such as prohibitive cost, single point of failure, and vulnerability to malicious attacks. To this end, this paper proposes a smart contract-based decentralized online crowdsourcing mechanism, which includes task assignment rules and reward payment rules, etc. The mechanism has the characteristics like decentralization, unalterable, truthfulness and so on. In addition, the corresponding smart contract is designed, so that the mechanism can really run and process the actual data, and the effectiveness is shown by experiments. In this way, the entire crowdsourcing process no longer requires the participation of trusted third-party agencies, information and privacy security is guaranteed, and the cost is lower.

AB With the development of information and communication technology, the amount of data in the world is increasing dramatically every day. Now data has been recognized as a valuable asset, and monetization from valuable data becomes an urgent need. In light of this, many data trading platforms have emerged in recent years. Existing data trading schemes, however, generally rely on a third party to trade data. These schemes suffer from complex transaction process, high transaction cost, and possibly unfair exchange. In this paper, we propose two secure, fair and efficient data trading schemes that do not rely on any third party using blockchain. The first scheme achieves direct raw data exchange for large amount of data, while the second scheme achieves data statistics trading. We implement both our schemes with smart contracts, and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate their performance. The experiment results show that they are highly efficient in trading data: the first scheme can trade 100,000 data records within 1.51s, while the second scheme can process a statistic over a data set of 1,024 records within 1.99s.

AB Peace engineering implies taking positive and proactive actions to promote peace and justice. Blockchain, on the other hand, is a distributed sequence of blocks which acts like a public ledger. Motivations to develop blockchain based systems are usually related to transparency and trust. Inherently, blockchain ideals relate to peace engineering because of the way users can manage information globally: transparently and confidently. Application of blockchain in higher education may represent a fundamental change in the way professors deliver contents, manage courses, and even assess student work. Moreover, higher education institutions can find blockchain useful as it has the potential to change the way of providing certifications and the way knowledge is managed, produced, and shared. In this work, we review previous works that address blockchain implementation in higher education highlighting implementation advantages and possible disadvantages. Additionally, we explore further potential applications of smart contracts as a tool in blockchain based approaches to enhance engineering education programs.

AB Imposter devices pose serious threats. The majority of low-cost edge devices can easily be counterfeited or cloned; the supply chain is insufficiently secure. Reliability of deployed devices can be called into question simply because they might be counterfeit or cloned. It is a must to identify edge devices' sourcing uniquely and verify their validity periodically at runtime. We integrate blockchain technology to authenticate resource-constrained, low-cost edge devices. We use SRAM-based physically unclonable functions (PUFs) to generate unique "digital fingerprints" (device IDs). Registered manufacturers upload a cryptographic hash of each device ID to a "globally accessible" blockchain instance (key-value store or smart contract). While registering/ designating a device locally, the end-user verifies whether the hash is present in that blockchain. We utilize a "locally permissioned" blockchain infrastructure (which is still a globally managed blockchain or, in future, a sidechain) to authenticate edge devices for a defense-in-depth approach. Devices can authenticated periodically to prevent device cloning. Target environments can be large and have varied trust among users and lack a specific perimeter; this "local" blockchain methodology is thus pertinent, especially since blockchains gain security over time. Our approach reduces the potential for classes of information leakage and types of sabotage in a critical infrastructure or large-scale deployment (such as a smart city) arising from imposter devices. This methodology protects against such imposters in mobile settings within an IoT infrastructure too.

AB Poverty alleviation loan plays an important role in the poverty alleviation strategy of China. To improve the loan service efficiency and reduce service cost, it is necessary to build a management system for this business. However, current management systems for the loan are usually deployed in single service mode, also the transactions are not transparent and traceable to most of the roles participating in the process. Its data privacy protection mechanism is not robust enough facing various cyber attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose loan on blockchain (LoC), a novel poverty alleviation loan management system based on smart contracts. A digital account model is designed for the transfer of assets between centralized and decentralized ledgers, and locking and unlocking algorithms are introduced for smart contracts. Digital signature and oracle are introduced to protect the data privacy.

AB Bitcoin is one of the most prominent decentralized digital cryptocurrencies. Ability to understand which factors drive the fluctuations of the Bitcoin price and to what extent they are predictable is interesting both from the theoretical and practical perspective. In this paper, we study the problem of the Bitcoin short-term volatility forecasting based on volatility history and order book data. Order book, consisting of buy and sell orders over time, reflects the intention of the market and is closely related to the evolution of volatility. We propose temporal mixture models capable of adaptively exploiting both volatility history and order book features. By leveraging rolling and incremental learning and evaluation procedures, we demonstrate the prediction performance of our model as well as studying the robustness, in comparison to a variety of statistical and machine learning baselines. Meanwhile, our temporal mixture model enables to decipher the time-varying effect of order book features on volatility. It demonstrates the prospect of our temporal mixture model as an interpretable forecasting framework over heterogeneous Bitcoin data.

AB In this paper, we discuss the problem of efficiently handling temporal queries on Hyperledger Fabric, a popular implementation of Blockchain technology. The temporal nature of the data inserted by the Hyperledger Fabric transactions can be leveraged to support various use-cases. This requires that the temporal queries be processed efficiently on this data. Currently this presents significant challenges as this data is organized on file-system, is exposed to users via a limited API and does not support any temporal indexes.
   We present two models for overcoming these limitations and improving the performance of temporal queries on Fabric. The first model creates a copy of each event inserted by a Fabric transaction and stores temporally close events together on Fabric. The second model keeps the event count intact but tags some metadata to each event being inserted on Fabric s.t. temporally close events share the same metadata. We discuss these two models in detail and show that these two models significantly outperform the naive ways of handling temporal queries on Fabric. We also discuss the performance trade-offs for these two models across various dimensions - data storage, query performance, data ingestion time etc.

AB In the world of technology, change is the only constant. As soon as people start adapting to a new invention, another innovation starts paving its way into people's lives. Each change in technology brings in new and improved devices. Old devices are replaced and abandoned. Such Electronic and Electrical Equipments (EEEs) that are discarded by users are termed as e-waste. Management of e-waste includes proper collection, segregation and recycling of discarded devices in an environment friendly manner. The volume of EEEs that is produced throughout the world, has led governments in various countries to create strict policies, to ensure efficient disposal of the generated e-waste. The Indian government also upgraded its E-Waste Management (EWM) laws in 2016 and 2018. These laws are a step towards environment friendly disposal of e-waste but their compliance is still at a nascent stage. Even today, e-waste collection and recycling in India is largely dominated by the unorganized sector, which makes the enforcement of such laws very difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for EWM using blockchain based smart contracts. Blockchain is the technology that enables us to write smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing computer codes that take specified actions when certain conditions are met in the real world. EWM using smart contracts will bring more coordination among producers, importers, retailers and recyclers of EEEs. It will enable the government to regulate e-waste collection and recycling. It will also reduce the imbalance between the organized and unorganized sectors which will lead to increased transparency throughout the process.

AB Energy conservation measurements in buildings are more and more popular as they benefit from an intelligent contractual framework called Energy Performance Contracts (EPC), where energy savings are measured as the difference between a predictive baseline model and the actual consumption. While modern predictive models make use of large amounts of data from external sources and increasingly complex algorithms, these two aspects make their use difficult in practice because they need mutual understanding and transparency, requiring the involvement of a third-party for auditing. In this sense, we designed and developed a prototype that overcomes these issues by storing the predictive models and the data in an immutable blockchained data structure using the Ethereum framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first working prototype using the blockchain technology applied to EPCs. This paper presents and discusses the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in this prototype.

AB Cryptocurrency wallets store the wallet's private key(s), and hence, are a lucrative target for attackers. With possession of the private key, an attacker virtually owns all of the currency in the compromised wallet. Managing cryptocurrency wallets offline, in isolated ('air-gapped') computers, has been suggested in order to secure the private keys from theft. Such air-gapped wallets are often referred to as 'cold wallets.'
   In this paper we show how private keys can be exfiltrated from air-gapped wallets. In the adversarial attack model, the attacker infiltrates the offline wallet, infecting it with malicious code. The malware can be preinstalled or pushed in during the initial installation of the wallet, or it can infect the system when removable media (e.g., USB flash drive) is inserted into the wallet's computer in order to sign a transaction. These attack vectors have repeatedly been proven feasible in the last decade (e.g., [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10]). Having obtained a foothold in the wallet, an attacker can utilize various air-gap covert channel techniques (bridgeware [11]) to jump the air-gap and exfiltrate the wallet's private keys. We evaluate various exfiltration techniques, including physical, electromagnetic, electric, magnetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal techniques. This research shows that although cold wallets provide a high degree of isolation, it's not beyond the capability of motivated attackers to compromise such wallets and steal private keys from them. We demonstrate how a 256-bit private key (e.g., Bitcoin's private keys) can be exfiltrated from an offline, air-gapped wallet of a fictional character named Satoshi within a matter of seconds.

AB Electronic Medical Records - EMR has been an increasingly major area of research in order to improve quality of health services, by reducing attention time, probability of errors and helping all the actors in the ecosystem for accountability and traceability. However, patients are probably one of the actors that, despite being the main actor to be protected by regulations, have the least access to its information and control over what, who, when, how and why other actors in the healthcare system are doing with their information, especially in cases where just the existence of some tests may reveal an illness or a condition that should remain private. There is existing work and regulations on defining user-centered access control to the data, but the options are usually focused on defining policies on who has access to the information. This work introduces an incremental data access options in order to increase privacy over the data by considering the possibility of offering slightly altered or obfuscated data as an option to protect the original information, revealing just enough to enable the desired services. A differential privacy classification of access is presented, tested on lab data and evaluated, showing that different levels of privacy protection can be used in certain cases and for a limited number of services, while preserving privacy of the data. In addition, this technique can be integrated with other access-control techniques in literature.

AB Recently blockchain technology has been introduced to execute interacting business processes in a secure and transparent way. While the foundations for process enactment on blockchain have been researched, the execution of decisions on blockchain has not been addressed yet. In this paper we argue that decisions are an essential aspect of interacting business processes, and, therefore, also need to be executed on blockchain. The immutable representation of decision logic can be used by the interacting processes, so that decision taking will be more secure, more transparent, and better auditable. The approach is based on a mapping of the DMN language S-FEEL to Solidity code to be run on the Ethereum blockchain. The work is evaluated by a proof-of-concept prototype and an empirical cost evaluation.

AB In comparing Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies, we analyze whether these can become a viable alternative to fiat currencies. In the theoretical part we assess if these embody the main functions of a currency (Krugman, 1984). The empirical part analyzes the price development, liquidity and velocity of Bitcoin in comparison to the major other cryptocurrencies in 2017. We conclude that Bitcoin Cash, a cryptocurrency that evolved during a hard fork of Bitcoin, may develop into sharing features of a global currency. Currently cryptocurrencies are rather tokens and a highly volatile asset class of their own.

AB The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is the de facto standard for communication inside the vehicle between its Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and the various sensors that are distributed throughout the body and powertrain of the vehicle. To date, the bus remains unprotected from network attacks, a situation that cannot persist, given the recent drive toward vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), which leaves a vehicle's electronic devices exposed to all sorts of network attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight encryption solution, reminiscent of Blockchain technology, that generates keys based on a CAN frame's payload and the previous key, thus rendering a robust solution. We describe our solution's design and its prototypical implementation, which we built to verify the functionality of our solution. We also validate our solution using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool.

AB Blockchain as a new technology has created a great amount of hype and hope for different applications. There is a promise of a better, decentralised trust based on strict guarantees from cryptography. However, there is a great similarity in the structure of blockchains and classical iterated hash functions of the Merkle-Damgard (M-D) type. As the structure of M-D type hash functions has been extensively studied and many different structural weaknesses have been exposed, it is plausible to think that blockchains also share these structural problems. In this paper, we present the most relevant problems of M-D type hash functions and their relation to blockchains. We also examine how these might affect currently established blockchains. Our results can help in avoiding some problems in the design of new blockchain systems and also provide some (theoretical) limits on the trustworthiness of current blockchains.

AB As proof-of-work blockchains are inherently energy greedy and offer probabilistic guarantees, blockchains based on Byzantine consensus appear as a promising technology to track billions of connected devices. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of prominent blockchains that solve the classic Byzantine consensus problem. Our results show that while offering reasonable throughput their performance usually do not scale to tens of devices and drops dramatically as the number of devices increases. This study motivates the need for solutions that solves the Blockchain consensus problem, a scalable variant of the classic Byzantine consensus problem but dedicated to blockchains.

AB With the success of Bitcoin, the technique behind it, Blockchain, is catching massive attention recently. Blockchain is a collection of several techniques like cryptology, P2P and distributed consensus protocol. The main idea of Blockchain is that nodes in the network keep the same distributed ledger. Because of this immutable ledger, a trusted bridge is built among parties without fully trust. Blockchain can be used in variety of areas, especially in financial fields, like supply chain management, cross-border payment and global bank settlement. Meanwhile, we can observe that mobile network is growing rapidly and nibbling the PC market. However, the current public Blockchain applications like Bitcoin or Ethereum require the nodes to store the whole ledger which exceeds the capacity of the mobile devices. Thus, we need to develop a blockchain platform to support mobile devices.
   In this demo, we introduce Jupiter, a mobile-based Blockchain platform which provides a novel concept called consensus unit (CU) to alleviate the storage problem of mobile. We present the system architecture and demonstrate several CU scenarios via Jupiter.

AB Outsourced data, as an significant component of cloud service, has been widely used due to its convince, low overhead and high flexibility. To guarantee the integrity of outsourced data and reduce the computational overhead, data owner (DO) usually adopts a third party auditor (TPA) to execute verification scheme. However, handing over the verification of data to TPA may lead to security vulnerabilities since the TPA is not fully trusted. In this paper, we propose a novel solution for data integrity verification in untrusted outsourced environment. Firstly, we design a decentralized model based on blockchain, consisting by some collaborative verification peers (VPs). Based on our purposed model, we present an advanced data integrity verification algorithm, allowing DO stores and checks verification results by writing and retrieving the blockchain. Moreover, each VP maintains a replication of the entire blockchain to avoid maliciously tampering with. We evaluate our proposed approach on real outsourced data service scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is efficient and effective.

AB At a time when society is in constant transition to keep up with technological advancement, we are seeing traditional paradigms being increasingly challenged. The fundamentals of governance are one such paradigm. As society's values have shifted, so have expectations of government shifted from the traditional model to something commonly referred to as 'open governance'. Though a disputed term, we take open governance to mean a concept, which encourages and facilitates openness, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens. For the success of open governance initiatives, there are some technologies, such as the internet, that are crucial. These technologies enable access to both the data and to engagement activities between citizens and government. There are also other technologies, like blockchain and smart contacts, which could be utilised to assist open governance. A sound starting point would be moving from a system where information is tediously released by a government, on an 'as they please' basis, to an infrastructure where critical actions are captured with strong integrity, non-repudiation and evidential guarantees. With an added dimension that facilitates these actions record be accessible to public scrutiny in near real-time. One candidate technology for capturing such actions is blockchain. Initially, blockchains were mainly used to facilitate cryptocurrencies as a record of transactions. The notable example being bitcoin. However, in recent years, blockchains utility is being recognised through smart contracts - potentially a vital building block to realising open and transparent government activities. In this paper, we employ the concept of smart contracts to government tendering activities. The proposed scheme is based on smart contracts, enabling a fair, transparent and independently verifiable (auditable) government tendering scheme. The scheme is then implemented on the Ethereum platform to evaluate the performance and financial cost implications, along with an evaluation of the potential security and auditability challenges.

AB Technology has positive impacts on many aspects of our social life. Designing a 24 hour globally connected architecture enables ease of access to a variety of resources and services. Furthermore, technology like the Internet has been a fertile ground for innovation and creativity. One such disruptive innovation is blockchain - a keystone of cryptocurrencies. The blockchain technology is presented as a game changer for many of the existing and emerging technologies/services. With its immutability property and decentralised architecture, it is taking centre stage in many services as an equalisation factor to the current parity between consumers and large corporations/governments. One potential application of the blockchain is in e-voting schemes. The objective of such a scheme would be to provide a decentralised architecture to run and support a voting scheme that is open, fair, and independently verifiable. In this paper, we propose a potential new e-voting protocol that utilises the blockchain as a transparent ballot box. The protocol has been designed to adhere to fundamental e-voting properties as well as offer a degree of decentralisation and allow for the voter to change/update their vote (within the permissible voting period). This paper highlights the pros and cons of using blockchain for such a proposal from a practical point view in both development/deployment and usage contexts. Concluding the paper is a potential roadmap for blockchain technology to be able to support complex applications.

AB Airdrops are a popular method of distributing cryptocurrencies and tokens. While often considered risk-free from the point of view of recipients, their impact on privacy is easily overlooked. We examine the Clam airdrop of 2014, a forerunner to many of today's airdrops, that distributed a new cryptocurrency to every address with a non-dust balance on the Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchains. Specifically, we use address clustering to try to construct the one-to-many mappings from entities to addresses on the blockchains, individually and in combination. We show that the sharing of addresses between the blockchains is a privacy risk. We identify instances where an entity has disclosed information about their address ownership on the Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin blockchains, exclusively via their activity on the Clam blockchain.

AB Innovation in cashless payment instruments can lead to complications in the use of quantity targets in monetary control. The empirical study found that the presence of non-cash payment instruments using cards can replace the role of cash payment instruments in economist transactions in Indonesia. The growth of electronic money when viewed on a monthly basis is much faster than the growth of debit and credit card cards, a monthly increase of electronic money can reach 70%-100%, while debit and credit card cards only grow in the range of 20%. This study aims to analyze the design of e-money, as well as provide some development ideas that must be done related to the implementation of e-money.

AB Peacekeeping and humanitarian aid interventions in Somalia have attempted to bring peace and stability' to the country and region for more than twenty-five years. Different dynamics characterize four distinct phases of these interventions, determining the likelihood of conflict transformation. These dynamics display archetypal system behaviors representative of other persistent conflicts in Africa during the same time period. Field interviews combined with comparative statistics informed system models of conflict dynamics in Africa and Somalia. The models explored the relative impact of intervention feedback loops and key levers on potential for conflict transformation. It is shown that sustainable peace depends less on the appropriate sequencing of aid than on transparency, trust, and cooperation between various intervention actors and stakeholders to enable accountability at the local level. Technical innovations are needed to build transparency and trust between intervention stakeholders without increasing security risks. A potential solution is proposed that incorporates predictive analytics into peer -to -peer networks for monitoring interventions.

AB Designing blockchain architecture is still an open question and encounters a lot of challenges such as scalability, security, high utilization and so on. In this paper, we propose Chameleon, a scalable and adaptive permissioned blockchain architecture. We adopt the principles of non-forking, high security, scalable and high utilization to design the Chameleon to be suitable for next generation blockchain architecture. In Chameleon, we introduce credit value which can only he acquired through honest behavior to enhance the security of the consensus algorithm. We also introduce the QoS of transactions to meet the various needs of different users. While previous work using sharding to improve the scalability, they either store all transactions in every area or just work independently, it either causes too much redundant data or low resource utilization. Combined with the cloud storage, Chameleon partition the nodes into different area according to different scenario, every area process their own transactions and can also cooperate with each other dynamically to improve transaction throughput and resource utilization.

TI Blockchains and Smart Contracts for the Internet of Things
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts-scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.

AB The recent increase in reported incidents of surveillance and security breaches compromising users' privacy call into question the current model, in which third-parties collect and control massive amounts of personal data. Bitcoin has demonstrated in the financial space that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we describe a decentralized personal data management system that ensures users own and control their data. We implement a protocol that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require trust in a third party. Unlike Bitcoin, transactions in our system are not strictly financial -they are used to carry instructions, such as storing, querying and sharing data. Finally, we discuss possible future extensions to blockchains that could harness them into a well-rounded solution for trusted computing problems in society.

AB Emerging smart contract systems over decentralized cryptocurrencies allow mutually distrustful parties to transact safely without trusted third parties. In the event of contractual breaches or aborts, the decentralized blockchain ensures that honest parties obtain commensurate compensation. Existing systems, however, lack transactional privacy. All transactions, including flow of money between pseudonyms and amount transacted, are exposed on the blockchain.
   We present Hawk, a decentralized smart contract system that does not store financial transactions in the clear on the blockchain, thus retaining transactional privacy from the public's view. A Hawk programmer can write a private smart contract in an intuitive manner without having to implement cryptography, and our compiler automatically generates an efficient cryptographic protocol where contractual parties interact with the blockchain, using cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs.
   To formally define and reason about the security of our protocols, we are the first to formalize the blockchain model of cryptography. The formal modeling is of independent interest. We advocate the community to adopt such a formal model when designing applications atop decentralized blockchains.

In this survey, we unroll and structure the manyfold results and research directions. We start by introducing the Bitcoin protocol and its building blocks. From there we continue to explore the design space by discussing existing contributions and results. In the process, we deduce the fundamental structures and insights at the core of the Bitcoin protocol and its applications. As we show and discuss, many key ideas are likewise applicable in various other fields, so that their impact reaches far beyond Bitcoin itself.

TI Bitcoin: Economics, Technology, and Governance
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES
AB Bitcoin is an online communication protocol that facilitates the use of a virtual currency, including electronic payments. Bitcoin's rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators. Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power. Bitcoin's design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history. Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure-or even a requirement to provide a real name. Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment-though as we discuss, all these benefits face important limits. Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems. This article presents the platform's design principles and properties for a nontechnical audience; reviews its past, present, and future uses; and points out risks and regulatory issues as Bitcoin interacts with the conventional financial system and the real economy.

AB Bitcoin is the first digital currency to see widespread adoption. While payments are conducted between pseudonyms, Bitcoin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees: payment transactions are recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which much information can be deduced. Zerocoin (Miers et al., IEEE S&P 2013) tackles some of these privacy issues by unlinking transactions from the payment's origin. Yet, it still reveals payments' destinations and amounts, and is limited in functionality.
   In this paper, we construct a full-fledged ledger-based digital currency with strong privacy guarantees. Our results leverage recent advances in zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs).
   First, we formulate and construct decentralized anonymous payment schemes (DAP schemes). A DAP scheme enables users to directly pay each other privately: the corresponding transaction hides the payment's origin, destination, and transferred amount. We provide formal definitions and proofs of the construction's security.
   Second, we build Zerocash, a practical instantiation of our DAP scheme construction. In Zerocash, transactions are less than 1 kB and take under 6 ms to verify orders of magnitude more efficient than the less-anonymous Zerocoin and competitive with plain Bitcoin.

TI Where Is Current Research on Blockchain Technology?-A Systematic Review
SO PLOS ONE
AB Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology developed first for Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions, and therefore it creates interesting research areas, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations. In this research, we have conducted a systematic mapping study with the goal of collecting all relevant research on Blockchain technology. Our objective is to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding Blockchain technology from the technical perspective. We have extracted 41 primary papers from scientific databases. The results show that focus in over 80% of the papers is on Bitcoin system and less than 20% deals with other Blockchain applications including e.g. smart contracts and licensing. The majority of research is focusing on revealing and improving limitations of Blockchain from privacy and security perspectives, but many of the proposed solutions lack concrete evaluation on their effectiveness. Many other Blockchain scalability related challenges including throughput and latency have been left unstudied. On the basis of this study, recommendations on future research directions are provided for researchers.

AB Years of heavy regulation and bureaucratic inefficiency have slowed innovation for electronic medical records (EMRs). We now face a critical need for such innovation, as personalization and data science prompt patients to engage in the details of their healthcare and restore agency over their medical data. In this paper, we propose MedRec: a novel, decentralized record management system to handle EMRs, using blockchain technology. Our system gives patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across providers and treatment sites. Leveraging unique blockchain properties, MedRec manages authentication, confidentiality, accountability and data sharing-crucial considerations when handling sensitive information. A modular design integrates with providers' existing, local data storage solutions, facilitating interoperability and making our system convenient and adaptable. We incentivize medical stakeholders (researchers, public health authorities, etc.) to participate in the network as blockchain "miners". This provides them with access to aggregate, anonymized data as mining rewards, in return for sustaining and securing the network via Proof of Work. MedRec thus enables the emergence of data economics, supplying big data to empower researchers while engaging patients and providers in the choice to release metadata. The purpose of this short paper is to expose, prior to field tests, a working prototype through which we analyze and discuss our approach.

AB Bitcoin has received much attention in the media and by investors in recent years, although there remains scepticism and a lack of understanding of this cryptocurrency. We add to the literature on Bitcoin by studying the market efficiency of Bitcoin. Through a battery of robust tests, evidence reveals that returns are significantly inefficient over our full sample, but when we split our sample into two subsample periods, we find that some tests indicate that Bitcoin is efficient in the latter period. Therefore we conclude that Bitcoin in an inefficient market but may be in the process of moving towards an efficient market. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Bitcoin is the first e-cash system to see widespread adoption. While Bitcoin offers the potential for new types of financial interaction, it has significant limitations regarding privacy. Specifically, because the Bitcoin transaction log is completely public, users' privacy is protected only through the use of pseudonyms. In this paper we propose Zerocoin, a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin that augments the protocol to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions. Our system uses standard cryptographic assumptions and does not introduce new trusted parties or otherwise change the security model of Bitcoin. We detail Zerocoin's cryptographic construction, its integration into Bitcoin, and examine its performance both in terms of computation and impact on the Bitcoin protocol.

AB The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.
   We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners obtain a revenue larger than their fair share. This attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the selfish miners, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.
   Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any group size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by pools that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a group of any size can compromise the system.

AB Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the most damaging threats against Internet based applications. Many of the DDoS defense mechanisms may unintentionally deny a certain portion of legitimate user accesses by mistaking them as attackers or may simply not block enough traffic to adequately protect the victim. Other better performing systems have not yet to reach adoption because of designs that require a substantial investment into the Internet infrastructure before offering much effectiveness. This paper proposes Heimdall, a novel traffic verification based framework to protect legitimate traffic from bilateral damages. Based on a proof-of-work technique and application of distributed hash ID, aside from protecting established connections, our system can validate new initial request for communication and open valid channels between users and the protected server. Through intensive simulation experiments on the ns-2 network simulator, we verified that Heimdall scheme can effectively protect legitimate communications and filter out malicious flows with very high accuracy.

TI Healthcare Data Gateways: Found Healthcare Intelligence on Blockchain
   with Novel Privacy Risk Control
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Healthcare data are a valuable source of healthcare intelligence. Sharing of healthcare data is one essential step to make healthcare system smarter and improve the quality of healthcare service. Healthcare data, one personal asset of patient, should be owned and controlled by patient, instead of being scattered in different healthcare systems, which prevents data sharing and puts patient privacy at risks. Blockchain is demonstrated in the financial field that trusted, auditable computing is possible using a decentralized network of peers accompanied by a public ledger. In this paper, we proposed an App (called Healthcare Data Gateway (HGD)) architecture based on blockchain to enable patient to own, control and share their own data easily and securely without violating privacy, which provides a new potential way to improve the intelligence of healthcare systems while keeping patient data private. Our proposed purpose-centric access model ensures patient own and control their healthcare data; simple unified Indicator-Centric Schema (ICS) makes it possible to organize all kinds of personal healthcare data practically and easily. We also point out that MPC (Secure Multi-Party Computing) is one promising solution to enable untrusted third-party to conduct computation over patient data without violating privacy.

AB Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful crypto-graphic currency in history. Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bitcoin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions.
   We provide the first systematic exposition Bitcoin and the many related cryptocurrencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bitcoin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bitcoin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bitcoin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disintermediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disintermediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison.

AB Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and novel assumptions on the "hashing power" of the adversary relative to network synchronicity; we show our results to be tight under high synchronization.
   Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built "on top" of the backbone protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto's suggestion falls short of solving it, and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary's hashing power is bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin's operation as a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and that the adversary's hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed for security decreases as the network desynchronizes.

TI Designing microgrid energy markets A case study: The Brooklyn Microgrid
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Generation from distributed renewable energy sources is constantly increasing. Due to its volatility, the integration of this non-controllable generation poses severe challenges to the current energy system. Thus, ensuring a reliable balance of energy generation and consumption becomes increasingly demanding. In our approach to tackle these challenges, we suggest that consumers and prosumers can trade self produced energy in a peer-to-peer fashion on microgrid energy markets. Thus, consumers and prosumers can keep profits from energy trading within their community. This provides incentives for investments in renewable generation plants and for locally balancing supply and demand. Hence, both financial as well as socio-economic incentives for the integration and expansion of locally produced renewable energy are provided. The efficient operation of these microgrid energy markets requires innovative information systems for integrating the market participants in a user-friendly and comprehensive way. To this end, we present the concept of a blockchain-based microgrid energy market without the need for central intermediaries. We derive seven market components as a framework for building efficient microgrid energy markets. Then, we evaluate the Brooklyn Microgrid project as a case study of such a market according to the required components. We show that the Brooklyn Microgrid fully satisfies three and partially ful-fills an additional three of the seven components. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that block chains are an eligible technology to operate decentralized microgrid energy markets. However, current regulation does not allow to run local peer-to-peer energy markets in most countries and, hence, the seventh component cannot be satisfied yet. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI IoT security: Review, blockchain solutions, and open challenges
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB With the advent of smart homes, smart cities, and smart everything, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as an area of incredible impact, potential, and growth, with Cisco Inc. predicting to have 50 billion connected devices by 2020. However, most of these IoT devices are easy to hack and compromise. Typically, these IoT devices are limited in compute, storage, and network capacity, and therefore they are more vulnerable to attacks than other endpoint devices such as smartphones, tablets, or computers.
   In this paper, we present and survey major security issues for IoT. We review and categorize popular security issues with regard to the IoT layered architecture, in addition to protocols used for networking, communication, and management. We outline security requirements for IoT along with the existing attacks, threats, and state-of-the-art solutions. Furthermore, we tabulate and map IoT security problems against existing solutions found in the literature. More importantly, we discuss, how blockchain, which is the underlying technology for bitcoin, can be a key enabler to solve many IoT security problems. The paper also identifies open research problems and challenges for IoT security. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Digital currencies have emerged as a new fascinating phenomenon in the financial markets. Recent events on the most popular of the digital currencies - BitCoin - have risen crucial questions about behavior of its exchange rates and they offer a field to study dynamics of the market which consists practically only of speculative traders with no fundamentalists as there is no fundamental value to the currency. In the paper, we connect two phenomena of the latest years - digital currencies, namely BitCoin, and search queries on Google Trends and Wikipedia - and study their relationship. We show that not only are the search queries and the prices connected but there also exists a pronounced asymmetry between the effect of an increased interest in the currency while being above or below its trend value.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING
AB Smart grids equipped with bi-directional communication flow are expected to provide more sophisticated consumption monitoring and energy trading. However, the issues related to the security and privacy of consumption and trading data present serious challenges. In this paper we address the problem of providing transaction security in decentralized smart grid energy trading without reliance on trusted third parties. We have implemented a proof-of-concept for decentralized energy trading system using blockchain technology, multi-signatures, and anonymous encrypted messaging streams, enabling peers to anonymously negotiate energy prices and securely perform trading transactions. We conducted case studies to perform security analysis and performance evaluation within the context of the elicited security and privacy requirements.

TI Enabling Localized Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading Among Plug-in Hybrid
   Electric Vehicles Using Consortium Blockchains
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB We propose a localized peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity trading model for locally buying and selling electricity among plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in smart grids. Unlike traditional schemes, which transport electricity over long distances and through complex electricity transportation meshes, our proposed model achieves demand response by providing incentives to discharging PHEVs to balance local electricity demand out of their own self-interests. However, since transaction security and privacy protection issues present serious challenges, we explore a promising consortium blockchain technology to improve transaction security without reliance on a trusted third party. A localized P2P Electricity Trading system with COnsortium blockchaiN (PETCON) method is proposed to illustrate detailed operations of localized P2P electricity trading. Moreover, the electricity pricing and the amount of traded electricity among PHEVs are solved by an iterative double auction mechanism to maximize social welfare in this electricity trading. Security analysis shows that our proposed PETCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Numerical results based on a real map of Texas indicate that the double auction mechanism can achieve social welfare maximization while protecting privacy of the PHEVs.

AB Cryptocurrencies, based on and led by Bitcoin, have shown promise as infrastructure for pseudonymous online payments, cheap remittance, trustless digital asset exchange, and smart contracts. However, Bitcoin-derived blockchain protocols have inherent scalability limits that trade off between throughput and latency, which withhold the realization of this potential.
   This paper presents Bitcoin-NG (Next Generation), a new blockchain protocol designed to scale. Bitcoin-NG is a Byzantine fault tolerant blockchain protocol that is robust to extreme churn and shares the same trust model as Bitcoin.
   In addition to Bitcoin-NG, we introduce several novel metrics of interest in quantifying the security and efficiency of Bitcoin-like blockchain protocols. We implement Bitcoin-NG and perform large-scale experiments at 15% the size of the operational Bitcoin system, using unchanged clients of both protocols. These experiments demonstrate that Bitcoin-NG scales optimally, with bandwidth limited only by the capacity of the individual nodes and latency limited only by the propagation time of the network.

AB Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the feature to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins.
   In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new security problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain pro fit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make contracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called OYENTE to find potential security bugs. Among 19; 366 existing Ethereum contracts, OYENTE flags 8; 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.

TI Doxorubicin-loaded amphiphilic polypeptide-based nanoparticles as an
   efficient drug delivery system for cancer therapy
SO ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
AB An amphiphilic anionic copolymer, methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(L-glutamic acid-co-L-phenylalanine) (mPEG-b-P(Glu-co-Phe)), with three functionalized domains, was synthesized and used as a nanovehicle for cationic anticancer drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX-HCl) delivery via electrostatic interactions for cancer treatment. The three domains displayed distinct functions: PEG block chain for prolonged circulation; poly(phenylalanine) domain for stabilizing the nanoparticle construct through hydrophobic/aromatic interactions; and the poly(glutamic acid) domain for providing electrostatic interactions with the cationic drug to be loaded. The copolymer could self-assemble into micellar-type nanoparticles, and DOX was successfully loaded into the interior of nanoparticles by simple mixing of DOX-HCl and the copolymer in the aqueous phase. DOX-loaded mPEG-b-P(Glu-co-Phe) nanoparticles (DOX-NP) had a superior drug-loading content (DLC) (21.7%), a high loading efficiency (almost 98%) and a pH-triggered release of DOX. The size of DOX-NP was similar to 140 nm, as determined by dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy. In vitro assays showed that DOX-NP exhibited higher cell proliferation inhibition and higher cell uptake in A549 cell lines compared with free DOX-HCl. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) studies showed that DOX-NP demonstrated an excellent safety profile with a significantly higher MTD (15 mg DOX kg(-1)) than that of free DOX.HCl (5 mg DOX kg(-1)). The in vivo studies on the subcutaneous non-small cell lung cancer (A549) xenograft nude mice model confirmed that DOX-NP showed significant antitumor activity and reduced side effects, and then enhanced tumor accumulation as a result of the prolonged circulation in blood and the enhanced permeation and retention effect, compared with free DOX, indicating its great potential for cancer therapy.

AB Rapid advances in industrialisation and informatisation methods have spurred tremendous progress in developing the next generation of manufacturing technology. Today, we are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In 2013, amongst one of 10 Future Projects' identified by the German government as part of its High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, the Industry 4.0 project is considered to be a major endeavour for Germany to establish itself as a leader of integrated industry. In 2014, China's State Council unveiled their ten-year national plan, Made-in-China 2025, which was designed to transform China from the world's workshop into a world manufacturing power. Made-in-China 2025 is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade China's industry including the manufacturing sector. In Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025, many applications require a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of Industry 4.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines including cyber-physical Systems, IoT, cloud computing, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Architecture, SOA, Business Process Management, Industrial Information Integration and others. At this present moment, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major obstacle for exploiting the full potential of Industry 4.0. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for realising Industry 4.0, which poses unique challenges. In this paper, we briefly survey the state of the art in the area of Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.

The conceptual framework is based on the Barro (1979) model, from which we derive testable hypotheses. Using daily data for five years (2009-2015) and applying time-series analytical mechanisms, we find that market forces and BitCoin attractiveness for investors and users have a significant impact on BitCoin price but with variation over time. Our estimates do not support previous findings that macro-financial developments are driving BitCoin price in the long run.

TI The economics of Bitcoin and similar private digital currencies
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY
AB Recent innovations have made it feasible to transfer private digital currency without the intervention of an organization such as a bank. Any currency must prevent users from spending their balances more than once, which is easier said than done with purely digital currencies. Current digital currencies such as Bitcoin use peer-to-peer networks and open source software to stop double spending and create finality of transactions. This paper explains how the use of these technologies and limitation of the quantity produced can create an equilibrium in which a digital currency has a positive value. This paper also summarizes the rise of 2417 trading on computerized markets in Bitcoin in which there are no brokers or other agents. The average monthly volatility of returns on Bitcoin is higher than for gold or a set of foreign currencies in dollars, but the lowest monthly volatilities for Bitcoin are less than the highest monthly volatilities for gold and the foreign currencies.

We analyze how fundamental and circumstantial bottlenecks in Bitcoin limit the ability of its current peer-to-peer overlay network to support substantially higher throughputs and lower latencies. Our results suggest that reparameterization of block size and intervals should be viewed only as a first increment toward achieving next-generation, high-load blockchain protocols, and major advances will additionally require a basic rethinking of technical approaches. We offer a structured perspective on the design space for such approaches. Within this perspective, we enumerate and briefly discuss a number of recently proposed protocol ideas and offer several new ideas and open challenges.

TI Routine Outcome Monitoring in the Netherlands: Practical Experiences
   with a Web-Based Strategy for the Assessment of Treatment Outcome in
   Clinical Practice
SO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB Routine outcome monitoring (ROM) is a method devised to systematically collect data on the effectiveness of treatments in everyday clinical practice. ROM involves documenting the outcome of treatments through repeated assessments. Assistants are employed who perfonn a baseline assessment comprising a standardized diagnostic interview, administration of rating scales and completion of several self-report measures by the patient. At fixed time intervals, assessments are repeated. Dedicated Web-based software has been developed to assist in this task. ROM informs therapists and patients on the severity of the complaints at intake, and the waxing and waning of symptoms over the course of treatment. Researchers can use ROM for effectiveness research, and managers can use it for benchmarking. The use of ROM for research is illustrated by presenting data on the diagnostic status of patients participating in ROM and data on treatment outcome of a subgroup of patients (with panic disorder) in our database. The results show that implementation of ROM is feasible, and after some initial reservations, most therapists now consider ROM to be a necessary and important adjunct to the clinical treatment. In addition, ROM furthers research as the data can be used to study the phenomenology of psychiatric disorders and the outcome of treatments delivered in everyday practice.

AB Smart contracts are computer programs that can be correctly executed by a network of mutually distrusting nodes, without the need of an external trusted authority. Since smart contracts handle and transfer assets of considerable value, besides their correct execution it is also crucial that their implementation is secure against attacks which aim at stealing or tampering the assets. We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far. We analyse the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts, providing a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls which may lead to vulnerabilities. We show a series of attacks which exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an adversary to steal money or cause other damage.

AB Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain.

SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This letter revisits the informational efficiency of the Bitcoin market. In particular we analyze the time-varying behavior of long memory of returns on Bitcoin and volatility 2011 until 2017, using the Hurst exponent. Our results are twofold. First, R/S method is prone to detect long memory, whereas DFA method can discriminate more precisely variations in informational efficiency across time. Second, daily returns exhibit persistent behavior in the first half of the period under study, whereas its behavior is more informational efficient since 2014. Finally, price volatility, measured as the logarithmic difference between intraday high and low prices exhibits long memory during all the period. This reflects a different underlying dynamic process generating the prices and volatility. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For enthusiasts, Bitcoin provides an alternative to currencies and payment systems that are seen to threaten users' privacy, limit personal liberty, and undermine the value of money through state and corporate oversight. Bitcoin's promise lies in its apparent capacity to resolve these concerns not through regulatory institutions or interpersonal trust, but through its cryptographic protocols. We characterize this semiotics as a "practical materialism" and suggest it replays debates about privacy, labor, and value.

TI MeDShare: Trust-Less Medical Data Sharing Among Cloud Service Providers
   via Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The dissemination of patients' medical records results in diverse risks to patients' privacy as malicious activities on these records cause severe damage to the reputation, finances, and so on of all parties related directly or indirectly to the data. Current methods to effectively manage and protect medical records have been proved to be insufficient. In this paper, we propose MeDShare, a system that addresses the issue of medical data sharing among medical big data custodians in a trust-less environment. The system is blockchain-based and provides data provenance, auditing, and control for shared medical data in cloud repositories among big data entities. MeDShare monitors entities that access data for malicious use from a data custodian system. In MeDShare, data transitions and sharing from one entity to the other, along with all actions performed on the MeDShare system, are recorded in a tamper-proof manner. The design employs smart contracts and an access control mechanism to effectively track the behavior of the data and revoke access to offending entities on detection of violation of permissions on data. The performance of MeDShare is comparable to current cutting edge solutions to data sharing among cloud service providers. By implementing MeDShare, cloud service providers and other data guardians will be able to achieve data provenance and auditing while sharing medical data with entities such as research and medical institutions with minimal risk to data privacy.

AB Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and 250 similar alt-coins, embody at their core a blockchain protocol - a mechanism for a distributed network of computational nodes to periodically agree on a set of new transactions. Designing a secure blockchain protocol relies on an open challenge in security, that of designing a highly-scalable agreement protocol open to manipulation by byzantine or arbitrarily malicious nodes. Bitcoin's blockchain agreement protocol exhibits security, but does not scale: it processes 3-7 transactions per second at present, irrespective of the available computation capacity at hand.
   In this paper, we propose a new distributed agreement protocol for permission-less blockchains called ELASTICO. ELASTICO scales transaction rates almost linearly with available computation for mining: the more the computation power in the network, the higher the number of transaction blocks selected per unit time. ELASTICO is efficient in its network messages and tolerates byzantine adversaries of up to one-fourth of the total computational power. Technically, ELASTICO uniformly partitions or parallelizes the mining network (securely) into smaller committees, each of which processes a disjoint set of transactions (or "shards"). While sharding is common in non-byzantine settings, ELASTICO is the first candidate for a secure sharding protocol with presence of byzantine adversaries. Our scalability experiments on Amazon EC2 with up to 1,600 nodes confirm ELASTICO's theoretical scaling properties.

Given its novelty, this paper investigates some statistical properties of the Bitcoin market. This study compares Bitcoin and standard currencies dynamics and focuses on the analysis of returns at different time scales. We test the presence of long memory in return time series from 2011 to 2017, using transaction data from one Bitcoin platform. We compute the Hurst exponent by means of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis method, using a sliding window in order to measure long range dependence. We detect that Hurst exponents changes significantly during the first years of existence of Bitcoin, tending to stabilize in recent times. Additionally, multiscale analysis shows a similar behavior of the Hurst exponent, implying a self-similar process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One of the technical challenges of having billions of devices deployed worldwide is the ability to manage them. Although access management technologies exist in IoT, they are based on centralized models which introduce a new variety of technical limitations to manage them globally. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for arbitrating roles and permissions in IoT. The new architecture is a fully distributed access control system for IoT based on blockchain technology. The architecture is backed by a proof of concept implementation and evaluated in realistic IoT scenarios. The results show that the blockchain technology could be used as access management technology in specific scalable IoT scenarios.

AB In industrial Internet of things (IIoT), peerto-peer (P2P) energy trading ubiquitously takes place in various scenarios, e.g., microgrids, energy harvesting networks, and vehicle-to-grid networks. However, there are common security and privacy challenges caused by untrusted and nontransparent energy markets in these scenarios. To address the security challenges, we exploit the consortium blockchain technology to propose a secure energy trading system named energy blockchain. This energy blockchain can be widely used in general scenarios of P2P energy trading getting rid of a trusted intermediary. Besides, to reduce the transaction limitation resulted from transaction confirmation delays on the energy blockchain, we propose a credit-based payment scheme to support fast and frequent energy trading. An optimal pricing strategy using Stackelberg game for credit-based loans is also proposed. Security analysis and numerical results based on a real dataset illustrate that the proposed energy blockchain and credit-based payment scheme are secure and efficient in IIoT.

TI The digital traces of bubbles: feedback cycles between socio-economic
   signals in the Bitcoin economy
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
AB What is the role of social interactions in the creation of price bubbles? Answering this question requires obtaining collective behavioural traces generated by the activity of a large number of actors. Digital currencies offer a unique possibility to measure socio-economic signals from such digital traces. Here, we focus on Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has experienced periods of rapid increase in exchange rates (price) followed by sharp decline; we hypothesize that these fluctuations are largely driven by the interplay between different social phenomena. We thus quantify four socio-economic signals about Bitcoin from large datasets: price on online exchanges, volume of word-of-mouth communication in online social media, volume of information search and user base growth. By using vector autoregression, we identify two positive feedback loops that lead to price bubbles in the absence of exogenous stimuli: one driven by word of mouth, and the other by new Bitcoin adopters. We also observe that spikes in information search, presumably linked to external events, precede drastic price declines. Understanding the interplay between the socio-economic signals we measured can lead to applications beyond cryptocurrencies to other phenomena that leave digital footprints, such as online social network usage.

CY APR 23-26, 2018
CL Porto, PORTUGAL
AB Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).
   Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.
   This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.

TI Can volume predict Bitcoin returns and volatility? A quantiles-based
   approach
SO ECONOMIC MODELLING
AB Prior studies on the price formation in the Bitcoin market consider the role of Bitcoin transactions at the conditional mean of the returns distribution. This study employs in contrast a non-parametric causality-inquantiles test to analyse the causal relation between trading volume and Bitcoin returns and volatility, over the whole of their respective conditional distributions. The nonparametric characteristics of our test control for misspecification due to nonlinearity and structural breaks, two features of our data that cover 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. The causality-in-quantiles test reveals that volume can predict returns - except in Bitcoin bear and bull market regimes. This result highlights the importance of modelling nonlinearity and accounting for the tail behaviour when analysing causal relationships between Bitcoin returns and trading volume. We show, however, that volume cannot help predict the volatility of Bitcoin returns at any point of the conditional distribution.

TI Responsible vendors, intelligent consumers: Silk Road, the online
   revolution in drug trading
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
AB Background: Silk Road is located on the Deep Web and provides an anonymous transacting infrastructure for the retail of drugs and pharmaceuticals. Members are attracted to the site due to protection of identity by screen pseudonyms, variety and quality of product listings, selection of vendors based on reviews, reduced personal risks, stealth of product delivery, development of personal connections with vendors in stealth modes and forum activity. The study aimed to explore vendor accounts of Silk Road as retail infrastructure.
   Methods: A single and holistic case study with embedded units approach (Yin, 2003) was chosen to explore the accounts of vendor subunits situated within the Silk Road marketplace. Vendors (n =10) completed an online interview via the direct message facility and via Tor mail.
   Results: Vendors described themselves as 'intelligent and responsible' consumers of drugs. Decisions to commence vending operations on the site centred on simplicity in setting up vendor accounts, and opportunity to operate within a low risk, high traffic, high mark-up, secure and anonymous Deep Web infrastructure. The embedded online culture of harm reduction ethos appealed to them in terms of the responsible vending and use of personally tested high quality products. The professional approach to running their Silk Road businesses and dedication to providing a quality service was characterised by professional advertising of quality products, professional communication and visibility on forum pages, speedy dispatch of slightly overweight products, competitive pricing, good stealth techniques and efforts to avoid customer disputes. Vendors appeared content with a fairly constant buyer demand and described a relatively competitive market between small and big time market players. Concerns were evident with regard to Bitcoin instability.
   Conclusion: The greatest threat to Silk Road and other sites operating on the Deep Web is not law enforcement or market dynamics, it is technology itself. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Software Defined Fog Node Based Distributed Blockchain Cloud
   Architecture for IoT
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The recent expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the consequent explosion in the volume of data produced by smart devices have led to the outsourcing of data to designated data centers. However, to manage these huge data stores, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage cannot afford auspicious way. There are many challenges that must be addressed in the traditional network architecture due to the rapid growth in the diversity and number of devices connected to the internet, which is not designed to provide high availability, real-time data delivery, scalability, security, resilience, and low latency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based distributed cloud architecture with a software defined networking (SDN) enable controller fog nodes at the edge of the network to meet the required design principles. The proposed model is a distributed cloud architecture based on blockchain technology, which provides low-cost, secure, and on-demand access to the most competitive computing infrastructures in an IoT network. By creating a distributed cloud infrastructure, the proposed model enables cost-effective high-performance computing. Furthermore, to bring computing resources to the edge of the IoT network and allow low latency access to large amounts of data in a secure manner, we provide a secure distributed fog node architecture that uses SDN and blockchain techniques. Fog nodes are distributed fog computing entities that allow the deployment of fog services, and are formed by multiple computing resources at the edge of the IoT network. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with the existing models using various performance measures. The results of our evaluation show that performance is improved by reducing the induced delay, reducing the response time, increasing throughput, and the ability to detect real-time attacks in the IoT network with low performance overheads.

TI BlockChain: A Distributed Solution to Automotive Security and Privacy
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Interconnected smart vehicles offer a range of sophisticated services that benefit the vehicle owners, transport authorities, car manufacturers, and other service providers. This potentially exposes smart vehicles to a range of security and privacy threats such as location tracking or remote hijacking of the vehicle. In this article, we argue that blockchain (BC), a disruptive technology that has found many applications from cryptocurrencies to smart contracts, is a potential solution to these challenges. We propose a BC-based architecture to protect the privacy of users and to increase the security of the vehicular ecosystem. Wireless remote software updates and other emerging services such as dynamic vehicle insurance fees are used to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed security architecture. We also qualitatively argue the resilience of the architecture against common security attacks.

We establish security properties for the protocol comparable to those achieved by the bitcoin blockchain protocol. As the protocol provides a "proof of stake" blockchain discipline, it offers qualitative efficiency advantages over blockchains based on proof of physical resources (e.g., proof of work). We also present a novel reward mechanism for incentivizing Proof of Stake protocols and we prove that, given this mechanism, honest behavior is an approximate Nash equilibrium, thus neutralizing attacks such as selfish mining.

AB Blockchains like Bitcoin and Namecoin and their respective P2P networks have seen significant adoption in the past few years and show promise as naming systems with no trusted parties. Users can register human meaningful names and securely associate data with them, and only the owner of the particular private keys that registered them can write or update the name-value pair. In theory, many decentralized systems can be built using these blockchain networks, such as new, decentralized versions of DNS and PKI. As the technology is relatively new and evolving rapidly, however, little production data or experience is available to guide design tradeoffs.
   In this paper, we describe our experiences operating a large deployment of a decentralized PKI service built on top of the Namecoin blockchain. We present various challenges pertaining to network reliability, throughput, and security that we needed to overcome while registering and updating over 33,000 entries and 200,000 transactions on the Namecoin blockchain. Further, we discuss how our experience informed the design of a new blockchain-based naming and storage system called Blockstack. We detail why we switched from the Namecoin network to the Bitcoin network for the new system, and present operational lessons from this migration. Blockstack is released as open source software and currently powers a production PKI system for 55,000 users.

AB Blockchain has numerous benefits such as decentralisation, persistency, anonymity and auditability. There is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications ranging from cryptocurrency, financial services, risk management, internet of things (IoT) to public and social services. Although a number of studies focus on using the blockchain technology in various application aspects, there is no comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology in both technological and application perspectives. To fill this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology. In particular, this paper gives the blockchain taxonomy, introduces typical blockchain consensus algorithms, reviews blockchain applications and discusses technical challenges as well as recent advances in tackling the challenges. Moreover, this paper also points out the future directions in the blockchain technology.

AB Blockchain, widely known as one of the disruptive technologies emerged in recent years, is experiencing rapid development and has the full potential of revolutionizing the increasingly centralized intelligent transportation systems (ITS) in applications. Blockchain can be utilized to establish a secured, trusted and decentralized autonomous ITS ecosystem, creating better usage of the legacy ITS infrastructure and resources, especially effective for crowdsourcing technology. This paper conducts a preliminary study of Blockchain-based ITS ((BITS)-I-2). We outline an ITS-oriented, seven-layer conceptual model for blockchain, and on this basis address the key research issues in (BITS)-I-2. We consider that blockchain is one of the secured and trusted architectures for building the newly developed parallel transportation management systems (PtMS), and thereby discuss the relationship between (BITS)-I-2 and PtMS. Finally, we present a case study for blockchain-based realtime ride-sharing services. In our viewpoint, (BITS)-I-2 represents the future trend of ITS research and practice, and this paper is aimed at stimulating further effort and providing helpful guidance and reference for future research works.

AB The increasing amount of renewable energy sources in the energy system calls for new market approaches to price and distribute the volatile and decentralized generation. Local energy markets, on which consumers and prosumers can trade locally produced renewable generation directly within their community, balance generation and consumption locally in a decentralized approach. We present a comprehensive concept, market design and simulation of a local energy market between 100 residential households. Our approach is based on a distributed information and communication technology, i.e. a private blockchain, which underlines the decentralized nature of local energy markets. Thus, we provide energy prosumers and consumers with a decentralized market platform for trading local energy generation without the need of a central intermediary. Furthermore, we present a preliminary economic evaluation of the market mechanism and a research agenda for the technological evaluation of blockchain technology as the local energy market's main information and communication technology.

AB This paper explores how the Internet of Things and blockchain technology can benefit shared economy applications. The focus of this research is understanding how blockchain can be exploited to create decentralised, shared economy applications that allow people to monetise, securely, their things to create more wealth. Shared economy applications such as Airbnb and Uber are wellknown applications, but there are many other opportunities to share in the digital economy. With the recent interest in the Internet of Things and blockchain, the opportunity exists to create a myriad of sharing applications, e.g. peer-to-peer automatic payment mechanisms, foreign exchange platforms, digital rights management and cultural heritage to name but a few. While many types of shared economy scenarios are proliferating, few of them, so far, leverage the Intemet of Things and blockchain as technologies to build distributed applications. This paper discusses how we might make use of the Internet of Things and blockchains to create secure shared economy distributed applications. Presented are examples of such distributed applications in the context of an Internet of Things architecture using blockchain technology.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, introduced in 2008, that has recently gained noticeable popularity. Its main features are: (a) it lacks a central authority that controls the transactions, (b) the list of transactions is publicly available, and (c) its syntax allows more advanced transactions than simply transferring the money. The goal of this paper is to show how these properties of Bitcoin can be used in the area of secure multiparty computation protocols (MPCs).
   Firstly, we show that the Bitcoin system provides an attractive way to construct a version of "timed commitments", where the committer has to reveal his secret within a certain time frame, or to pay a fine. This, in turn, can be used to obtain fairness in some multiparty protocols. Secondly, we introduce a concept of multiparty protocols that work "directly on Bitcoin". Recall that the standard definition of the MPCs guarantees only that the protocol "emulates the trusted third party". Hence ensuring that the inputs are correct, and the outcome is respected is beyond the scope of the definition. Our observation is that the Bitcoin system can be used to go beyond the standard "emulation-based" definition, by constructing protocols that link their inputs and the outputs with the real Bitcoin transactions.
   As an instantiation of this idea we construct protocols for secure multiparty lotteries using the Bitcoin currency, without relying on a trusted authority (one of these protocols uses the Bitcoin-based timed commitments mentioned above). Our protocols guarantee fairness for the honest parties no matter how the loser behaves. For example: if one party interrupts the protocol then her money is transferred to the honest participants. Our protocols are practical (to demonstrate it we performed their transactions in the actual Bitcoin system), and can be used in real life as a replacement for the online gambling sites. We think that this paradigm can have also other applications. We discuss some of them.

AB An open distributed system can be secured by requiring participants to present proof of work and rewarding them for participation. The Bitcoin digital currency introduced this mechanism, which is adopted by almost all contemporary digital currencies and related services.
   A natural process leads participants of such systems to form pools, where members aggregate their power and share the rewards. Experience with Bitcoin shows that the largest pools are often open, allowing anyone to join. It has long been known that a member can sabotage an open pool by seemingly joining it but never sharing its proofs of work. The pool shares its revenue with the attacker, and so each of its participants earns less.
   We define and analyze a game where pools use some of their participants to infiltrate other pools and perform such an attack. With any number of pools, no-pool-attacks is not a Nash equilibrium. We study the special cases where either two pools or any number of identical pools play the game and the rest of the participants are uninvolved. In both of these cases there exists an equilibrium that constitutes a tragedy of the commons where the participating pools attack one another and earn less than they would have if none had attacked.
   For two pools, the decision whether or not to attack is the miner's dilemma, an instance of the iterative prisoner's dilemma. The game is played daily by the active Bitcoin pools, which apparently choose not to attack. If this balance breaks, the revenue of open pools might diminish, making them unattractive to participants.

AB Bitcoin is a disruptive new crypto-currency based on a decentralized open-source protocol which has been gradually gaining momentum. Perhaps the most important question that will affect Bitcoin's success, is whether or not it will be able to scale to support the high volume of transactions required from a global currency system. We investigate the implications of having a higher transaction throughput on Bitcoin's security against double-spend attacks. We show that at high throughput, substantially weaker attackers are able to reverse payments they have made, even well after they were considered accepted by recipients. We address this security concern through the GHOST rule, a modification to the way Bitcoin nodes construct and re-organize the block chain, Bitcoin's core distributed data-structure. GHOST has been adopted and a variant of it has been implemented as part of the Ethereum project, a second generation distributed applications platform.

TI An ID-Based Linearly Homomorphic Signature Scheme and Its Application in
   Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Identity-based cryptosystems mean that public keys can be directly derived from user identifiers, such as telephone numbers, email addresses, and social insurance number, and so on. So they can simplify key management procedures of certificate-based public key infrastructures and can be used to realize authentication in blockchain. Linearly homomorphic signature schemes allow to perform linear computations on authenticated data. And the correctness of the computation can be publicly verified. Although a series of homomorphic signature schemes have been designed recently, there are few homomorphic signature schemes designed in identity-based cryptography. In this paper, we construct a new ID-based linear homomorphic signature scheme, which avoids the shortcomings of the use of public-key certificates. The scheme is proved secure against existential forgery on adaptively chosen message and ID attack under the random oracle model. The ID-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes can be applied in e-business and cloud computing. Finally, we show how to apply it to realize authentication in blockchain.

TI An Item Response Theory Integration of Normal and Abnormal Personality
   Scales
SO PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) currently conceptualizes personality disorders (PDs) as categorical syndromes that are distinct from normal personality. However, an alternative dimensional viewpoint is that PDs are maladaptive expressions of general personality traits. The dimensional perspective postulates that personality pathology exists at a more extreme level of the latent trait than does general personality. This hypothesis was examined using item response theory analyses comparing scales from two personality pathology instruments the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, in press) and the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP; Clark, 1993; Clark, Simms, Wu, & Casillas, in press) with scales from an instrument designed to assess normal range personality, the NEO Personality Inventory Revised (NEO PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992). The results indicate that respective scales from these instruments assess shared latent constructs, with the NEO PI-R providing more information at the lower (normal) range and the DAPP-BQ and SNAP providing more information at the higher (abnormal) range. Nevertheless, the results also demonstrated substantial overlap in coverage. Implications of the findings are discussed with respect to the study and development of items that would provide specific discriminations along underlying trait continua.

TI Blockchain-Based Dynamic Key Management for Heterogeneous Intelligent
   Transportation Systems
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB As modern vehicle and communication technologies advanced apace, people begin to believe that the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) would be achievable in one decade. ITS introduces information technology to the transportation infrastructures and aims to improve road safety and traffic efficiency. However, security is still a main concern in vehicular communication systems (VCSs). This can be addressed through secured group broadcast. Therefore, secure key management schemes are considered as a critical technique for network security. In this paper, we propose a framework for providing secure key management within the heterogeneous network. The security managers (SMs) play a key role in the framework by capturing the vehicle departure information, encapsulating block to transport keys and then executing rekeying to vehicles within the same security domain. The first part of this framework is a novel network topology based on a decentralized blockchain structure. The blockchain concept is proposed to simplify the distributed key management in heterogeneous VCS domains. The second part of the framework uses the dynamic transaction collection period to further reduce the key transfer time during vehicles handover. Extensive simulations and analysis show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework, in which the blockchain structure performs better in term of key transfer time than the structure with a central manager, while the dynamic scheme allows SMs to flexibly fit various traffic levels.

TI DistBlockNet: A Distributed Blockchains-Based Secure SDN Architecture
   for IoT Networks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB The rapid increase in the number and diversity of smart devices connected to the Internet has raised the issues of flexibility, efficiency, availability, security, and scalability within the current IoT network. These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.

AB Cloud data provenance is metadata that records the history of the creation and operations performed on a cloud data object. Secure data provenance is crucial for data accountability, forensics and privacy. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and trusted cloud data provenance architecture using blockchain technology. Blockchain-based data provenance can provide tamper-proof records, enable the transparency of data accountability in the cloud, and help to enhance the privacy and availability of the provenance data. We make use of the cloud storage scenario and choose the cloud file as a data unit to detect user operations for collecting provenance data. We design and implement ProvChain, an architecture to collect and verify cloud data provenance, by embedding the provenance data into blockchain transactions. ProvChain operates mainly in three phases: (1) provenance data collection, (2) provenance data storage, and (3) provenance data validation. Results from performance evaluation demonstrate that ProvChain provides security features including tamper-proof provenance, user privacy and reliability with low overhead for the cloud storage applications.

TI Virtual currency, tangible return: Portfolio diversification with
   bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF ASSET MANAGEMENT
AB Bitcoin (BTC) is a major virtual currency. Using weekly data over the 2010-2013 period, we analyze a BTC investment from the standpoint of a US investor with a diversified portfolio including both traditional assets (worldwide stocks, bonds, hard currencies) and alternative investments (commodities, hedge funds, real estate). Over the period under consideration, BTC investment had highly distinctive features, including exceptionally high average return and volatility. Its correlation with other assets was remarkably low. Spanning tests confirm that BTC investment offers significant diversification benefits. We show that the inclusion of even a small proportion of BTCs may dramatically improve the risk-return trade-off of well-diversified portfolios. Results should however be taken with caution as the data may reflect early-stage behavior that may not last in the medium or long run.

TI Bitcoin: Medium of exchange or speculative assets?
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS & MONEY
AB Bitcoin is defined as digital money within a decentralized peer-to-peer payment network. It is a hybrid between fiat currency and commodity currency without intrinsic value and independent of any government or monetary authority. This paper analyses the question of whether Bitcoin is a medium of exchange or an asset and more specifically, what is its current usage and what usage will prevail in the future given its characteristics. We analyse the statistical properties of Bitcoin and find that it is uncorrelated with traditional asset classes such as stocks, bonds and commodities both in normal times and in periods of financial turmoil. The analysis of transaction data of Bitcoin accounts shows that Bitcoins are mainly used as a speculative investment and not as an alternative currency and medium of exchange. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Do the Rich Get Richer? An Empirical Analysis of the Bitcoin Transaction
   Network
SO PLOS ONE
AB The possibility to analyze everyday monetary transactions is limited by the scarcity of available data, as this kind of information is usually considered highly sensitive. Present econophysics models are usually employed on presumed random networks of interacting agents, and only some macroscopic properties (e.g. the resulting wealth distribution) are compared to real-world data. In this paper, we analyze Bitcoin, which is a novel digital currency system, where the complete list of transactions is publicly available. Using this dataset, we reconstruct the network of transactions and extract the time and amount of each payment. We analyze the structure of the transaction network by measuring network characteristics over time, such as the degree distribution, degree correlations and clustering. We find that linear preferential attachment drives the growth of the network. We also study the dynamics taking place on the transaction network, i.e. the flow of money. We measure temporal patterns and the wealth accumulation. Investigating the microscopic statistics of money movement, we find that sublinear preferential attachment governs the evolution of the wealth distribution. We report a scaling law between the degree and wealth associated to individual nodes.

AB We study a model of fairness in secure computation in which an adversarial party that aborts on receiving output is forced to pay a mutually predefined monetary penalty. We then show how the Bitcoin network can be used to achieve the above notion of fairness in the twoparty as well as the multiparty setting (with a dishonest majority). In particular, we propose new ideal functionalities and protocols for fair secure computation and fair lottery in this model.
   One of our main contributions is the definition of an ideal primitive, which we call F-CR(star) (CR stands for "claim-or-refund"), that formalizes and abstracts the exact properties we require from the Bitcoin network to achieve our goals. Naturally, this abstraction allows us to design fair protocols in a hybrid model in which parties have access to the F-CR(star) functionality, and is otherwise independent of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We also show an efficient realization of F-CR(star) that requires only two Bitcoin transactions to be made on the network.
   Our constructions also enjoy high efficiency. In a multiparty setting, our protocols only require a constant number of calls to F-CR(star) per party on top of a standard multiparty secure computation protocol. Our fair multiparty lottery protocol improves over previous solutions which required a quadratic number of Bitcoin transactions.

TI Apple Peel Polyphenols and Their Beneficial Actions on Oxidative Stress
   and Inflammation
SO PLOS ONE
AB Since gastrointestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to reactive oxygen species from various sources, the presence of antioxidants may contribute to the body's natural defenses against inflammatory diseases.
   Hypothesis: To define the polyphenols extracted from dried apple peels (DAPP) and determine their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential in the intestine. Caco-2/15 cells were used to study the role of DAPP preventive actions against oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation induced by iron-ascorbate (Fe/Asc) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively.
   Results: The combination of HPLC with fluorescence detection, HPLC-ESI-MS TOF and UPLC-ESI-MS/MS QQQ allowed us to characterize the phenolic compounds present in the DAPP (phenolic acids, flavonol glycosides, flavan-3-ols, procyanidins). The addition of Fe/Asc to Caco-2/15 cells induced OxS as demonstrated by the rise in malondialdehyde, depletion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and alterations in the activity of endogenous antioxidants (SOD, GPx, G-Red). However, preincubation with DAPP prevented Fe/Asc-mediated lipid peroxidation and counteracted LPS-mediated inflammation as evidenced by the down-regulation of cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), and prostaglandin E2. The mechanisms of action triggered by DAPP induced also a down-regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor-kappa B, respectively. These actions were accompanied by the induction of Nrf2 (orchestrating cellular antioxidant defenses and maintaining redox homeostasis), and PGC-1 alpha (the "master controller" of mitochondrial biogenesis).
   Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence of the capacity of DAPP to reduce OxS and inflammation, two pivotal processes involved in inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI On blockchain and its integration with loT. Challenges and opportunities
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) vision, conventional devices become smart and autonomous. This vision is turning into a reality thanks to advances in technology, but there are still challenges to address, particularly in the security domain e.g., data reliability. Taking into account the predicted evolution of the loT in the coming years, it is necessary to provide confidence in this huge incoming information source. Blockchain has emerged as a key technology that will transform the way in which we share information. Building trust in distributed environments without the need for authorities is a technological advance that has the potential to change many industries, the loT among them. Disruptive technologies such as big data and cloud computing have been leveraged by loT to overcome its limitations since its conception, and we think blockchain will be one of the next ones. This paper focuses on this relationship, investigates challenges in blockchain loT applications, and surveys the most relevant work in order to analyze how blockchain could potentially improve the loT.

Given the increased attention, there little is known about the behaviour of Bitcoin prices and therefore we add to the literature by studying price clustering. We find significant evidence of clustering at round numbers, with over 10% of prices ending with 00 decimals compared to other variations but there is no significant pattern of returns after the round number. We also support the negotiation hypothesis of Harris (1991) by showing that price and volume have a significant positive relationship with price clustering at whole numbers. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI Affinity Purification of Multifunctional Polymer Nanoparticles
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB We report that multifunctional polymer nanoparticles approximately the size of a large protein can be "purified", on the basis of peptide affinity just as antibodies, using an affinity chromatography strategy. The selection process takes advantage of the thermoresponsiveness of the nanoparticles allowing "catch and release" of the target peptide by adjusting the temperature. Purified particles show much stronger affinity (K(dapp) approximate to nM) and a narrower affinity distribution than the average of particles before purification (K(dapp) > mu M) at room temperature but can release the peptide just by changing the temperature. We anticipate this affinity selection will be general and become an integral step for the preparation of "plastic antibodies" with near-homogeneous and tailored affinity for target biomacromolecules.

AB The paradigm of Internet of Things (IoT) is paving the way for a world, where many of our daily objects will be interconnected and will interact with their environment in order to collect information and automate certain tasks. Such a vision requires, among other things, seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self-maintenance. Such features can be brought by blockchain, a technology born with a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. In this paper, a thorough review on how to adapt blockchain to the specific needs of IoT in order to develop Blockchain-based IoT (BIoT) applications is presented. After describing the basics of blockchain, the most relevant BIoT applications are described with the objective of emphasizing how blockchain can impact traditional cloud-centered IoT applications. Then, the current challenges and possible optimizations are detailed regarding many aspects that affect the design, development, and deployment of a BIoT application. Finally, some recommendations are enumerated with the aim of guiding future BIoT researchers and developers on some of the issues that will have to be tackled before deploying the next generation of BIoT applications.

After decomposing Bitcoin returns into various frequencies, i.e., investment horizons, and given evidence of heavy-tails, we employ quantile regression. We reveal that Bitcoin does act as a hedge against uncertainty: it reacts positively to uncertainty at both higher quantiles and shorter frequency movements of Bitcoin returns. Further, we use quantile-on-quantile regression and identify that hedging is observed at shorter investment horizons, and at both lower and upper ends of Bitcoin returns and global uncertainty.

AB Security and privacy are huge challenges in Internet of Things (IoT) environments, but unfortunately, the harmonization of the IoT-related standards and protocols is hardly and slowly widespread. In this paper, we propose a new framework for access control in IoT based on the blockchain technology. Our first contribution consists in providing a reference model for our proposed framework within the Objectives, Models, Architecture and Mechanism specification in IoT. In addition, we introduce FairAccess as a fully decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that enables users to own and control their data. To implement our model, we use and adapt the blockchain into a decentralized access control manager. Unlike financial bitcoin transactions, FairAccess introduces new types of transactions that are used to grant, get, delegate, and revoke access. As a proof of concept, we establish an initial implementation with a Raspberry PI device and local blockchain. Finally, we discuss some limitations and propose further opportunities.

TI Crypto-currency bubbles: an application of the Phillips-Shi-Yu (2013)
   methodology on Mt. Gox bitcoin prices
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB The creation of bitcoin heralded the arrival of digital or crypto-currency and has been regarded as a phenomenon. Since its introduction, it has experienced a meteoric rise in price and rapid growth accompanied by huge volatility swings, and also attracted plenty of controversies which even involved law enforcement agencies. Hence, claims abound that bitcoin has been characterized by bubbles ready to burst any time (e.g. the recent collapse of bitcoin's biggest exchange, Mt Gox). This has earned plenty of coverage in the media but surprisingly not in the academic literature. We therefore fill this knowledge gap. We conduct an econometric investigation of the existence of bubbles in the bitcoin market based on a recently developed technique that is robust in detecting bubbles -that of Phillips et al. (2013a). Over the period 2010-2014, we detected a number of short-lived bubbles; most importantly, we found three huge bubbles in the latter part of the period 2011-2013 lasting from 66 to 106 days, with the last and biggest one being the one that 'broke the camel's back' - the demise of the Mt Gox exchange.

TI When Intrusion Detection Meets Blockchain Technology: A Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the purpose of identifying cyber threats and possible incidents, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are widely deployed in various computer networks. In order to enhance the detection capability of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection networks (or collaborative IDSs) have been developed, which allow IDS nodes to exchange data with each other. However, data and trust management still remain two challenges for current detection architectures, which may degrade the effectiveness of such detection systems. In recent years, blockchain technology has shown its adaptability in many fields, such as supply chain management, international payment, interbanking, and so on. As blockchain can protect the integrity of data storage and ensure process transparency, it has a potential to be applied to intrusion detection domain. Motivated by this, this paper provides a review regarding the intersection of IDSs and blockchains. In particular, we introduce the background of intrusion detection and blockchain, discuss the applicability of blockchain to intrusion detection, and identify open challenges in this direction.

TI Blockchain Based Decentralized Management of Demand Response Programs in
   Smart Energy Grids
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, we investigate the use of decentralized blockchain mechanisms for delivering transparent, secure, reliable, and timely energy flexibility, under the form of adaptation of energy demand profiles of Distributed Energy Prosumers, to all the stakeholders involved in the flexibility markets (Distribution System Operators primarily, retailers, aggregators, etc.). In our approach, a blockchain based distributed ledger stores in a tamper proof manner the energy prosumption information collected from Internet of Things smart metering devices, while self-enforcing smart contracts programmatically define the expected energy flexibility at the level of each prosumer, the associated rewards or penalties, and the rules for balancing the energy demand with the energy production at grid level. Consensus based validation will be used for demand response programs validation and to activate the appropriate financial settlement for the flexibility providers. The approach was validated using a prototype implemented in an Ethereum platform using energy consumption and production traces of several buildings from literature data sets. The results show that our blockchain based distributed demand side management can be used for matching energy demand and production at smart grid level, the demand response signal being followed with high accuracy, while the amount of energy flexibility needed for convergence is reduced.

AB We document our experiences in teaching smart contract programming to undergraduate students at the University of Maryland, the first pedagogical attempt of its kind. Since smart contracts deal directly with the movement of valuable currency units between contractual parties, security of a contract program is of paramount importance.
   Our lab exposed numerous common pitfalls in designing safe and secure smart contracts. We document several typical classes of mistakes students made, suggest ways to fix/avoid them, and advocate best practices for programming smart contracts. Finally, our pedagogical efforts have also resulted in online open course materials for programming smart contracts, which may be of independent interest to the community.

AB Bitcoin is widely regarded as the first broadly successful e-cash system. An oft-cited concern, though, is that mining Bitcoins wastes computational resources. Indeed, Bitcoin's underlying mining mechanism, which we call a scratch-off puzzle (SOP), involves continuously attempting to solve computational puzzles that have no intrinsic utility.
   We propose a modification to Bitcoin that repurposes its mining resources to achieve a more broadly useful goal: distributed storage of archival data. We call our new scheme Permacoin. Unlike Bitcoin and its proposed alternatives, Permacoin requires clients to invest not just computational resources, but also storage. Our scheme involves an alternative scratch-off puzzle for Bitcoin based on Proofs-of Retrievability (PORs). Successfully minting money with this SOP requires local, random access to a copy of a file. Given the competition among mining clients in Bitcoin, this modified SOP gives rise to highly decentralized file storage, thus reducing the overall waste of Bitcoin.
   Using a model of rational economic agents we show that our modified SOP preserves the essential properties of the original Bitcoin puzzle. We also provide parameterizations and calculations based on realistic hardware constraints to demonstrate the practicality of Permacoin as a whole.

TI Block-VN: A Distributed Blockchain Based Vehicular Network Architecture

SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB In recent decades, the ad hoc network for vehicles has been a core network technology to provide comfort and security to drivers in vehicle environments. However, emerging applications and services require major changes in underlying network models and computing that require new road network planning. Meanwhile, blockchain widely known as one of the disruptive technologies has emerged in recent years, is experiencing rapid development and has the potential to revolutionize intelligent transport systems. Blockchain can be used to build an intelligent, secure, distributed and autonomous transport system. It allows better utilization of the infrastructure and resources of intelligent transport systems, particularly effective for crowdsourcing technology. In this paper, we proposes a vehicle network architecture based on blockchain in the smart city (Block-VN). Block-VN is a reliable and secure architecture that operates in a distributed way to build the new distributed transport management system. We are considering a new network system of vehicles, Block-VN, above them. In addition, we examine how the network of vehicles evolves with paradigms focused on networking and vehicular information. Finally, we discuss service scenarios and design principles for Block-VN.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralised and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where agreement on shared states can be established without trusting a central integration point. A major difficulty for architects designing applications based on blockchain is that the technology has many configurations and variants. Since blockchains are at an early stage, there is little product data or reliable technology evaluation available to compare different blockchains. In this paper, we propose how to classify and compare blockchains and blockchain-based systems to assist with the design and assessment of their impact on software architectures. Our taxonomy captures major architectural characteristics of blockchains and the impact of their principal design decisions. This taxonomy is intended to help with important architectural considerations about the performance and quality attributes of blockchain-based systems.

AB Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Their key envisioned uses (e.g. financial instruments) require them to consume data from outside the blockchain (e.g. stock quotes). Trustworthy data feeds that support a broad range of data requests will thus be critical to smart contract ecosystems.
   We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC acts as a bridge between smart contracts and existing web sites, which are already commonly trusted for non-blockchain applications. It combines a blockchain front end with a trusted hardware back end to scrape HTTPS-enabled websites and serve source -authenticated data to relying smart contracts.
   TC also supports confidentiality. It enables private data requests with encrypted parameters. Additionally, in a generalization that executes smart-contract logic within TC, the system permits secure use of user credentials to scrape access-controlled online data sources.
   We describe TC's design principles and architecture and report on an implementation that uses Intel's recently introduced Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to furnish data to the Ethereum smart contract system. We formally model TC and define and prove its basic security properties in the Universal Composibility (UC) framework. Our results include definitions and techniques of general interest relating to resource consumption (Ethereum's "gas" fee system) and TCB minimization. We also report on experiments with three example applications.
   We plan to launch TC soon as an online public service.

We build on the emergent phenomenon of currency mixes, adding an accountability mechanism to expose theft. We demonstrate that incentives of mixes and clients can be aligned to ensure that rational mixes will not steal. Our scheme is efficient and fully compatible with Bitcoin. Against a passive attacker, our scheme provides an anonymity set of all other users mixing coins contemporaneously. This is an interesting new property with no clear analog in better-studied communication mixes. Against active attackers our scheme offers similar anonymity to traditional communication mixes.

AB Blockchain technologies are taking the world by storm. Public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, enable secure peer-to-peer applications like crypto-currency or smart contracts. Their security and performance are well studied. This paper concerns recent private blockchain systems designed with stronger security (trust) assumption and performance requirement. These systems target and aim to disrupt applications which have so far been implemented on top of database systems, for example banking, finance and trading applications. Multiple platforms for private blockchains are being actively developed and fine tuned. However, there is a clear lack of a systematic framework with which different systems can be analyzed and compared against each other. Such a framework can be used to assess blockchains' viability as another distributed data processing platform, while helping developers to identify bottlenecks and accordingly improve their platforms.
   In this paper, we first describe BLOCKBENCH, the first evaluation framework for analyzing private blockchains. It serves as a fair means of comparison for different platforms and enables deeper understanding of different system design choices. Any private blockchain can be integrated to BLOCKBENCH via simple APIs and benchmarked against workloads that are based on real and synthetic smart contracts. BLOCKBENCH measures overall and component-wise performance in terms of throughput, latency, scalability and fault-tolerance. Next, we use BLOCKBENCH to conduct comprehensive evaluation of three major private blockchains: Ethereum, Parity and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate that these systems are still far from displacing current database systems in traditional data processing workloads. Furthermore, there are gaps in performance among the three systems which are attributed to the design choices at different layers of the blockchain's software stack. We have released BLOCKBENCH for public use.

SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB The relationship between the internal structure of amylopectin from diverse plants and thermal properties of the starch granules has been investigated. Correlations were found between structural parameters, such as number of building blocks in clusters, interblock chain length and length of external chains, and gelatinization parameters. Onset gelatinization temperature negatively correlated with number of building blocks (r= -0.952,p < 0.01) and positively correlated with inter-block chain length (r= 0.905, p < 0.01). Enthalpy of gelatinization positively correlated with external chain length (r= 0.854,p < 0.01). These data showed that the internal structure is predictive of trends in thermal properties. A model is proposed based on the backbone concept of amylopectin structure that explains how the organization of chains in the semicrystalline lamellae of starch granules relates to the thermal properties.

TI BBDS: Blockchain-Based Data Sharing for Electronic Medical Records in
   Cloud Environments
SO INFORMATION
AB Disseminating medical data beyond the protected cloud of institutions poses severe risks to patients' privacy, as breaches push them to the point where they abstain from full disclosure of their condition. This situation negatively impacts the patient, scientific research, and all stakeholders. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based data sharing framework that sufficiently addresses the access control challenges associated with sensitive data stored in the cloud using immutability and built-in autonomy properties of the blockchain. Our system is based on a permissioned blockchain which allows access to only invited, and hence verified users. As a result of this design, further accountability is guaranteed as all users are already known and a log of their actions is kept by the blockchain. The system permits users to request data from the shared pool after their identities and cryptographic keys are verified. The evidence from the system evaluation shows that our scheme is lightweight, scalable, and efficient.

TI Price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem
SO JOURNAL OF MONETARY ECONOMICS
AB To its proponents, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin offers the potential to disrupt payment systems and traditional currencies. It has also been subject to security breaches and wild price fluctuations. This paper identifies and analyzes the impact of suspicious trading activity on the Mt. Gox Bitcoin currency exchange, in which approximately 600,000 bitcoins (BTC) valued at $188 million were fraudulently acquired. During both periods, the USD-BTC exchange rate rose by an average of four percent on days when suspicious trades took place, compared to a slight decline on days without suspicious activity. Based on rigorous analysis with extensive robustness checks, the paper demonstrates that the suspicious trading activity likely caused the unprecedented spike in the USD-BTC exchange rate in late 2013, when the rate jumped from around $150 to more than $1,000 in two months.

TI Blockchain: A Panacea for Healthcare Cloud-Based Data Security and
   Privacy?
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
AB One particular trend observed in healthcare is the progressive shift of data and services to the cloud, partly due to convenience (e.g. availability of complete patient medical history in real-time) and savings (e.g. economics of healthcare data management). There are, however, limitations to using conventional cryptographic primitives and access control models to address security and privacy concerns in an increasingly cloud-based environment. In this paper, we study the potential to use the Blockchain technology to protect healthcare data hosted within the cloud. We also describe the practical challenges of such a proposition and further research that is required.

TI Price Fluctuations and the Use of Bitcoin: An Empirical Inquiry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
AB Over recent years, interest has been growing in Bitcoin, an innovation that has the potential to play an important role in e-commerce and beyond. The aim of our paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical study of the payment and investment features of Bitcoin, and their implications for the conduct of e-commerce. Since network externality theory suggests that the value of a network and its take-up are interlinked, we investigate both adoption and price formation. We discover that its returns are driven primarily by Bitcoin's popularity, the sentiment expressed in newspaper reports on cryptocurrency, and total number of transactions. The paper also reports on the first global survey of merchants who have adopted this technology, and we model the share of sales paid for with this alternative currency, using both ordinary and Tobit regressions. Our analysis examines how country-, customer-, and company-specific characteristics interact with the proportion of sales attributed to Bitcoin. We find that company features, use of other payment methods, customers' knowledge about Bitcoin, and the size of both the official and unofficial economy are significant determinants. The results will be of interest to traders who seek to understand factors driving prices and will help to inform vendors as to the most favorable circumstances for adopting the currency for online transactions.

AB The integration of business processes across organizations is typically beneficial for all involved parties. However, the lack of trust is often a roadblock. Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a network of untrusted participants. It can be used to find agreement about the shared state of collaborating parties without trusting a central authority or any particular participant. Some blockchain networks also provide a computational infrastructure to run autonomous programs called smart contracts. In this paper, we address the fundamental problem of trust in collaborative process execution using blockchain. We develop a technique to integrate blockchain into the choreography of processes in such a way that no central authority is needed, but trust maintained. Our solution comprises the combination of an intricate set of components, which allow monitoring or coordination of business processes. We implemented our solution and demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to three use case processes. Our evaluation includes the creation of more than 500 smart contracts and the execution over 8,000 blockchain transactions.

TI Blockchain-based sharing services: What blockchain technology can
   contribute to smart cities
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Background: The notion of smart city has grown popular over the past few years. It embraces several dimensions depending on the meaning of the word "smart" and benefits from innovative applications of new kinds of information and communications technology to support communal sharing.
   Methods: By relying on prior literature, this paper proposes a conceptual framework with three dimensions: (1) human, (2) technology, and (3) organization, and explores a set of fundamental factors that make a city smart from a sharing economy perspective.
   Results: Using this triangle framework, we discuss what emerging blockchain technology may contribute to these factors and how its elements can help smart cities develop sharing services.
   Conclusions: This study discusses how blockchain-based sharing services can contribute to smart cities based on a conceptual framework. We hope it can stimulate interest in theory and practice to foster discussions in this area.

TI A Secure System For Pervasive Social Network-Based Healthcare
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Modern technologies of mobile computing and wireless sensing prompt the concept of pervasive social network (PSN)-based healthcare. To realize the concept, the core problem is how a PSN node can securely share health data with other nodes in the network. In this paper, we propose a secure system for PSN-based healthcare. Two protocols are designed for the system. The first one is an improved version of the IEEE 802.15.6 display authenticated association. It establishes secure links with unbalanced computational requirements for mobile devices and resource-limited sensor nodes. The second protocol uses blockchain technique to share health data among PSN nodes. We realize a protocol suite to study protocol runtime and other factors. In addition, human body channels are proposed for PSN nodes in some use cases. The proposed system illustrates a potential method of using blockchain for PSN-based applications.

TI Blockchain application and outlook in the banking industry
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Blockchain technology is a core, underlying technology with promising application prospects in the banking industry. On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of "multi-center, weakly intermediated" scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a "regulatory sandbox" and the development of industry standards.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology for decentralized and transactional data sharing across a large network of untrusted participants. It enables new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can find agreements on their shared states without trusting a central integration point or any particular participating components. Considering the blockchain as a software connector helps make explicitly important architectural considerations on the resulting performance and quality attributes (for example, security, privacy, scalability and sustainability) of the system. Based on our experience in several projects using blockchain, in this paper we provide rationales to support the architectural decision on whether to employ a decentralized blockchain as opposed to other software solutions, like traditional shared data storage. Additionally, we explore specific implications of using the blockchain as a software connector including design trade-offs regarding quality attributes.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency which relies on a distributed set of miners to mint coins and on a peer-to-peer network to broadcast transactions. The identities of Bitcoin users are hidden behind pseudonyms (public keys) which are recommended to be changed frequently in order to increase transaction unlinkability.
   We present an efficient method to deanonymize Bitcoin users, which allows to link user pseudonyms to the IP addresses where the transactions are generated. Our techniques work for the most common and the most challenging scenario when users are behind NATs or firewalls of their ISPs. They allow to link transactions of a user behind a NAT and to distinguish connections and transactions of different users behind the same NAT. We also show that a natural countermeasure of using Tor or other anonymity services can be cut-off by abusing anti-DoS countermeasures of the Bitcoin network. Our attacks require only a few machines and have been experimentally verified. The estimated success rate is between 11% and 60% depending on how stealthy an attacker wants to be. We propose several countermeasures to mitigate these new attacks.

TI Safer scoring? Cryptomarkets, social supply and drug market violence
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
AB Background: Cryptomarkets are digital platforms that use anonymising software (e.g. Tor) and cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) to facilitate trade of goods and services, most notably illicit drugs. Cryptomarkets may reduce systemic violence compared with in-person drug trading because no face-to-face contact is required and disputes can be resolved through a neutral third party. In this paper, we describe the purchasing behaviour of cryptomarket users and then compare the self-reported experiences of threats, violence and other drug-market concerns when obtaining drugs from cryptomarkets with obtaining drugs through friends, known dealers and strangers.
   Methods: The Global Drug Survey was completed in late 2014 by a self-selected sample who reported accessing drugs through cryptomarkets in the last 12 months (N = 3794).
   Results: Their median age was 22 years and 82% were male. The drug types most commonly obtained through cryptomarkets were MDMA/Ecstasy (55%), cannabis (43%) and LSD (35%). Cryptomarket users reported using a median of 2 sources in addition to cryptomarkets to access drugs, the most common being in-person friendships (74%), in-person dealers (57%) and open markets/strangers (26%). When asked to nominate the main source they would use if cryptomarkets were unavailable, 49% nominated friends, 34% known dealers and 4% strangers. 'Threats to personal safety' (3%) and 'experiencing physical violence' (1%) were less often reported when using cryptomarkets compared with sourcing through friends (14%; 6%), known dealers (24%; 10%) or strangers (35%; 15%). Concerns about drug impurities and law enforcement were reported more often when using the alternative source, while loss of money, waiting too long and not receiving the product were more often reported when using cryptomarkets.
   Conclusion: Cryptomarkets are associated with substantially less threats and violence than alternative market types used by cryptomarket customers, even though a large majority of these alternatives were closed networks where violence should be relatively less common.

AB Ethereum is a framework for cryptocurrencies which uses blockchain technology to provide an open global computing platform, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM executes bytecode on a simple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like language, called Solidity, that compiles to bytecode. Since the main purpose of EVM is to execute smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets (called Ether), security is of paramount importance. However, writing secure smart contracts can be extremely difficult: due to the openness of Ethereum, both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs, leading to potentially dangerous compositions of trusted and untrusted code. This risk was recently illustrated by an attack on TheDAO contract that exploited subtle details of the EVM semantics to transfer roughly $50M worth of Ether into the control of an attacker. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Ethereum contracts by translation to F*, a functional programming language aimed at program verification.

AB Over the last 4 years, Bitcoin, a decentralized P2P cryptocurrency, has gained widespread attention. The ability to create pseudoanonymous financial transactions using bitcoins has made the currency attractive to users who value their privacy. Although previous work has analyzed the degree of anonymity Bitcoin offers using clustering and flow analysis, none have demonstrated the ability to map Bitcoin addresses directly to IP data. We propose a novel approach to creating and evaluating such mappings solely using real-time transaction traffic collected over 5 months. We developed heuristics for identifying ownership relationships between Bitcoin addresses and IP addresses. We discuss the circumstances under which these relationships become apparent and demonstrate how nearly 1,000 Bitcoin addresses can be mapped to their likely owner IPs by leveraging anomalous relaying behavior.

TI Preparation and in Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of Silver-Bearing
   Degradable Polymeric Nanoparticles of
   Polyphosphoester-block-Poly(L-lactide)
SO ACS NANO
AB The development of well-defined polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as delivery carriers for antimicrobials targeting human infectious diseases requires rational design of the polymer template, an efficient synthetic approach, and fundamental understanding of the developed NPs, e.g., drug loading/release, particle stability, and other characteristics. Herein, we developed and evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of silver-bearing, fully biodegradable and functional polymeric NPs. A series of degradable polymeric nanoparticles (dNPs), composed of phosphoester and l-lactide and designed specifically for silver loading into the hydrophilic shell and/or the hydrophobic core, were prepared as potential delivery carriers for three different types of silver-based antimicrobialssilver acetate or one of two silver carbene complexes (SCCs). Silver-loading capacities of the dNPs were not influenced by the hydrophilic block chain length, loading site (i.e., core or shell), or type of silver compound, but optimization of the silver feed ratio was crucial to maximize the silver loading capacity of dNPs, up to ca. 12% (w/w). The release kinetics of silver-bearing dNPs revealed 50% release at ca. 2.55.5 h depending on the type of silver compound. In addition, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the rates of hydrolytic or enzymatic degradability and performed structural characterization of the degradation products. Interestingly, packaging of the SCCs in the dNP-based delivery system improved minimum inhibitory concentrations up to 70%, compared with the SCCs alone, as measured in vitro against 10 contemporary epidemic strains of Staphylococcus aureus and eight uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli. We conclude that these dNP-based delivery systems may be beneficial for direct epithelial treatment and/or prevention of ubiquitous bacterial infections, including those of the skin and urinary tract.

TI Datestamping the Bitcoin and Ethereum bubbles
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We examine the existence and dates of pricing bubbles in Bitcoin and Ethereum, two popular cryptocurrencies using the (Phillips et al., 2011) methodology. In contrast to previous papers, we examine the fundamental drivers of the price. Having derived ratios that are economically and computationally sensible, we use these variables to detect and datestamp bubbles. Our conclusion is that there are periods of clear bubble behaviour, with Bitcoin now almost certainly in a bubble phase.

TI Majority Is Not Enough: Bitcoin Mining Is Vulnerable
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed.
   We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency.
   Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.

AB We apply the FLUSH+RELOAD side-channel attack based on cache hits/misses to extract a small amount of data from OpenSSL ECDSA signature requests. We then apply a "standard" lattice technique to extract the private key, but unlike previous attacks we are able to make use of the side-channel information from almost all of the observed executions. This means we obtain private key recovery by observing a relatively small number of executions, and by expending a relatively small amount of post-processing via lattice reduction. We demonstrate our analysis via experiments using the curve secp256k1 used in the Bitcoin protocol. In particular we show that with as little as 200 signatures we are able to achieve a reasonable level of success in recovering the secret key for a 256-bit curve. This is significantly better than prior methods of applying lattice reduction techniques to similar side channel information.

TI Untangling Blockchain: A Data Processing View of Blockchain Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING
AB Blockchain technologies are gaining massive momentum in the last few years. Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable parties who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. The parties agree on the existence, values, and histories of the states. As the technology landscape is expanding rapidly, it is both important and challenging to have a firm grasp of what the core technologies have to offer, especially with respect to their data processing capabilities. In this paper, we first survey the state of the art, focusing on private blockchains (in which parties are authenticated). We analyze both in-production and research systems in four dimensions: distributed ledger, cryptography, consensus protocol, and smart contract. We then present BLOCKBENCH, a benchmarking framework for understanding performance of private blockchains against data processing workloads. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of three major blockchain systems based on BLOCKBENCH, namely Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric. The results demonstrate several trade-offs in the design space, as well as big performance gaps between blockchain and database systems. Drawing from design principles of database systems, we discuss several research directions for bringing blockchain performance closer to the realm of databases.

TI Blockchain-based secure firmware update for embedded devices in an
   Internet of Things environment
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Embedded devices are going to be used extremely in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The small and tiny IoT devices will operate and communicate each other without involvement of users, while their operations must be correct and protected against various attacks. In this paper, we focus on a secure firmware update issue, which is a fundamental security challenge for the embedded devices in an IoT environment. A new firmware update scheme that utilizes a blockchain technology is proposed to securely check a firmware version, validate the correctness of firmware, and download the latest firmware for the embedded devices. In the proposed scheme, an embedded device requests its firmware update to nodes in a blockchain network and gets a response to determine whether its firmware is up-to-date or not. If not latest, the embedded device downloads the latest firmware from a peer-to-peer firmware sharing network of the nodes. Even in the case that the version of the firmware is up-to-date, its integrity, i.e., correctness of firmware, is checked. The proposed scheme guarantees that the embedded device's firmware is up-to-date while not tampered. Attacks targeting known vulnerabilities on firmware of embedded devices are thus mitigated.

SO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, have ignited intense discussions. Despite receiving extensive public attention, theoretical understanding is limited regarding the value of blockchain-based cryptocurrendes, as expressed in their exchange rates against traditional currencies. In this paper, we conduct a theory-driven empirical study of the Bitcoin exchange rate (against USD) determination, taking into consideration both technology and economic factors. To address co-integration in a mix of stationary and non-stationary time series, we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model with a bounds test approach in the estimation. Meanwhile, to detect potential structural changes, we estimate our empirical model on two periods separated by the closure of Mt. Gox (one of the largest Bitcoin exchange markets). According to our analysis, in the short term, the Bitcoin exchange rate adjusts to changes in economic fundamentals and market conditions. The long-term Bitcoin exchange rate is more sensitive to economic fundamentals and less sensitive to technological factors after Mt. Gox closed. We also identify a significant impact of mining technology and a decreasing significance of mining difficulty in the Bitcoin exchange price determination.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain in government: Benefits and implications of distributed
   ledger technology for information sharing
SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
AB Blockchain refers to a range of general purpose technologies to exchange information and transact digital assets in distributed networks. The core question addressed in this paper is whether blockchain technology will lead to innovation and transformation of governmental processes. To address this question we present a critical assessment of the often exaggerated benefits of blockchain technology found in the literature and discuss their implications for governmental organizations and processes. We plea for a shift from a technology-driven to need driven approach in which blockchain applications are customized to ensure a fit with requirements of administrative processes and in which the administrative processes are changed to benefit from the technology. Having sound governance models are found to be a condition for realizing benefits. Based on a critical assessment we offer directions for further research into the potential benefits of BC applications in e-government and the role of governance of BC architectures and applications to comply with societal needs and public values.

AB Proofs of work (PoW) have been suggested by Dwork and Naor (Crypto'92) as protection to a shared resource. The basic idea is to ask the service requestor to dedicate some non-trivial amount of computational work to every request. The original applications included prevention of spam and protection against denial of service attacks. More recently, PoWs have been used to prevent double spending in the Bitcoin digital currency system.
   In this work, we put forward an alternative concept for PoWs - so-called proofs of space (PoS), where a service requestor must dedicate a significant amount of disk space as opposed to computation. We construct secure PoS schemes in the random oracle model (with one additional mild assumption required for the proof to go through), using graphs with high "pebbling complexity" and Merkle hash-trees. We discuss some applications, including follow-up work where a decentralized digital currency scheme called Spacecoin is constructed that uses PoS (instead of wasteful PoW like in Bitcoin) to prevent double spending.
   The main technical contribution of this work is the construction of (directed, loop-free) graphs on N vertices with in-degree O(log log N) such that even if one places Theta(N) pebbles on the nodes of the graph, there's a constant fraction of nodes that needs Theta(N) steps to be pebbled (where in every step one can put a pebble on a node if all its parents have a pebble).

TI Difficulty control for blockchain-based consensus systems
SO PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS
AB Crypto-currencies like Bitcoin have recently attracted a lot of interest. A crucial ingredient into such systems is the "mining" of a Nakamoto blockchain. We model mining as a Poisson process with time-dependent intensity and use this model to derive predictions about block times for various hash-rate scenarios (exponentially rising hash rate being the most important). We also analyse Bitcoin's method to update the "network difficulty" as a mechanism to keep block times stable. Since it yields systematically too fast blocks for exponential hash-rate growth, we propose a new method to update difficulty. Our proposed method performs much better at ensuring stable average block times over longer periods of time, which we verify both in simulations of artificial growth scenarios and with real-world data. Besides Bitcoin itself, this has practical benefits particularly for systems like Namecoin. It can be used to make name expiration times more predictable, preventing accidental loss of names.

SO DESALINATION
AB A positively charged polyamide composite nanofiltration (NF) hollow fiber membrane for lithium and magnesium separation was fabricated by the interfacial polymerization of 1,4-Bis(3-aminopropyl)piperazine (DAPP) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) on the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration hollow fiber membrane. The chemical structure, morphology and surface charge of the composite membrane were characterized by using ATR-FTIR, XPS, SEM, AFM and zeta potential analyzer. The performance of the composite membrane was tested with various salts in aqueous solution (2000 ppm) at the operating pressure of 0.3 MPa. The results showed that the membrane performance was related to the changes of the monomer content in the aqueous phase rather than that in the organic phase. Furthermore, the salt rejection order of the membrane was MgCl2 > MgSO4 > NaCl >= LiCl. The difference between the rejections of MgCl2 and LiCl reached to 47.5%. The zeta potential measurements indicated that the surface of the resultant membrane was positively charged at pH values below 9.5. Moreover, the mass ratio of Mg2+/Li+ decreased from initial 20:1 in the feed of 2.0 g/L MgCl2 and LiCl mixture to 7.7:1 in the permeate after the filtration by the composite membrane.

Diblock copolymer PS-b-P4VP can self-assemble into patchy particles with P4VP protuberances on their surface using the emulsion solvent evaporation method. After cross-linking the P4VP protuberances, Janus NPs are produced by disassembling the particles. Within the P4VP domains, other species including metallic and inorganic are preferentially grown to extend composition and functionality. The Janus NPs are amphiphilic and capable to self-organize into superstructures. The size ratio of P4VP/PS and thus the Janus balance of the NPs are tunable by changing block chain length ratio of the block copolymers.

TI Blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy
SO TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
AB This paper evaluates blockchain's roles in strengthening cybersecurity and protecting privacy. Since most of the data is currently stored in cloud data centers, it also compares how blockchain performs vis-vis the cloud in various aspects of security and privacy. Key underlying mechanisms related to the blockchain's impacts on the Internet of Things (IoT) security are also covered. From the security and privacy considerations, it highlights how blockchain-based solutions could possibly be, in many aspects, superior to-the current IoT ecosystem, which mainly relies on centralized cloud servers through service providers. Using practical applications and real-world examples, the paper argues that blockchain's decentralized feature is likely to result in a low susceptibility to manipulation and forgery by malicious participants. Special consideration is also given to how blockchain-based identity and access management systems can address some of the key challenges associated with IoT security. The paper provides a detailed analysis and description of blockchain's roles in tracking the sources of insecurity in supply chains related to IoT devices. The paper also delves into how blockchain can make it possible to contain an IoT security breach in a targeted way after it is discovered. It discusses and evaluates initiatives of organizations, inter organizational networks and industries on this front. A number of policy implications are discussed. First, in order to strengthen IoT, regulators can make it obligatory for firms to deploy blockchain in supply chain, especially in systems that are mission critical, and have substantial national security and economic benefits. Second, public policy efforts directed at protecting privacy using blockchain should focus on providing training to key stakeholders and increasing investment in this technology. Third, one way to enrich the blockchain ecosystem would be to turn attention to public private partnerships. Finally, riational governments should provide legal clarity and more information for parties to engage in smart contracts that are enforceable.

Originally developed as a methodology to record cryptocurrency transactions, blockchain's functionality has evolved into a large number of applications, such as banking, financial markets, insurance, voting systems, leasing contracts, and government service. Despite such advancements, the application of blockchain to accounting and assurance remains under-explored. This paper aims to provide an initial discussion on how blockchain could enable a real-time, verifiable, and transparent accounting ecosystem. Additionally, blockchain has the potential to transform current auditing practices, resulting in a more precise and timely automatic assurance system.

TI BEYOND BITCOIN: ISSUES IN REGULATING BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS
SO DUKE LAW JOURNAL
AB The buzz surrounding Bitcoin has reached a fever pitch. Yet in academic legal discussions, disproportionate emphasis is placed on bitcoins (that is, virtual currency), and little mention is made of blockchain technology the true innovation behind the Bitcoin protocol. Simply, blockchain technology solves an elusive networking problem by enabling "trustless" transactions: value exchanges over computer networks that can be verified, monitored, and enforced without central institutions (for example, banks). This has broad implications for how we transact over electronic networks.
   This Note integrates current research from leading computer scientists and cryptographers to elevate the legal community's understanding of blockchain technology and, ultimately, to inform policymakers and practitioners as they consider different regulatory schemes. An examination of the economic properties of a blockchain-based currency suggests the technology's true value lies in its potential to facilitate more efficient digital-asset transfers. For example, applications of special interest to the legal community include more efficient document and authorship verification, title transfers, and contract enforcement. Though a regulatory patchwork around virtual currencies has begun to form, its careful analysis reveals much uncertainty with respect to these alternative applications.

AB Bitcoin, the famous peer-to-peer, decentralized electronic currency system, allows users to benefit from pseudonymity, by generating an arbitrary number of aliases (or addresses) to move funds. However, the complete history of all transactions ever performed, called "blockchain", is public and replicated on each node. The data it contains is difficult to analyze manually, but can yield a high number of relevant information. In this paper we present a modular framework, BitIodine, which parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are likely to belong to a same user or group of users, classifies such users and labels them, and finally visualizes complex information extracted from the Bitcoin network. BitIodine labels users semi-automatically with information on their identity and actions which is automatically scraped from openly available information sources. BitIodine also supports manual investigation by finding paths and reverse paths between addresses or users. We tested BitIodine on several real-world use cases, identified an address likely to belong to the encrypted Silk Road cold wallet, or investigated the CryptoLocker ransomware and accurately quantified the number of ransoms paid, as well as information about the victims. We release a prototype of BitIodine as a library for building Bitcoin forensic analysis tools.

TI High-affinity dopamine D-2/D-3 PET radioligands F-18-fallypride and
   C-11-FLB457: A comparison of kinetics in extrastriatal regions using a
   multiple-injection protocol
SO JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM
AB F-18-Fallypride and C-11-FLB457 are commonly used PET radioligands for imaging extrastriatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors, but differences in their in vivo kinetics may affect the sensitivity for measuring subtle changes in receptor binding. Focusing on regions of low binding, a direct comparison of the kinetics of F-18-fallypride and C-11-FLB457 was made using a MI protocol. Injection protocols were designed to estimate K-1, k(2), f(ND)k(on), B-max, and k(off) in the midbrain and cortical regions of the rhesus monkey. 11C-FLB457 cleared from the arterial plasma faster and yielded a ND space distribution volume (K-1/k(2)) that is three times higher than 18F-fallypride, primarily due to a slower k(2) (FAL: FLB; k(2) = 0.54 min(-1): 0.18 min(-1)). The dissociation rate constant, koff, was slower for C-11-FLB457, resulting in a lower K-Dapp than F-18-fallypride (FAL: FLB; 0.39 nM: 0.13 nM). Specific D-2/D-3 binding could be detected in the cerebellum for C-11-FLB457 but not F-18-fallypride. Both radioligands can be used to image extrastriatal D-2/D-3 receptors, with C-11-FLB457 providing greater sensitivity to subtle changes in low-receptor-density cortical regions and F-18-fallypride being more sensitive to endogenous dopamine displacement in medium-to-high-receptor-density regions. In the presence of specific D-2/D-3 binding in the cerebellum, reference region analysis methods will give a greater bias in BPND with C-11-FLB457 than with F-18-fallypride.

AB Access control face big challenges in IoT. Unfortunately, it is hard to implement current access control standards on smart object due to its constrained nature while the introduction of powerful and trusted third party to handle access control logic could harm user privacy. In this work we show how blockchain, the promising technology behind Bitcoin, can be very attractive to face those arising challenges. We therefore propose FairAccess as a new decentralized pseudonymous and privacy preserving authorization management framework that leverages the consistency of blockchain technology to manage access control on behalf of constrained devices.

AB Distributed cryptographic protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use a data structure known as the block chain to synchronize a global log of events between nodes in their network. Blocks, which are batches of updates to the log, reference the parent they are extending, and thus form the structure of a chain. Previous research has shown that the mechanics of the block chain and block propagation are constrained: if blocks are created at a high rate compared to their propagation time in the network, many conflicting blocks are created and performance suffers greatly. As a result of the low block creation rate required to keep the system within safe parameters, transactions take long to securely confirm, and their throughput is greatly limited.
   We propose an alternative structure to the chain that allows for operation at much higher rates. Our structure consists of a directed acyclic graph of blocks (the block DAG). The DAG structure is created by allowing blocks to reference multiple predecessors, and allows for more "forgiving" transaction acceptance rules that incorporate transactions even from seemingly conflicting blocks. Thus, larger blocks that take longer to propagate can be tolerated by the system, and transaction volumes can be increased.
   Another deficiency of block chain protocols is that they favor more connected nodes that spread their blocks faster-fewer of their blocks conflict. We show that with our system the advantage of such highly connected miners is greatly reduced. On the negative side, attackers that attempt to maliciously reverse transactions can try to use the forgiving nature of the DAG structure to lower the costs of their attacks. We provide a security analysis of the protocol and show that such attempts can be easily countered.

AB This work studies long-range correlations and informational efficiency of the Bitcoin market for the period from June 30, 2013 to June 3rd, 2017. To this end, the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) was implemented over sliding windows to estimate long-range correlations for price returns. It was found that the Bitcoin market exhibits periods of efficiency alternating with periods where the price dynamics are driven by anti-persistence. The pattern is replicated by prices samples at day, hour and second frequencies. The Bitcoin market also presents asymmetric correlations with respect to increasing and decreasing price trending, with the former trend linked to anti-persistence of returns dynamics.

TI Decentralized Consensus for Edge-Centric Internet of Things: A Review,
   Taxonomy, and Research Issues
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the exponential rise in the number of devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) is geared toward edge-centric computing to offer high bandwidth, low latency, and improved connectivity. In contrast, legacy cloud-centric platforms offer deteriorated bandwidth and connectivity that affect the quality of service. Edge-centric Internet of Things-based technologies, such as fog and mist computing, offer distributed and decentralized solutions to resolve the drawbacks of cloud-centric models. However, to foster distributed edge-centric models, a decentralized consensus system is necessary to incentivize all participants to share their edge resources. This paper is motivated by the shortage of comprehensive reviews on decentralized consensus systems for edge-centric Internet of Things that elucidates myriad of consensus facets, such as data structure, scalable consensus ledgers, and transaction models. Decentralized consensus systems adopt either blockchain or blockchainless directed acyclic graph technologies, which serve as immutable public ledgers for transactions. This paper scrutinizes the pros and cons of state-of-the-art decentralized consensus systems. With an extensive literature review and categorization based on existing decentralized consensus systems, we propose a thematic taxonomy. The pivotal features and characteristics associated with existing decentralized consensus systems are analyzed via a comprehensive qualitative investigation. The commonalities and variances among these systems are analyzed using key criteria derived from the presented literature. Finally, several open research issues on decentralized consensus for edge-centric IoT are presented, which should be highlighted regarding centralization risk and deficiencies in blockchain/blockchainless solutions.

TI A review of existing and emerging digital technologies to combat the
   global trade in fake medicines
SO EXPERT OPINION ON DRUG SAFETY
AB Introduction: The globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain has introduced new challenges, chief among them, fighting the international criminal trade in fake medicines. As the manufacture, supply, and distribution of drugs becomes more complex, so does the need for innovative technology-based solutions to protect patients globally.
   Areas covered: We conducted a multidisciplinary review of the science/health, information technology, computer science, and general academic literature with the aim of identifying cutting-edge existing and emerging 'digital' solutions to combat fake medicines. Our review identified five distinct categories of technology including mobile, radio frequency identification, advanced computational methods, online verification, and blockchain technology.
   Expert opinion: Digital fake medicine solutions are unifying platforms that integrate different types of anti-counterfeiting technologies as complementary solutions, improve information sharing and data collection, and are designed to overcome existing barriers of adoption and implementation. Investment in this next generation technology is essential to ensure the future security and integrity of the global drug supply chain.

AB While showing great promise, Bitcoin requires users to wait tens of minutes for transactions to commit, and even then, offering only probabilistic guarantees. This paper introduces ByzCoin, a novel Byzantine consensus protocol that leverages scalable collective signing to commit Bitcoin transactions irreversibly within seconds. ByzCoin achieves Byzantine consensus while preserving Bitcoin's open membership by dynamically forming hash power-proportionate consensus groups that represent recently-successful block miners. ByzCoin employs communication trees to optimize transaction commitment and verification under normal operation while guaranteeing safety and liveness under Byzantine faults, up to a near-optimal tolerance of f faulty group members among 3 f + 2 total. ByzCoin mitigates double spending and selfish mining attacks by producing collectively signed transaction blocks within one minute of transaction submission. Tree-structured communication further reduces this latency to less than 30 seconds. Due to these optimizations, ByzCoin achieves a throughput higher than Paypal currently handles, with a confirmation latency of 15-20 seconds.

TI Misbehavior in Bitcoin: A Study of Double-Spending and Accountability
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEM SECURITY
AB Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system that relies on Proof-of-Work (PoW) to resist double-spending through a distributed timestamping service. To ensure the operation and security of Bitcoin, it is essential that all transactions and their order of execution are available to all Bitcoin users.
   Unavoidably, in such a setting, the security of transactions comes at odds with transaction privacy. Motivated by the fact that transaction confirmation in Bitcoin requires tens of minutes, we analyze the conditions for performing successful double-spending attacks against fast payments in Bitcoin, where the time between the exchange of currency and goods is short (in the order of a minute). We show that unless new detection techniques are integrated in the Bitcoin implementation, double-spending attacks on fast payments succeed with considerable probability and can be mounted at low cost. We propose a new and lightweight countermeasure that enables the detection of double-spending attacks in fast transactions.
   In light of such misbehavior, accountability becomes crucial. We show that in the specific case of Bitcoin, accountability complements privacy. To illustrate this tension, we provide accountability and privacy definition for Bitcoin, and we investigate analytically and empirically the privacy and accountability provisions in Bitcoin.

AB Bitcoin is an innovative decentralized cryptocurrency whose core security relies on a "proof of work" procedure, which requires network participants to repeatedly compute hashes on inputs from a large search space. Finding one of the rare inputs that generates an extremely low hash value is considered a successful attempt, allowing miners to approve new transactions and, in return, to collect rewards in bitcoins.
   This reward allocation, which provides the incentive for miners to participate, is a random process with a large variance. Miners who desire a steady income thus often participate in mining pools that divide among their members the earned rewards, and reduce this variance. Mining pools are slightly better at coordinating participants due to lower-latency communication, a fact which implies that they manage to collect slightly higher rewards.
   We examine dynamics of pooled mining and the rewards that pools manage to collect, and use cooperative game theoretic tools to analyze how pool members may share these rewards. We show that for some network parameters, especially under high transaction loads, it is difficult or even impossible to distribute rewards in a stable way: some participants are always incentivized to switch between pools.

TI Conditions for spin-gapless semiconducting behavior in Mn2CoAl inverse
   Heusler compound
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
AB Employing ab initio electronic structure calculations, we investigate the conditions for spin-gapless semiconducting (SGS) behavior in the inverse Mn2CoAl Heusler compound. We show that tetragonalization of the lattice, which can occur during films growth, keeps the SGS character of the perfect cubic compound. On the contrary, atomic swaps even between sites with different local symmetry destroy the SGS character giving rise to a half-metallic state. Furthermore, the occurrence of Co-surplus leads also to half-metallicity. Thus, we propose that in order to achieve SGS behavior during the growth of Mn2CoAl (and similar SGS Heusler compounds) thin films, one should minimize the occurrence of defects, while small deformations of the lattice, due to the lattice mismatch with the substrate, do not play a crucial role.

AB We build a system that provides succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) for program executions on a von Neumann RISC architecture. The system has two components: a cryptographic proof system for verifying satisfiability of arithmetic circuits, and a circuit generator to translate program executions to such circuits. Our design of both components improves in functionality and efficiency over prior work, as follows.
   Our circuit generator is the first to be universal: it does not need to know the program, but only a bound on its running time. Moreover, the size of the output circuit depends additively (rather than multiplicatively) on program size, allowing verification of larger programs. The cryptographic proof system improves proving and verification times, by leveraging new algorithms and a pairing library tailored to the protocol.
   We evaluated our system for programs with up to 10,000 instructions, running for up to 32,000 machine steps, each of which can arbitrarily access random-access memory; and also demonstrated it executing programs that use just-in-time compilation. Our proofs are 230 bytes long at 80 bits of security, or 288 bytes long at 128 bits of security. Typical verification time is 5 ms, regardless of the original program's running time.

AB Hierarchical personality models have the potential to identify common and specific components of DSM-IV personality disorders (PDs), and may offer a solution for the re-tooling of personality pathology in future versions of the DSM. In this paper, we examined the hierarchical structure of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, 2009) and the capacity of various trait components at different levels to predict DSM-IV PD symptoms. Participants were 275 psychiatric outpatients and 365 undergraduate students. Goldberg's (2006) bass-ackwards method was used to investigate the hierarchical structure of the DAPP-BQ. The predictive capacity of hierarchy components was assessed. We found that Level 5 of the hierarchy enhanced the capacity of the DAPP-BQ for predicting DSM PD symptoms beyond a four-factor structure, particularly for borderline PD.

TI Increased Psychopathology and Maladaptive Personality Traits, But Normal
   Cognitive Functioning, In Patients after Long-Term Cure of Acromegaly
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM
AB Objective: Active acromegaly is associated with psychopathology, personality changes, and cognitive dysfunction. It is unknown whether, and to what extent, these effects are present after long-term cure of acromegaly.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to assess psychopathology, personality traits, and cognitive function in patients after long-term cure of acromegaly.
   Design: This was a cross-sectional study.
   Patients and Methods: We studied 68 patients after long-term cure (13 +/- 1 yr) of acromegaly and 68 matched controls. We compared these data with 60 patients treated for nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenomas (NFMAs) and 60 matched controls. Psychopathology was assessed using the Apathy Scale, Irritability Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Mood and Anxiety Symptoms Questionnaire short-form, and personality was assessed by the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology short-form (DAPPs). Cognitive function was assessed by 11 tests.
   Results: Compared with matched controls, patients cured from acromegaly scored significantly worse on virtually all psychopathology questionnaires and on several subscales of the DAPPs. Compared with NFMA patients, patients cured from acromegaly scored worse on negative affect (P = 0.050) and somatic arousal (P = 0.009) and seven of 18 subscales of the DAPPs (P < 0.05). Cognitive function in patients cured from acromegaly did not differ from matched controls or patients treated for NFMA.
   Conclusion: Patients with long-term cure of acromegaly show a higher prevalence of psychopathology and maladaptive personality traits but not cognitive dysfunction, compared with matched controls and patients treated for NFMA. These results suggest irreversible effects of previous GH excess, rather than effects of pituitary adenomas per se and/or their treatment, on the central nervous system.

TI A Survey on Security and Privacy Issues of Bitcoin
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.

TI Sustainability of bitcoin and blockchains
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
AB Bitcoin is an electronic currency that has become increasingly popular since its introduction in 2008. Transactions in the bitcoin system are stored in a public transaction ledger ('the blockchain'), which is stored in a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. Bitcoin provides decentralized currency issuance and transaction clearance. The security of the blockchain depends on a compute-intensive algorithm for bitcoin mining, which prevents double spending of bitcoins and tampering with confirmed transactions. This 'proof-of-work' algorithm is energy demanding. How much energy is actually consumed, is subject of debate. We argue that this energy consumption currently is in the range of 100-500 MW. We discuss the developments in bitcoin mining hardware. We also briefly outline alternative schemes that are less energy demanding. We finally look at other blockchain applications, and argue that also here energy consumption is not of primary concern.

TI A Novel Blockchain-Based Product Ownership Management System (POMS) for
   Anti-Counterfeits in the Post Supply Chain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB For more than a decade now, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has been quite effective in providing anti-counterfeits measures in the supply chain. However, the genuineness of RFID tags cannot be guaranteed in the post supply chain, since these tags can be rather easily cloned in the public space. In this paper, we propose a novel product ownership management system (POMS) of RFID-attached products for anti-counterfeits that can be used in the post supply chain. For this purpose, we leverage the idea of Bitcoin's blockchain that anyone can check the proof of possession of balance. With the proposed POMS, a customer can reject the purchase of counterfeits even with genuine RFID tag information, if the seller does not possess their ownership. We have implemented a proof-of-concept experimental system employing a blockchain-based decentralized application platform, Ethereum, and evaluated its cost performance. Results have shown that, typically, the cost of managing the ownership of a product with up to six transfers is less than U.S. $1.

TI Blockchain and Its Coming Impact on Financial Services
SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB This article provides insight into how Blockchains work. A block chain or Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records that are hardened against tampering and revision, even by operators of the data store's nodes. One can view a Blockchain as a public ledger of all transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as completed blocks are added to previous blocks forming a chain. Importantly, blocks are added to the Blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each miner gets a copy of the Blockchain when joining the Bitcoin network. The Blockchain they receive has complete and accurate information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block.

AB The decentralized currency network Bitcoin is emerging as a potential new way of performing financial transactions across the globe. Its use of pseudonyms towards protecting users' privacy has been an attractive feature to many of its adopters. Nevertheless, due to the inherent public nature of the Bitcoin transaction ledger, users' privacy is severely restricted to linkable anonymity, and a few transaction deanonymization attacks have been reported thus far.
   In this paper we propose CoinShuffle, a completely decentralized Bitcoin mixing protocol that allows users to utilize Bitcoin in a truly anonymous manner. CoinShuffle is inspired by the accountable anonymous group communication protocol Dissent and enjoys several advantages over its predecessor Bitcoin mixing protocols. It does not require any (trusted, accountable or untrusted) third party and it is perfectly compatible with the current Bitcoin system. CoinShuffle introduces only a small communication overhead for its users, while completely avoiding additional anonymization fees and minimalizing the computation and communication overhead for the rest of the Bitcoin system.

TI Bitcoin's Growing Energy Problem
SO JOULE
AB The electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.

   technology
SO SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
AB Despite an increased focus on the security of electronic health records and an effort by large cities around the globe to pursue smart city infrastructure, the private information of patients is subject to data breaches on a regular basis. Previous efforts to combat this have resulted in data being mostly inaccessible to patients. Existing record management systems struggle with balancing data privacy and the need for patients and providers to regularly interact with data. Blockchain technology is an emerging technology that enables data sharing in a decentralized and transactional fashion. Blockchain technology can be leveraged in the healthcare domain to achieve the delicate balance between privacy and accessibility of electronic health records.
   In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for secure, interoperable, and efficient access to medical records by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the privacy of patients' sensitive information. Our framework, named Ancile, utilizes smart contracts in an Ethereum-based blockchain for heightened access control and obfuscation of data, and employs advanced cryptographic techniques for further security. The goals of this paper are to analyze how Ancile would interact with the different needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework could address longstanding privacy and security concerns in the healthcare industry.

TI Cryptocurrency value formation: An empirical study leading to a cost of
   production model for valuing bitcoin
SO TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB This paper aims to identify the likely determinants for cryptocurrency value formation, including for that of bitcoin. Due to Bitcoin's growing popular appeal and merchant acceptance, it has become increasingly important to try to understand the factors that influence its value formation. Presently, the value of all bitcoins in existence represent approximately $7 billion, and more than $60 million of notional value changes hands each day. Having grown rapidly over the past few years, there is now a developing but vibrant marketplace for bitcoin, and a recognition of digital currencies as an emerging asset class. Not only is there a listed and over-the-counter market for bitcoin and other digital currencies, but also an emergent derivatives market. As such, the ability to value bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies is becoming critical to its establishment as a legitimate financial asset.
   Using cross-sectional empirical data examining 66 of the most widely used cryptocurrencies, a regression model was estimated that points to three main drivers of cryptocurrency value: the level of competition in the network of producers, the rate of unit production, and the difficulty of algorithm used to "mine" for the cryptocurrency. These amount to relative differences in the cost of production of one digital currency over another at the margin, pointing to differences in relative cost of production electricity goes in, cryptocurrency comes out. Using that as a starting point, a no-arbitrage situation is established for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies followed by the formalization of a cost of production model to determine the fair value of a bitcoin.

TI Trusting records: is Blockchain technology the answer?
SO RECORDS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the value of Blockchain technology as a solution to creating and preserving trustworthy digital records, presenting some of the limitations, risks and opportunities of the approach.
   Design/methodology/approach - The methodological approach involves using the requirements embedded in records management and digital preservation standards, specifically ISO 15,489, ARMA's Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles, ISO 14,721 and ISO 16,363, as a general evaluative framework for a risk-based assessment of a specific proposed implementation of Blockchain technology for a land registry system in a developing country.
   Findings - The results of the analysis suggest that Blockchain technology can be used to address issues associated with information integrity in the present and near term, assuming proper security architecture and infrastructure management controls. It does not, however, guarantee reliability of information in the first place, and would have several limitations as a long-term solution for maintaining trustworthy digital records.
   Originality/value - This paper contributes an original analysis of the application of Blockchain technology for recordkeeping.

TI Privacy-Preserving and Efficient Aggregation Based on Blockchain for
   Power Grid Communications in Smart Communities
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Intelligence is one of the most important aspects in the development of our future communities. Ranging from smart home to smart building to smart city, all these smart infrastructures must be supported by intelligent power supply. Smart grid is proposed to solve all challenges of future electricity supply. In smart grid, in order to realize optimal scheduling, an SM is installed at each home to collect the near-real-time electricity consumption data, which can be used by the utilities to offer better smart home services. However, the near-real-time data may disclose a user's private information. An adversary may track the application usage patterns by analyzing the user's electricity consumption profile. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and efficient data aggregation scheme. We divide users into different groups, and each group has a private block-chain to record its members' data. To preserve the inner privacy within a group, we use pseudonyms to hide users' identities, and each user may create multiple pseudonyms and associate his/her data with different pseudonyms. In addition, the bloom filter is adopted for fast authentication. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme can meet the security requirements and achieve better performance than other popular methods.

TI Secure Attribute-Based Signature Scheme With Multiple Authorities for
   Blockchain in Electronic Health Records Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are entirely controlled by hospitals instead of patients, which complicates seeking medical advices from different hospitals. Patients face a critical need to focus on the details of their own healthcare and restore management of their own medical data. The rapid development of blockchain technology promotes population healthcare, including medical records as well as patient-related data. This technology provides patients with comprehensive, immutable records, and access to EHRs free from service providers and treatment websites. In this paper, to guarantee the validity of EHRs encapsulated in blockchain, we present an attribute-based signature scheme with multiple authorities, in which a patient endorses a message according to the attribute while disclosing no information other than the evidence that he has attested to it. Furthermore, there are multiple authorities without a trusted single or central one to generate and distribute public/private keys of the patient, which avoids the escrow problem and conforms to the mode of distributed data storage in the blockchain. By sharing the secret pseudorandom function seeds among authorities, this protocol resists collusion attack out of N from N - 1 corrupted authorities. Under the assumption of the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman, we also formally demonstrate that, in terms of the unforgeability and perfect privacy of the attribute-signer, this attribute-based signature scheme is secure in the random oracle model. The comparison shows the efficiency and properties between the proposed method and methods proposed in other studies.

However, few studies in the literature have examined the price dynamics of Bitcoin. Besides providing an exploratory glace at the value and volatility of the Bitcoin across time, we also test whether the unusual level of Bitcoin's volatility is attributable to speculative trading. Results in this study do not find that, during 2013, speculative trading contributed to the unprecedented rise and subsequent crash in Bitcoin's value nor do we find that speculative trading is directly associated with Bitcoin's unusual level of volatility.

TI Blockchain based efficient and robust fair payment for outsourcing
   services in cloud computing
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB As an attractive business model of cloud computing, outsourcing services usually involve online payment and security issues. The mutual distrust between users and outsourcing service providers may severely impede the wide adoption of cloud computing. Nevertheless, most existing payment solutions only consider a specific type of outsourcing service and rely on a trusted third-party to realize fairness.
   In this paper, in order to realize secure and fair payment of outsourcing services in general without relying on any third-party, trusted or not, we introduce BCPay, a blockchain based fair payment framework for outsourcing services in cloud computing. We first present the system architecture, specifications and adversary model of BCPay, then describe in detail its design. Our security analysis indicates that BCPay achieves Soundness and what we call Robust Fairness, where the fairness is resilient to eavesdropping and malleability attacks. Furthermore, our performance evaluation shows that BCPay is very efficient in terms of the number of transactions and computation cost. As illustrative applications of BCPay, we further construct a blockchain-based provable data possession scheme in cloud computing and a blockchain-based outsourcing computation protocol in fog computing.

We apply time-series analytical mechanisms to daily data of 17 virtual currencies (BitCoin + 16 alternative virtual currencies) and two altcoin price indices for the period 2013-2016. Our empirical findings confirm that indeed BitCoin and altcoin markets are interdependent. The BitCoin-altcoin price relationship is significantly stronger in the short-run than in the long-run. We cannot fully confirm the hypothesis that the BitCoin price relationship is stronger with those altcoins that are more similar in their price formation mechanism to BitCoin. In the long-run, macro-financial indicators determine the altcoin price formation to a slightly greater degree than BitCoin does. The virtual currency supply is exogenous and therefore plays only a limited role in the price formation. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB While blockchain technology is commonly considered potentially disruptive in various regards, there is a lack of understanding where and how blockchain technology is effectively applicable and where it has mentionable practical effects. This issue has given rise to critical voices that judge the technology as over-hyped. Against this backdrop, this study adapts an established research framework to structure the insights of the current body of research on blockchain technology, outline the present research scope as well as disregarded topics, and sketch out multidisciplinary research approaches. The framework differentiates three groups of activities (design and features, measurement and value, management and organization) at four levels of analysis (users and society, intermediaries, platforms, firms and industry). The review shows that research has predominantly focused on technological questions of design and features, while neglecting application, value creation, and governance. In order to foster substantial blockchain research that addresses meaningful questions, this study identifies several avenues for future studies. Given the breadth of open questions, it shows where research can benefit from multidisciplinary collaborations and presents data sources as starting points for empirical investigations.

TI Blockchain technology for improving clinical research quality
SO TRIALS
AB Reproducibility, data sharing, personal data privacy concerns and patient enrolment in clinical trials are huge medical challenges for contemporary clinical research. A new technology, Blockchain, may be a key to addressing these challenges and should draw the attention of the whole clinical research community. Blockchain brings the Internet to its definitive decentralisation goal. The core principle of Blockchain is that any service relying on trusted third parties can be built in a transparent, decentralised, secure "trustless" manner at the top of the Blockchain (in fact, there is trust, but it is hardcoded in the Blockchain protocol via a complex cryptographic algorithm). Therefore, users have a high degree of control over and autonomy and trust of the data and its integrity. Blockchain allows for reaching a substantial level of historicity and inviolability of data for the whole document flow in a clinical trial. Hence, it ensures traceability, prevents a posteriori reconstruction and allows for securely automating the clinical trial through what are called Smart Contracts. At the same time, the technology ensures fine-grained control of the data, its security and its shareable parameters, for a single patient or group of patients or clinical trial stakeholders. In this commentary article, we explore the core functionalities of Blockchain applied to clinical trials and we illustrate concretely its general principle in the context of consent to a trial protocol. Trying to figure out the potential impact of Blockchain implementations in the setting of clinical trials will shed new light on how modern clinical trial methods could evolve and benefit from Blockchain technologies in order to tackle the aforementioned challenges.

AB Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting-anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents "sybil attacks" (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. "moderately hard functions") introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto'92).
   The analysis of the blockchain consensus protocol (a.k.a. Nakamoto consensus) has been a notoriously difficult task. Prior works that analyze it either make the simplifying assumption that network channels are fully synchronous (i.e. messages are instantly delivered without delays) (Garay et al. Eurocrypt'15) or only consider specific attacks (Nakamoto'08; Sampolinsky and Zohar, FinancialCrypt'15); additionally, as far as we know, none of them deal with players joining or leaving the protocol.
   In this work we prove that the blockchain consensus mechanism satisfies a strong forms of consistency and liveness in an asynchronous network with adversarial delays that are a-priori bounded, within a formal model allowing for adaptive corruption and spawning of new players, assuming that the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. (We complement this result by showing a simple attack against the blockchain protocol in a fully asynchronous setting, showing that the "puzzle-hardness" needs to be appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay; this attack applies even for static corruption.)
   As an independent contribution, we define an abstract blockchain protocol and identify appropriate security properties of such protocols; we prove that Nakamoto's blockchain protocol satisfies them and that these properties are sufficient for typical applications; we hope that this abstraction may simplify further applications of blockchains.

AB Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the more recent Ethereum system allow users to specify scripts in transactions and contracts to support applications beyond simple cash transactions. In this work, we analyze the extent to which these systems can enforce the correct semantics of scripts. We show that when a script execution requires nontrivial computation effort, practical attacks exist which either waste miners' computational resources or lead miners to accept incorrect script results. These attacks drive miners to an illfated choice, which we call the verifier's dilemma, whereby rational miners are well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains. We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and develop a model that captures incentives for verifying computation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain applications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify. Finally we discuss two distinct, practical implementations of our consensus computer in real cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum.

We study four popular protocols that make use of this type of public-key cryptography: Bitcoin, secure shell (SSH), transport layer security (TLS), and the Austrian e-ID card. We are pleased to observe that about 1 in 10 systems support ECC across the TLS and SSH protocols. However, we find that despite the high stakes of money, access and resources protected by ECC, implementations suffer from vulnerabilities similar to those that plague previous cryptographic systems.

TI Blockchain technology and its relationships to sustainable supply chain
   management
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Globalisation of supply chains makes their management and control more difficult. Blockchain technology, as a distributed digital ledger technology which ensures transparency, traceability, and security, is showing promise for easing some global supply chain management problems. In this paper, blockchain technology and smart contracts are critically examined with potential application to supply chain management. Local and global government, community, and consumer pressures to meet sustainability goals prompt us to further investigate how blockchain can address and aid supply chain sustainability. Part of this critical examination is how blockchains, a potentially disruptive technology that is early in its evolution, can overcome many potential barriers. Four blockchain technology adoption barriers categories are introduced; inter-organisational, intra-organisational, technical, and external barriers. True blockchain-led transformation of business and supply chain is still in progress and in its early stages; we propose future research propositions and directions that can provide insights into overcoming barriers and adoption of blockchain technology for supply chain management.

AB Blockchain technology offers a sizable promise to rethink the way interorganizational business processes are managed because of its potential to realize execution without a central party serving as a single point of trust (and failure). To stimulate research on this promise and the limits thereof, in this article, we outline the challenges and opportunities of blockchain for business process management (BPM). We first reflect how blockchains could be used in the context of the established BPM lifecycle and second how they might become relevant beyond. We conclude our discourse with a summary of seven research directions for investigating the application of blockchain technology in the context of BPM.

TI Chaos, randomness and multi-fractality in Bitcoin market
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Since its inception, the digital currency market is considerably growing, especially in the most recent years. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate, assess and detect chaos, randomness, and multi-scale temporal correlation structure in prices and returns of this specific virtual and speculative market throughout two distinct time periods; namely under a low-level regime period during which prices slowly increased, and during a high and turbulent regime time period whereby they exponentially increased. We found that chaos is only present in prices during both periods, whilst the level of uncertainty in returns has significantly increased during the high-price time period. Furthermore, both prices and returns exhibit long-range correlations and multi-fractality. The fat-tailed probability distributions are the main source of multi-fractality in the time series of prices and returns. Finally, short (long) fluctuations in returns are dominant during low (high) price-regime time period, respectively. Overall, the high-price regime phase has profoundly revealed consistent nonlinear dynamical patterns in the Bitcoin market. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present an architecture for peer-to-peer energy markets which can guarantee that operational constraints are respected and payments are fairly rendered, without relying on a centralized utility or microgrid aggregator. We demonstrate how to address trust, security, and transparency issues by using blockchains and smart contracts, two emerging technologies which can facilitate decentralized coordination between nontrusting agents. While blockchains are receiving considerable interest as a platform for distributed computation and data management, this is the first work to examine their use to facilitate distributed optimization and control. Using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), we pose a decentralized optimal power flow (OPF) model for scheduling a mix of batteries, shapable loads, and deferrable loads on an electricity distribution network. The DERs perform local optimization steps, and a smart contract on the blockchain serves as the ADMM coordinator, allowing the validity and optimality of the solution to be verified. The optimal schedule is securely stored on the blockchain, and payments can be automatically, securely, and trustlessly rendered without requiring a microgrid operator.

TI Cu2+ Binds to Phosphatidylethanolamine and Increases Oxidation in Lipid
   Membranes
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Herein, we demonstrate that Cu2+ binds bivalently to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the second most abundant lipid in mammalian cells. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, K-DApp, for the Cu2+-PE complex at physiological pH is approximately 2 mu M and is insensitive to the concentration of PE in the membrane. By contrast, at pH 10.0, where PE lipids bear a negative charge, K-DApp decreases with increasing PE content and has a value of 150 nM for bilayers containing 70 mol % PE. The oxidation of double bonds in PE-containing bilayers can, be monitored in the presence of Cu2+. Strikingly, it was found that the oxidation rate is 8.2 times faster at pH 7.4 for bilayers containing 70 mol % PE than for pure phosphatidylcholine (PC) bilayers upon exposure of both to 70 mu M Cu2+ and 10 mM hydrogen peroxide. The rate of oxidation increases linearly with the PE content in the membrane. These results may help explain the high level of lipid oxidation in PE-containing membranes for neurodegenerative diseases and autism where the Cu2+ concentration in the body is abnormally high.

AB One of the unique features of the digital currency Bitcoin is that new cash is introduced by so-called miners carrying out resource-intensive proof-of-work operations. To increase their chances of obtaining freshly minted bitcoins, miners typically join pools to collaborate on the computations. However, intense competition among mining pools has recently manifested in two ways. Miners may invest in additional computing resources to increase the likelihood of winning the next mining race. But, at times, a more sinister tactic is also employed: a mining pool may trigger a costly distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack to lower the expected success outlook of a competing mining pool. We explore the trade-off between these strategies with a series of game-theoretical models of competition between two pools of varying sizes. We consider differences in costs of investment and attack, as well as uncertainty over whether a DDoS attack will succeed. By characterizing the game's equilibria, we can draw a number of conclusions. In particular, we find that pools have a greater incentive to attack large pools than small ones. We also observe that larger mining pools have a greater incentive to attack than smaller ones.

Therefore, because of this full autonomy, these entities need to recognize and authenticate each other as well as to ensure the integrity of their exchanged data. Otherwise, they will be the target of malicious users and malicious use. Due to the size and other features of IoT, it is almost impossible to create an efficient centralized authentication system. To remedy this limit, in this paper, we propose an original decentralized system called bubbles of trust, which ensures a robust identification and authentication of devices. Furthermore, it protects the data integrity and availability. To achieve such a goal, our approach relies on the security advantages provided by blockchains, and serves to create secure virtual zones (bubbles) where things can identify and trust each other. We also provided a real implementation of our mechanism using the C++ language and Ethereum blockchain. The obtained results prove its ability to satisfy loT security requirements, its efficiency, and its low cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI When Mobile Blockchain Meets Edge Computing
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Blockchain, as the backbone technology of the current popular Bitcoin digital currency, has become a promising decentralized data management framework. Although blockchain has been widely adopted in many applications (e.g., finance, healthcare, and logistics), its application in mobile services is still limited. This is due to the fact that blockchain users need to solve preset proof-of-work puzzles to add new data (i.e., a block) to the blockchain. Solving the proof of work, however, consumes substantial resources in terms of CPU time and energy, which is not suitable for resource-limited mobile devices. To facilitate blockchain applications in future mobile Internet of Things systems, multiple access mobile edge computing appears to be an auspicious solution to solve the proof-of-work puzzles for mobile users. We first introduce a novel concept of edge computing for mobile blockchain. Then we introduce an economic approach for edge computing resource management. Moreover, a prototype of mobile edge computing enabled blockchain systems is presented with experimental results to justify the proposed concept.

TI Incorporating seller/buyer reputation-based system in blockchain-enabled
   emission trading application
SO APPLIED ENERGY
AB Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) has dual aims to reduce emission production and stimulate adoption of long term abatement technology. Whilst it has generally achieved its first aim, its issues are hindering the accomplishment of the second. Several solutions have been proposed to improve ETS's efficacy, yet none of them have considered the advancement of Industry 4.0. This paper proposes a novel ETS model customised for Industry 4.0 integration. It incorporates blockchain technology to address ETS's management and fraud issues whilst it utilizes a reputation system in a new approach to improve ETS efficacy. Specific design of how the blockchain technology and reputation system are used to achieve these objectives is showed within this paper. The case study demonstrates the inner working of reputation-based trading system in which reputation signifies participants performance and commitment toward emission reduction effort. Multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the proposed scheme against conventional ETS model. The result shows that the proposed model is a feasible scheme and that the benefits of its implementation will outweigh its drawback.

TI Bitcoin for energy commodities before and after the December 2013 crash:
   diversifier, hedge or safe haven?
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB We study the relationship between Bitcoin and commodities by assessing the ability of Bitcoin to act as a diversifier, hedge, or safe haven against daily movements in commodities in general, and energy commodities in particular. We focus on energy commodities because energy, in the form of electricity, is an essential input in the Bitcoin production. For the entire period, results show that Bitcoin is a strong hedge and a safe-haven against movements in both commodity indices. We further examine whether that ability is also present for non-energy commodities and our analysis show insignificant results when energy commodities are excluded from the general commodity index. We also account for the December 2013 Bitcoin price crash and our results reveal that Bitcoin hedge and safe-haven properties against commodities and energy commodities are only present in the pre-crash period, whereas in the post-crash period Bitcoin is no more than a diversifier. In addition to uncovering the time-varying role of Bitcoin, we highlight the dissimilarity in the dynamic correlations between the extreme downward and extreme upward movements.

TI HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE OF MALADAPTIVE PERSONALITY TRAITS IN OLDER
   ADULTS: JOINT FACTOR ANALYSIS OF THE PID-5 AND THE DAPP-BQ
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS
AB In DSM-5, the categorical model and criteria for the 10 personality disorders included in DSM-IV will be reprinted in Section II. Moreover, an alternative dimensional classification model will appear in Section III. This alternative DSM-5 proposal for the diagnosis of a personality disorder is based on two fundamental criteria impairments in personality functioning (Criterion A) and the presence of pathological personality traits (Criterion B). In the maladaptive trait model that has been developed to operationalize Criterion B, 25 pathological traits are organized according to five higher order dimensions. The current study focuses on the convergence of the proposed DSM-5 trait model (as measured by the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 [PID-5]) with the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP) model (as measured by the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire [DAPP-BQ]) in a sample of older people. A joint hierarchical factor analysis showed clear convergence between four PID-5 dimensions (Negative Affect, Detachment, Antagonism, Disinhibition) and conceptually similar DAPP-BQ components. Moreover, the PID-5 and the DAPP-BQ showed meaningful associations on different levels of their joint hierarchical factor structure. Methodological and theoretical implications of these initial results for the conceptualization of personality pathology are discussed.

TI Impact on molecular organization of amylopectin in starch granules upon
   annealing
SO CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
AB This study investigated the influence of the internal structure of amylopectin on annealing (3 h, 24 h) of starches from four different types of amylopectin (Bertoft, Koch, & Aman, 2012; Bertoft, Piyachomkwan, Chatakanonda, & Sriroth, 2008). Regardless of the starch source and incubation time, annealing significantly increased the onset gelatinization temperature (To) and narrowed and deepened the amylopectin endotherm. However, the extent of the change in the melting temperature (Tm) and the enthalpy of gelatinization (Delta H) differed among the types. In terms of the To and Tm, starches from type I (oat, rye, barley, and waxy barley) showed the most significant response to annealing. The Tm of starches belonging to type 2 (waxy maize, rice, waxy rice, and sago) remained unchanged after 3 h of annealing. Type 1 and type 2 starches with the lowest gelatinization temperatures showed the greatest increase in melting temperature after annealing. However, type 3 (tapioca, mung bean, and arrowroot) and type 4 (potato, waxy potato, canna, and yam) starches were not in line with these observations. Instead, starches from type 3 and type 4 showed a pronounced increase in the Delta H. The inter-block chain length (IB-CL) (distance between tightly branched units within a cluster) correlated positively (r =0.93, p < 0.01) with the change in enthalpy after 24 h of annealing. These data indicate that a short IB-CL affects the optimum registration of double helices within the crystalline lamellae. The relationship between the gelatinization parameters before and after annealing suggests that type 1 and 2 starches might possess a high number of unpacked double helices (type 1 > type 2) compared to other types. Longer IB-CLs, which facilitate the parallel packing of splayed double helices, and the lengthening of double helices likely increased the Delta H in type 3 and type 4 starches. It is concluded that annealing can be used as a probe for visualizing the organization of glucan chains (alignment of double helices/degree of perfection) within crystalline lamellae.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the promising technologies that has attracted a lot of attention in both industrial and academic fields these years. It aims to integrate seamlessly both physical and digital worlds in one single ecosystem that makes up a new intelligent era of Internet. This technology offers a huge business value for organizations and provides opportunities for many existing applications such as energy, healthcare and other sectors. However, as new emergent technology, IoT suffers from several security issues which are most challenging than those from other fields regarding its complex environment and resources-constrained IoT devices. A lot of researches have been initiated in order to provide efficient security solutions in IoT, particularly to address resources constraints and scalability issues. Furthermore, some technologies related to networking and cryptocurrency fields such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain are, revolutionizing the world of the Internet of Things thanks to their efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive top down survey of the most recent proposed security and privacy solutions in IoT. We discuss particularly the benefits that new approaches such as blockchain and Software Defined Networking can bring to the security and the privacy in IoT in terms of flexibility and scalability. Finally, we give a general classification of existing solutions and comparison based on important parameters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain and IoT Integration: A Systematic Survey
SO SENSORS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of smart devices to collect data and make intelligent decisions. However, a lack of intrinsic security measures makes IoT vulnerable to privacy and security threats. With its "security by design," Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.

TI CONTRACTS EX MACHINA
SO DUKE LAW JOURNAL
AB Smart contracts are self-executing digital transactions using decentralized cryptographic mechanisms for enforcement. They were theorized more than twenty years ago, but the recent development of Bitcoin and blockchain technologies has rekindled excitement about their potential among technologists and industry. Startup companies and major enterprises alike are now developing smart contract solutions for an array of markets, purporting to offer a digital bypass around traditional contract law. For legal scholars, smart contracts pose a significant question: Do smart contracts offer a superior solution to the problems that contract law addresses? In this article, we aim to understand both the potential and the limitations of smart contracts. We conclude that smart contracts offer novel possibilities, may significantly alter the commercial world, and will demand new legal responses. But smart contracts will not displace contract law. Understanding why not brings into focus the essential role of contract law as a remedial institution. In this way, smart contracts actually illuminate the role of contract law more than they obviate it.

AB Access Control systems are used in computer security to regulate the access to critical or valuable resources. The rights of subjects to access such resources are typically expressed through access control policies, which are evaluated at access request time against the current access context. This paper proposes a new approach based on blockchain technology to publish the policies expressing the right to access a resource and to allow the distributed transfer of such right among users. In our proposed protocol the policies and the rights exchanges are publicly visible on the blockchain, consequently any user can know at any time the policy paired with a resource and the subjects who currently have the rights to access the resource. This solution allows distributed auditability, preventing a party from fraudulently denying the rights granted by an enforceable policy. We also show a possible working implementation based on XACML policies, deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Our findings reveal the extremely speculative behavior of Bitcoin, its partial usefulness in trade transactions without overlooking its dependence to the Shangai stock market and the hash rate. There is no sign of Bitcoin being a safe haven Taking a step further, we re-investigate the focal link by accounting for the Chinese trading bankruptcy. The results appear fairly robust. Bitcoin is still perceived as speculative foolery and thus far from being a long-term promise.

TI Evaluation of Diels-Alder poly( phenylene) anion exchange membranes in
   all-vanadium redox flow batteries
SO ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS
AB Quaternary ammonium functionalized Diels-Alder poly(phenylene)s (QDAPPs) with different ion exchange capacities (IECs) are examined as membranes in all-vanadium redox flow batteries. QDAPP membrane behavior is compared to a standard, Nafion 212, in measurements of cycling efficiencies, areal specific resistance (ASR), vanadium permeation and durability. The IEC of the QDAPPs clearly shows an impact on the cell ASR and vanadium crossover. The results imply a trade-off between performance, indicated by cell voltage loss at a given current density, and rate of cross-over driven capacity loss in the system. Among the membranes studied, QDAPP with moderate IEC represents the best trade-off of these factors and exhibits higher performance and lower capacity loss compared to Nafion 212. All QDAPP membranes are found to be more durable than the analogous cation exchange membrane, sulfonated DAPP (SDAPP), in V5+ solution. Published by Elsevier B.V

AB We show how the Bitcoin currency system (with a small modification) can be used to obtain fairness in any two-party secure computation protocol in the following sense: if one party aborts the protocol after learning the output then the other party gets a financial compensation (in bitcoins). One possible application of such protocols is the fair contract signing: each party is forced to complete the protocol, or to pay to the other one a fine.
   We also show how to link the output of this protocol to the Bitcoin currency. More precisely: we show a method to design secure two-party protocols for functionalities that result in a "forced" financial transfer from one party to the other.
   Our protocols build upon the ideas of our recent paper "Secure Multiparty Computations on Bitcoin" (Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2013/784). Compared to that paper, our results are more general, since our protocols allow to compute any function, while in the previous paper we concentrated only on some specific tasks (commitment schemes and lotteries). On the other hand, as opposed to "Secure Multiparty Computations on Bitcoin", to obtain security we need to modify the Bitcoin specification so that the transactions are "non-malleable" (we discuss this concept in more detail in the paper).

AB In Bitcoin, transaction malleability describes the fact that the signatures that prove the ownership of bitcoins being transferred in a transaction do not provide any integrity guarantee for the signatures themselves. This allows an attacker to mount a malleability attack in which it intercepts, modifies, and rebroadcasts a transaction, causing the transaction issuer to believe that the original transaction was not confirmed. In February 2014 MtGox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange, closed and filed for bankruptcy claiming that attackers used malleability attacks to drain its accounts. In this work we use traces of the Bitcoin network for over a year preceding the filing to show that, while the problem is real, there was no widespread use of malleability attacks before the closure of MtGox.

TI Locational signals to reduce network investments in smart distribution
   grids: What works and what not?
SO UTILITIES POLICY
AB Locational pricing can reduce the investment needs arising in distribution networks from the transformation towards smart grids with high shares of renewable generation. We analyse different approaches. Locational signals in a general tariff plan for either energy or network pricing require substantial system reform which impedes feasibility. We propose smart contracts with locational elements as hybrid form. System reform is only modest since contractual solutions emerge in smart grids anyhow. The responsibility for tariff setting stays with the network operator. The regulator's task is limited to incentivizing efficient network investment and allowing network operators maximum flexibility in contract design. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A blockchain future for internet of things security: a position paper
SO DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly being found in civilian and military contexts, ranging from smart cities and smart grids to Internet-of-Medical-Things, Internet-of-Vehicles, Internet-of-Military-Things, Internet-of-Battlefield-Things, etc. In this paper, we survey articles presenting IoT security solutions published in English since January 2016. We make a number of observations, including the lack of publicly available IoT datasets that can be used by the research and practitioner communities. Given the potentially sensitive nature of IoT datasets, there is a need to develop a standard for sharing IoT datasets among the research and practitioner communities and other relevant stakeholders. Thus, we posit the potential for blockchain technology in facilitating secure sharing of IoT datasets (e.g., using blockchain to ensure the integrity of shared datasets) and securing IoT systems, before presenting two conceptual blockchain-based approaches. We then conclude this paper with nine potential research questions.

TI The limits of trust-free systems: A literature review on blockchain
   technology and trust in the sharing economy
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB At the tip of the hype cycle, trust-free systems based on blockchain technology promise to revolutionize interactions between peers that require high degrees of trust, usually facilitated by third party providers. Peer-to-peer platforms for resource sharing represent a frequently discussed field of application for "trust-free" blockchain technology. However, trust between peers plays a crucial and complex role in virtually all sharing economy interactions. In this article, we hence shed light on how these conflicting notions may be resolved and explore the potential of blockchain technology for dissolving the issue of trust in the sharing economy. By means of a dual literature review we find that 1) the conceptualization of trust differs substantially between the contexts of blockchain and the sharing economy, 2) blockchain technology is to some degree suitable to replace trust in platform providers, and that 3) trust-free systems are hardly transferable to sharing economy interactions and will crucially depend on the development of trusted interfaces for blockchain-based sharing economy ecosystems.

TI A Survey about Consensus Algorithms Used in Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB Thanks to its potential in many applications, Blockchain has recently been nominated as one of the technologies exciting intense attention. Blockchain has solved the problem of changing the original low-trust centralized ledger held by a single third-party, to a high-trust decentralized form held by different entities, or in other words, verifying nodes. The key contribution of the work of Blockchain is the consensus algorithm, which decides how agreement is made to append a new block between all nodes in the verifying network. Blockchain algorithms can be categorized into two main groups. The first group is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the verifying network to show that they are more qualified than the others to do the appending work. The second group is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the network to exchange their results of verifying a new block or transaction, before making the final decision. In this paper, we present a review of the Blockchain consensus algorithms that have been researched and that are being applied in some well-known applications at this time.

TI Toward an ontology-driven blockchain design for supply-chain provenance
SO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN ACCOUNTING FINANCE & MANAGEMENT
AB An interesting research problem in our age of Big Data is that of determining provenance. Granular evaluation of provenance of physical goods (e.g., tracking ingredients of a pharmaceutical or demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods) has often not been possible with today's items that are produced and transported in complex, interorganizational, often internationally spanning supply chains. Recent adoptions of the Internet of Things and blockchain technologies give promise at better supply-chain provenance. We are particularly interested in the blockchain, as many favored use cases of blockchain are for provenance tracking. We are also interested in applying ontologies, as there has been some work done on knowledge provenance, traceability, and food provenance using ontologies. In this paper, we make a case for why ontologies can contribute to blockchain design. To support this case, we analyze a traceability ontology and translate some of its representations to smart contracts that execute a provenance trace and enforce traceability constraints on the Ethereum blockchain platform.

AB It is a challenge to ensure data integrity for cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications because of the inherently dynamic nature of IoT data. The available frameworks of data integrity verification with public auditability cannot avoid the Third Party Auditors (TPAs). However, in a dynamic environment, such as the IoT, the reliability of the TPA-based frameworks is far from being satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for Data Integrity Service. Under such framework, a more reliable data integrity verification can be provided for both the Data Owners and the Data Consumers, without relying on any Third Party Auditor (TPA). In this paper, the relevant protocols and a subsequent prototype system, which is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals, are presented. The performance evaluation of the implemented prototype system is conducted, and the test results are discussed. The work lays a foundation for our future work on dynamic data integrity verification in a fully decentralized environment.

AB Bitcoin provides two incentives for miners: block rewards and transaction fees. The former accounts for the vast majority of miner revenues at the beginning of the system, but it is expected to transition to the latter as the block rewards dwindle. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the block chain.
   We show that this is not the case. Our key insight is that with only transaction fees, the variance of the block reward is very high due to the exponentially distributed block arrival time, and it becomes attractive to fork a "wealthy" block to "steal" the rewards therein. We show that this results in an equilibrium with undesirable properties for Bitcoin's security and performance, and even non-equilibria in some circumstances. We also revisit selfish mining and show that it can be made profitable for a miner with an arbitrarily low hash power share, and who is arbitrarily poorly connected within the network. Our results are derived from theoretical analysis and confirmed by a new Bitcoin mining simulator that may be of independent interest.
   We discuss the troubling implications of our results for Bitcoin's future security and draw lessons for the design of new cryptocurrencies.

TI Internet content regulation, public drug websites and the growth in
   hidden Internet services
SO DRUGS-EDUCATION PREVENTION AND POLICY
AB Governments have traditionally censored drug-related information, both in traditional media and, in recent years, in online media. We explore Internet content regulation from a drug-policy perspective by describing the likely impacts of censoring drug websites and the parallel growth in hidden Internet services. Australia proposes a compulsory Internet filtering regime that would block websites that 'depict, express or otherwise deal with matters of ... drug misuse or addiction' and/or 'promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime'. In this article, we present findings from a mixed-methods study of online drug discussion. Our research found that websites dealing with drugs, that would likely be blocked by the filter, in fact contributed positively to harm reduction. Such sites helped people access more comprehensive and relevant information than was available elsewhere. Blocking these websites would likely drive drug discussion underground at a time when corporate-controlled 'walled gardens' (e. g. Facebook) and proprietary operating systems on mobile devices may also limit open drug discussion. At the same time, hidden Internet services, such as Silk Road, have emerged that are not affected by Internet filtering. The inability for any government to regulate Tor websites and the crypto-currency Bitcoin poses a unique challenge to drug prohibition policies.

TI Symmetry breaking and light-induced spin-state trapping in a mononuclear
   Fe-II complex with the two-step thermal conversion
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
AB Crystallographic, magnetic, and Raman investigations of the mononuclear [Fe-II(Hpy-DAPP)](BF4)(2) complex are presented. Its particular feature is a two-step thermal spin conversion in spite of a unique symmetry-independent iron site per unit cell. The plateau around 140 K is associated with a symmetry breaking visible by the appearance of weak (0k0) k odd Bragg peaks. Symmetries of the high-temperature high-spin state and of the low-temperature low-spin state are both monoclinic P2(1)/c, so that the symmetry breaking on the plateau is associated with a reentrant phase transition. It is discussed in relation with Ising-type microscopic models. At the plateau level, the two symmetry-independent molecules differ both by their spin state and the conformation (chair versus twist-boat) of one metallocycle. At low-temperature photoinduced phenomena have been investigated: a partial phototransformation [light-induced excited spin-state trapping (LIESST) effect] is observed under visible red irradiation. Raman spectroscopy shows that the molecular photoinduced state is the high-spin one. Nevertheless, as no macroscopic symmetry breaking is observed, the unique average cationic [Fe-II(Hpy-DAPP)] state of the unit cell is intermediate between pure low-spin and high-spin states and presents a conformational disorder for one metallocycle. Reverse-LIESST has also been evidenced using near infrared excitation. Thus, the mononuclear [Fe(Hpy-DAPP)](BF4)(2) compound offers the opportunity to discuss the interplay between spin conversion, molecular conformational change, and ordering processes.

TI OmniPHR: A distributed architecture model to integrate personal health
   records
SO JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB The advances in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) brought many benefits to the healthcare area, specially to digital storage of patients' health records. However, it is still a challenge to have a unified viewpoint of patients' health history, because typically health data is scattered among different health organizations. Furthermore, there are several standards for these records, some of them open and others proprietary. Usually health records are stored in databases within health organizations and rarely have external access. This situation applies mainly to cases where patients' data are maintained by healthcare providers, known as EHRs (Electronic Health Records). In case of PHRs (Personal Health Records), in which patients by definition can manage their health records, they usually have no control over their data stored in healthcare providers' databases. Thereby, we envision two main challenges regarding PHR context: first, how patients could have a unified view of their scattered health records, and second, how healthcare providers can access up-to-date data regarding their patients, even though changes occurred elsewhere. For addressing these issues, this work proposes a model named OmniPHR, a distributed model to integrate PHRs, for patients and healthcare providers use. The scientific contribution is to propose an architecture model to support a distributed PHR, where patients can maintain their health history in an unified viewpoint, from any device anywhere. Likewise, for healthcare providers, the possibility of having their patients data interconnected among health organizations. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the model in maintaining health records distributed in an architecture model that promotes a unified view of PHR with elasticity and scalability of the solution.

These differences must due to the identical nature of all bitcoin-result from characteristics of markets themselves. We examine differences across the markets and find that those which do not require customer identification for establishing an account are more likely to deviate from representative market prices than those which do, but we cannot identify an element to predict the timing or the size of the deviation. This implies that standard financial regulations, specifically know your-customer regulations, can have a non-negligible impact on the market for Bitcoin. This finding also implies that bitcoin price data can differ across exchanges demanding a careful approach to data sourcing. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The objective is to develop insights into the evolution of the Bitcoin economy during this period. For this, we establish and analyze a novel integrated dataset that enriches data from the Bitcoin blockchain with off-network data such as business categories and geo-locations. Our analyses reveal the major Bitcoin businesses and markets. Our results also give insights on the business distribution by countries and how businesses evolve over time. We also show that there is a gambling network that features many very small transactions. Furthermore, regional differences in the adoption and business distribution could be found. In the network analysis, the small world phenomenon is investigated and confirmed for several subgraphs of the Bitcoin network.

AB We study the strategic considerations of miners participating in the bitcoin's protocol. We formulate and study the stochastic game that underlies these strategic considerations. The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.

The results indicated that K-Dapp for Cu2+ binding to PS-containing SLBs was enhanced by a factor of 17 000 from 110 nM to 6.4 pM as the PS density in the membrane was increased from 1.0 to 20 mol %. Although Cu2+ bound bivalently to POPS at higher PS concentrations, this was not the dominant factor in increasing the binding affinity. Rather, the higher concentration of Cu2+ within the double layer above the membrane was largely responsible for the tightening. Unlike the binding of other divalent metal ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ to PS, Cu2+ binding does not alter the net negative charge on the membrane as the Cu(PS)(2) complex forms. As such, the Cu2+ concentration within the double layer region was greatly amplified relative to its concentration in bulk solution as the PS density was increased. This created a far larger enhancement to the apparent binding affinity than is observed by standard multivalent effects. These findings should help provide an understanding on the extent of Cu2+PS binding in cell membranes, which may be relevant to biological processes such as amyloid-beta peptide toxicity and lipid oxidation.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized P2P digital currency in which coins are generated by a distributed set of miners and transactions are broadcasted via a peer-to-peer network. While Bitcoin provides some level of anonymity (or rather pseudonymity) by encouraging the users to have any number of random-looking Bitcoin addresses, recent research shows that this level of anonymity is rather low. This encourages users to connect to the Bitcoin network through anonymizers like Tor and motivates development of default Tor functionality for popular mobile SPV clients. In this paper we show that combining Tor and Bitcoin creates a new attack vector. A low-resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use Bitcoin over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together user's transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which Bitcoin blocks and transactions are relayed to user and can delay or discard user's transactions and blocks. Moreover, we show how an attacker can fingerprint users and then recognize them and learn their IP addresses when they decide to connect to the Bitcoin network directly.

AB Given the increasing adoption of Bitcoin, the number of transactions and the block sizes within the system are only expected to increase. To sustain its correct operation in spite of its ever-increasing use, Bitcoin implements a number of necessary optimizations and scalability measures. These measures limit the amount of information broadcast in the system to the minimum necessary.
   In this paper, we show that current scalability measures adopted by Bitcoin come at odds with the security of the system. More specifically, we show that an adversary can exploit these measures in order to effectively delay the propagation of transactions and blocks to specific nodes for a considerable amount of time-without causing a network partitioning in the system. Notice that this attack alters the information received by Bitcoin nodes, and modifies their views of the ledger state. Namely, we show that this allows the adversary to considerably increase its mining advantage in the network, and to double-spend transactions in spite of the current countermeasures adopted by Bitcoin. Based on our results, we propose a number of countermeasures in order to enhance the security of Bitcoin without deteriorating its scalability.

TI Harnessing entropy to direct the bonding/debonding of polymer systems
   based on reversible chemistry
SO CHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB The widely accepted approach for controlling polymer debonding/rebonding properties in responsive materials has been to purposefully engineer the functional end-groups responsible for monomer dynamic bonding. Here, however, we evidence that the debonding temperature of a polymer can also be tuned by changing the chain length of the polymer building blocks, thus altering the entropy released on debonding. Entropy driven debonding, as governed by building block chain length, is suggested theoretically and realized experimentally for two Diels-Alder polymer systems, each based on a different difunctional diene and a common difunctional dienophile. In each case a significant decrease (as much as 60 degrees C) in the retro Diels-Alder temperature was observed when the chain length of the difunctional dienophile building block was increased. These results have the potential to fundamentally change the approach utilized to design materials capable of bonding reversibly on demand.

TI Blockchain-Based Decentralized Trust Management in Vehicular Networks
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Vehicular networks enable vehicles to generate and broadcast messages in order to improve traffic safety and efficiency. However, due to the nontrusted environments, it is difficult for vehicles to evaluate the credibilities of received messages. In this paper, we propose a decentralized trust management system in vehicular networks based on blockchain techniques. In this system, vehicles can validate the received messages from neighboring vehicles using Bayesian Inference Model. Based on the validation result, the vehicle will generate a rating for each message source vehicle. With the ratings uploaded from vehicles, roadside units (RSUs) calculate the trust value offsets of involved vehicles and pack these data into a "block." Then, each RSU will try to add their "blocks" to the trust blockchain which is maintained by all the RSUs. By employing the joint proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the more total value of offsets (stake) is in the block, the easier RSU can find the nonce for the hash function (PoW). In this way, all RSUs collaboratively maintain an updated, reliable, and consistent trust blockchain. Simulation results reveal that the proposed system is effective and feasible in collecting, calculating, and storing trust values in vehicular networks.

TI Energy Demand Side Management within micro-grid networks enhanced by
   blockchain
SO APPLIED ENERGY
CT Conference on Renewable Energy Markets (REM)
CY OCT 22-24, 2017
CL New York, NY
AB The management of energy supply and demand is becoming more challenging, especially in regions where the demand continues to grow rapidly and more intermittent renewable supply sources are added to the energy infrastructure. In this context, Demand Side Management (DSM) can be employed to align supply and demand and improve reliability of the system under supply constraints and stretch the capacity limits of the existing grid infrastructure. A game theoretic approach for a DSM model incorporating storage components is suggested in this paper especially for environments with energy supply constraints. The proposed model is able to not only reduce the Peak-to-Average ratio to benefit the electrical grid, but can also smoothen the dips in the load profile caused by supply constraints. In a case study to demonstrate the value of the model presented, a variety of residential demand types are evaluated within a micro-grid to maximize the payoff utility of both individual users and the whole system. Moreover, emerging blockchain technologies are introduced to guarantee the seamless and secure implementation of the proposed scheme, illustrating how a decentralized demand side management approach could be implemented in practice to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions following optimized demand profiles.

TI CreditCoin: A Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Incentive Announcement
   Network for Communications of Smart Vehicles
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB The vehicular announcement network is one of the most promising utilities in the communications of smart vehicles and in the smart transportation systems. In general, there are two major issues in building an effective vehicular announcement network. First, it is difficult to forward reliable announcements without revealing users' identities. Second, users usually lack the motivation to forward announcements. In this paper, we endeavor to resolve these two issues through proposing an effective announcement network called CreditCoin, a novel privacy-preserving incentive announcement network based on Blockchain via an efficient anonymous vehicular announcement aggregation protocol. On the one hand, CreditCoin allows nondeterministic different signers (i.e., users) to generate the signatures and to send announcements anonymously in the nonfully trusted environment. On the other hand, with Blockchain, CreditCoin motivates users with incentives to share traffic information. In addition, transactions and account information in CreditCoin are tamper-resistant. CreditCoin also achieves conditional privacy since Trace manager in CreditCoin traces malicious users' identities in anonymous announcements with related transactions. CreditCoin thus is able to motivate users to forward announcements anonymously and reliably. Extensive experimental results show that CreditCoin is efficient and practical in simulations of smart transportation.

We show that whilst Bitcoin returns are showing signs of efficiency, numerous cryptocurrencies still exhibit signs of autocorrelation and non independence. Our findings also show a strong relationship between the Hurst exponent and liquidity on a cross-sectional basis. Therefore, we conclude that liquidity plays a significant role in market efficiency and return predictability of new cryptocurrencies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Secure and scalable data sharing is essential for collaborative clinical decision making. Conventional clinical data efforts are often siloed, however, which creates barriers to efficient information exchange and impedes effective treatment decision made for patients. This paper provides four contributions to the study of applying blockchain technology to clinical data sharing in the context of technical requirements defined in the "Shared Nationwide Interoperability Roadmap" from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). First, we analyze the ONC requirements and their implications for blockchain-based systems. Second, we present FHIRChain, which is a blockchain-based architecture designed to meet ONC requirements by encapsulating the HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard for shared clinical data. Third, we demonstrate a FHIRChain-based decentralized app using digital health identities to authenticate participants in a case study of collaborative decisionmaking for remote cancer care. Fourth, we highlight key lessons learned from our case study. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Research Network of Computational and Structural Biotechnology.

TI Blockchain and value systems in the sharing economy: The illustrative
   case of Backfeed
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This article explores the potential of blockchain technology in enabling a new system of value that will better support the dynamics of social sharing. Our study begins with a discussion of the evolution of value perceptions in the history of economic thought. Starting with a view on value as a coordination mechanism that defines meaningful action within a certain context, we associate the price system with the establishment of capitalism and the industrial economy. We then discuss its relevance to the information economy, exhibited as the techno-economic context of the sharing economy, and identify new modalities of value creation that better reflect the social relations of sharing. Through the illustrative case of Backfeed, a new system of value is envisioned, comprising three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; and (c) actualisation of value. In this framework, we discuss the solutions featured by Backfeed and describe a conceptual economic model of blockchain-based decentralised cooperation. We conclude with a tentative scenario for blockchain technology that can enable the creation of commons-oriented ecosystems in a sharing economy.

   address climate change uncertainty
SO ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
AB Implementing climate-resilient pathways in conditions of uncertainty and change is a serious challenge. Approaches have been developed for this type of problem, one of which, Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach (DAPP), has been applied in practice in a limited number of circumstances, mainly for large infrastructure projects and at national scales. To better understand what it takes to catalyse uptake of DAPP to better address uncertainty and change than typical static planning approaches, we examined the role of a simulation game facilitated by a knowledge broker, in a real-life local decision setting on flood risk management in New Zealand. Four intervention phases over four years are described and their influence analysed: 1) creating interest through framing the science, 2) increasing awareness using the Game, 3) experimenting with DAPP, and 4) uptake of DAPP. We found that a knowledge broker introducing new framing of changing risk profiles, facilitating use of the Game and the-DAPP approach in a real-life decision making setting, with contextual support from events and (inter)national reports, catalysed the uptake of adaptive pathways planning. We identified enabling requirements necessary for embedding adaptive planning into decision-making practice for addressing uncertainty and change. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Blockchain may help solve several complex problems related to securing the integrity and trustworthiness of rapid, distributed, complex energy transactions and data exchanges. In a move towards grid resilience, blockchain commoditizes trust and enables automated smart contracts to support auditable multiparty transactions based on predefined rules between distributed energy providers and customers. Blockchain based smart contracts also help remove the need to interact with third-parties, facilitating the adoption and monetization of distributed energy transactions and exchanges, both energy flows as well as financial transactions. This may help reduce transactive energy costs and increase the security and sustainability of distributed energy resource (DER) integration, helping to remove barriers to a more decentralized and resilient power grid. This paper explores the application of blockchain and smart contracts to improve smart grid cyber resiliency and secure transactive energy applications.

AB Weighted signed networks (WSNs) are networks in which edges are labeled with positive and negative weights. WSNs can capture like/dislike, trust/distrust, and other social relationships between people. In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting the weights of edges in such networks. We propose two novel measures of node behavior: the goodness of a node intuitively captures how much this node is liked/trusted by other nodes, while the fairness of a node captures how fair the node is in rating other nodes' likeability or trust level. We provide axioms that these two notions need to satisfy and show that past work does not meet these requirements for WSNs. We provide a mutually recursive definition of these two concepts and prove that they converge to a unique solution in linear time. We use the two measures to predict the edge weight in WSNs. Furthermore, we show that when compared against several individual algorithms from both the signed and unsigned social network literature, our fairness and goodness metrics almost always have the best predictive power. We then use these as features in different multiple regression models and show that we can predict edge weights on 2 Bitcoin WSNs, an Epinions WSN, 2 WSNs derived from Wikipedia, and a WSN derived from Twitter with more accurate results than past work. Moreover, fairness and goodness metrics form the most significant feature for prediction in most (but not all) cases.

AB We present an empirical investigation into the prevalence and impact of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on operators in the Bitcoin economy. To that end, we gather and analyze posts mentioning "DDoS" on the popular Bitcoin forum bitcointalk.org. Starting from around 3 000 different posts made between May 2011 and October 2013, we document 142 unique DDoS attacks on 40 Bitcoin services. We find that 7% of all known operators have been attacked, but that currency exchanges, mining pools, gambling operators, eWallets, and financial services are much more likely to be attacked than other services. Not coincidentally, we find currency exchanges and mining pools are much more likely to have DDoS protection such as CloudFlare, Incapsula, or Amazon Cloud. We show that those services that have been attacked are more than three times as likely to buy anti-DDoS services than operators who have not been attacked. We find that big mining pools (those with historical hashrate shares of at least 5%) are much more likely to be DDoSed than small pools. We investigate Mt. Gox as a case study for DDoS attacks on currency exchanges and find a disproportionate amount of DDoS reports made during the large spike in trading volume and exchange rates in spring 2013. We conclude by outlining future opportunities for researching DDoS attacks on Bitcoin.

AB The privacy of patients is jeopardised when medical records and data are spread or shared beyond the protected cloud of institutions. This is because breaches force them to the brink that they start abstaining from full disclosure of their condition. This type of condition has a negative effect on scientific research, patients and all stakeholders. A blockchain-based data sharing system is proposed to tackle this issue, which employs immutability and autonomy properties of the blockchain to sufficiently resolve challenges associated with access control and handle sensitive data. Our proposed system is supported by a Discrete Wavelet Transform to enhance the overall security, and a Genetic Algorithm technique to optimise the queuing optimization technique as well. Introducing this cryptographic key generator enhances the immunity and system access control, which allows verifying users securely in a fast way. This design allows further accountability since all users involved are already known and the blockchain records a log of their actions. Only when the users' cryptographic keys and identities are confirmed, the system allows requesting data from the shared queuing requests. The achieved execution time per node, confirmation time per node and robust index for block number of 0.19 s, 0.17 s and 20 respectively that based on system evaluation illustrates that our system is robust, efficient, immune and scalable.

TI Does economic policy uncertainty predict the Bitcoin returns? An
   empirical investigation
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This paper analyzes the prediction power of the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index on the daily Bitcoin returns. Using the Bayesian Graphical Structural Vector Autoregressive model as well as the Ordinary Least Squares and the Quantile-on-Quantile Regression estimations, the paper finds that the EPU has a predictive power on Bitcoin returns. Fundamentally, Bitcoin returns are negatively associated with the EPU. However, the effect is positive and significant at both lower and higher quantiles of Bitcoin returns and the EPU. In the light of these findings, the paper concludes that Bitcoin can serve as a hedging tool against uncertainty.

TI Citizen utilities: The emerging power paradigm
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB The emergence of citizen-based power systems in an integrated grid has been anticipated for decades. We can reveal how this is emerging in practice due to the significant uptake of solar photovoltaics (solar PV) and now battery storage in Perth, Australia. The high cost of electricity, high radiant energy levels and easy access to cheap Chinese technology, has led to dramatic buying during Perth's recent boomtown years. The traditional uni-directional power system is rapidly disrupting and this paper assesses where this may lead and what it means for the grid. Results of detailed monitoring in a solar powered house along with the impact of a battery storage system show the impact on the traditional grid is substantial but it will still be needed and must therefore adapt to the new distributed, bi-directional energy system. Surveys and price trajectories reveal how the trends to solar power storage will continue and how a citizen utility paradigm will emerge as the future grid building block using new blockchain support systems. Responses from utilities are then see to be fight, flight or innovate.

SP Int Soc Study Drug Policy
AB Background: Cryptomarkets are digital platforms that use anonymising software (e.g. Tor) and cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin) to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) trade of goods and services. Their emergence has facilitated access to a wide range of high-quality psychoactive substances, according to surveys of users. In this paper, we ask the question 'How does changing access to drugs through cryptomarkets affect the drug use and harm trajectories of their users?'
   Methods: We conducted a digital ethnography spanning 2012-2014, a period that included the seizure of the original Silk Road marketplace and forum by law enforcement. Using encrypted online chat, we interviewed 17 people who reported using Silk Road to purchase illicit drugs. The interviews were in-depth and unstructured, and also involved the use of life history timelines to trace trajectories. Transcripts were analysed thematically using NVivo.
   Results: For some, Silk Road facilitated initiation into drug use or a return to drug use after cessation. Typically, participants reported experiencing a glut of drug consumption in their first months using Silk Road, described by one participant as akin to 'kids in a candy store'. There was evidence that very high availability reduced the need for drug hoarding which helped some respondents to moderate use and feel more in control of purchases made online. Cryptomarket access also appeared to affect solitary and social drug users differently. Most participants described using other cryptomarkets after the closure of Silk Road, albeit with less confidence.
   Conclusion: In the context of high levels of drug access, supply and diversity occurring within a community regulated environment online, the impacts of cryptomarkets upon drug use trajectories are complex, often posing new challenges for self-control, yet not always leading to harmful outcomes. A major policy challenge is how to provide support for harm reduction in these highly volatile settings. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Multivalent Dendrimer Vectors with DNA Intercalation Motifs for Gene
   Delivery
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers constitute an important class of nonviral, cationic vectors in gene delivery. Here we report on a new concept for dendrimer vector design based on the incorporation of dual binding motifs: DNA intercalation, and receptor recognition for targeted delivery. We prepared a series of dendrimer conjugates derived from a fifth generation (G5) PAMAM dendrimer, each conjugated with multiple folate (FA) or riboflavin (RF) ligands for cell receptor targeting, and with 3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridinium ("DAPP")-derived ligands for anchoring a DNA payload. Polyplexes of each dendrimer with calf thymus dsDNA were made and characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurement. These studies provided evidence supporting polyplex formation based on the observation of tight DNA-dendrimer adhesion, and changes in particle size and surface charge upon coincubation. Further SPR studies to investigate the adhesion of the polyplex to a model surface immobilized with folate binding protein (FBP), demonstrated that the DNA payload has only a minimal effect on the receptor binding activity of the polyplex: K-D = 0.22 nM for G5(FA)(DAPP) versus 0.98 nM for its polyplex. Finally, we performed in vitro transfection assays to determine the efficiency of conjugate mediated delivery of a luciferase-encoding plasmid into the KB cancer cell line and showed that RF-conjugated dendrimers were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude more effective in enhancing luciferase gene transfection than a plasmid only control. In summary, this study serves as a proof of concept for DNA-ligand intercalation as a motif in the design of multivalent dendrimer vectors for targeted gene delivery.

   Clinical Sample
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT
AB This study examined the associations of specific personality traits and general personality dysfunction in relation to the presence and severity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM-IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) personality disorders in a Dutch clinical sample. Two widely used measures of specific personality traits were selected, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory as a measure of normal personality traits, and the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire as a measure of pathological traits. In addition, 2 promising measures of personality dysfunction were selected, the General Assessment of Personality Disorder and the Severity Indices of Personality Problems. Theoretically predicted associations were found between the measures, and all measures predicted the presence and severity of DSM-IV personality disorders. The combination of general personality dysfunction models and personality traits models provided incremental information about the presence and severity of personality disorders, suggesting that an integrative approach of multiple perspectives might serve comprehensive assessment of personality disorders.

TI A robust block-chain based tabu search algorithm for the dynamic lot
   sizing problem with product returns and remanufacturing
SO OMEGA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB This paper studies the dynamic lot sizing problem with product returns and remanufacturing (DLRR). Given demands and returns over a planning horizon, DLRR is to determine a production schedule of manufacturing new products and/or remanufacturing returns such that demand in each period is satisfied and the total cost (set-up cost plus holding cost of inventory) is minimized.
   Since DLRR with general cost functions for set-ups of manufacturing and remanufacturing is NP-hard, we develop a tabu search to produce high-quality solutions. To generate a good initial solution, we use a block-chain based method where the planning horizon is split into a chain of blocks. A block may contain either a string of manufacturing set-ups, a string of remanufacturing set-ups, or both. Given the cost of each block, an initial solution corresponding to a best combination of blocks is found by solving a shortest-path problem. Neighboring operators aim at shifting integer variables for manufacturing and remanufacturing set-ups.
   We evaluate our algorithm on 6480 benchmark problems and compare it with other available algorithms. Computational results demonstrate that our algorithm produces an optimal solution in 96.60% of benchmark problems, with an average deviation of 0.00082% from optimality and it is a state-of-the-art method for DLRR.

TI Regulation of parkin and PINK1 by neddylation
SO HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS
AB Neddylation is a posttranslational modification that plays important roles in regulating protein structure and function by covalently conjugating NEDD8, an ubiquitin-like small molecule, to the substrate. Here, we report that Parkinsons disease (PD)-related parkin and PINK1 are NEDD8 conjugated. Neddylation of parkin and PINK1 results in increased E3 ligase activity of parkin and selective stabilization of the 55 kDa PINK1 fragment. Expression of dAPP-BP1, a NEDD8 activation enzyme subunit, in Drosophila suppresses abnormalities induced by dPINK1 RNAi. PD neurotoxin MPP inhibits neddylation of both parkin and PINK1. NEDD8 immunoreactivity is associated with Lewy bodies in midbrain dopaminergic neurons of PD patients. Together, these results suggest that parkin and PINK1 are regulated by neddylation and that impaired NEDD8 modification of these proteins likely contributes to PD pathogenesis.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB The impact of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 on the ripple effect and disruption risk control analytics in the supply chain (SC) is studied. The research framework combines the results from two isolated areas, i.e. the impact of digitalisation on SC management (SCM) and the impact of SCM on the ripple effect control. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that connects business, information, engineering and analytics perspectives on digitalisation and SC risks. This paper does not pretend to be encyclopedic, but rather analyses recent literature and case-studies seeking to bring the discussion further with the help of a conceptual framework for researching the relationships between digitalisation and SC disruptions risks. In addition, it emerges with an SC risk analytics framework. It analyses perspectives and future transformations that can be expected in transition towards cyber-physical SCs. With these two frameworks, this study contributes to the literature by answering the questions of (1) what relations exist between big data analytics, Industry 4.0, additive manufacturing, advanced trace & tracking systems and SC disruption risks; (2) how digitalisation can contribute to enhancing ripple effect control; and (3) what digital technology-based extensions can trigger the developments towards SC risk analytics.

We find that the transaction cost of Bitcoin is lower than that of retail foreign exchange markets. Bitcoin markets have, on average, 2% narrower bid-ask spreads than retail foreign exchange markets and, when the U.S. dollar is converted to other currencies via Bitcoin, the resulting exchange rates are, on average, 5% better than the retail foreign exchange rate.

AB To investigate whether machine learning-based analysis of MR radiomics can help improve the performance PI-RADS v2 in clinically relevant prostate cancer (PCa).
   This IRB-approved study included 54 patients with PCa undergoing multi-parametric (mp) MRI before prostatectomy. Imaging analysis was performed on 54 tumours, 47 normal peripheral (PZ) and 48 normal transitional (TZ) zone based on histological-radiological correlation. Mp-MRI was scored via PI-RADS, and quantified by measuring radiomic features. Predictive model was developed using a novel support vector machine trained with: (i) radiomics, (ii) PI-RADS scores, (iii) radiomics and PI-RADS scores. Paired comparison was made via ROC analysis.
   For PCa versus normal TZ, the model trained with radiomics had a significantly higher area under the ROC curve (Az) (0.955 [95% CI 0.923-0.976]) than PI-RADS (Az: 0.878 [0.834-0.914], p < 0.001). The Az between them was insignificant for PCa versus PZ (0.972 [0.945-0.988] vs. 0.940 [0.905-0.965], p = 0.097). When radiomics was added, performance of PI-RADS was significantly improved for PCa versus PZ (Az: 0.983 [0.960-0.995]) and PCa versus TZ (Az: 0.968 [0.940-0.985]).

Overcoming these limitations is critical for improving both functional properties of blockchains, such as confidentiality and consistency, as well as their non-functional properties, such as performance and scalability.
   We discuss these limitations in the context of permissioned blockchains, including an early version of the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform, and how a re-design of Hyperledger Fabric's architecture addresses them.

AB Several new services incentivize clients to compete in solving large computation tasks in exchange for financial rewards. This model of competitive distributed computation enables every user connected to the Internet to participate in a game in which he splits his computational power among a set of competing pools - the game is called a computational power splitting game. We formally model this game and show its utility in analyzing the security of pool protocols that dictate how financial rewards are shared among the members of a pool.
   As a case study, we analyze the Bitcoin cryptocurrency which attracts computing power roughly equivalent to billions of desktop machines, over 70% of which is organized into public pools. We show that existing pool reward sharing protocols are insecure in our game-theoretic analysis under an attack strategy called the "block withholding attack". This attack is a topic of debate, initially thought to be ill-incentivized in today's pool protocols: i.e., causing a net loss to the attacker, and later argued to be always profitable. Our analysis shows that the attack is always well-incentivized in the long-run, but may not be so for a short duration. This implies that existing pool protocols are insecure, and if the attack is conducted systematically, Bitcoin pools could lose millions of dollars worth in months. The equilibrium state is a mixed strategy-that is-in equilibrium all clients are incentivized to probabilistically attack to maximize their payoffs rather than participate honestly. As a result, the Bitcoin network is incentivized to waste a part of its resources simply to compete.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY
AB Three endophytic bacterial isolates were obtained in Italy from olive knots caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi. Phenotypic tests in combination with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated a phylogenetic position for these isolates in the genera Erwinia or Pantoea, and revealed two other strains with highly similar 16S rRNA gene sequences (>99%), CECT 5262 and CECT 5264, obtained in Spain from olive knots. Rep-PCR DNA fingerprinting of the five strains from olive knots with BOX, ERIC and REP primers revealed three groups of profiles that were highly similar to each other. Multi locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on concatenated partial atpD, gyrB, infB and rpoB gene sequences indicated that the strains constituted a single novel species in the genus Erwinia. The strains showed general phenotypic characteristics typical of the genus Erwinia and whole genome DNA-DNA hybridization data confirmed that they represented a single novel species of the genus Erwinia. The strains showed DNA G+C contents ranging from 54.7 to 54.9 mol%. They could be discriminated from phylogenetically related species of the genus Erwinia by their ability to utilize potassium gluconate, L-rhamnose and D-arabitol, but not glycerol, inositol or D-sorbitol. The name Erwinia oleae sp. nov. (type strain DAPP-PG 531(T)=LMG 25322(T)=DSM 23398(T)) is proposed for this novel taxon.

TI The fine structure of cassava starch amylopectin. Part 2: Building block
   structure of clusters
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB The aim of this work was to analyse the organization of unit chains inside clusters of cassava amylopectin. beta-Limit dextrins of the clusters and partly fragmented clusters (sub-clusters) were isolated previously [Laohaphatanaleart et al., Int. J. Biol. Macromol. (2010) doi:10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2010.01.0049] and were now hydrolysed extensively with the alpha-amylase (liquefying type) of Bacillus subtilis into small, branched building blocks. The blocks were size-fractionated and characterized structurally. The smallest blocks predominated in the clusters. They were single branched and possessed a degree of polymerization (DP) of 5-9. Blocks with DP 10-15 were double branched and constituted the second largest group. The clusters of cassava amylopectin, which were of rather uniform size, possessed typically 7-9 building blocks, and all clusters contained similar size-distributions of the blocks. The inter-block chain length was 7-8 residues. The possible mode of attack by the enzyme between the building blocks is discussed. A model of the building block organization in the clusters is presented, in which the structural roles of different subgroups of clustered chains are suggested. A three-dimensional model suggests a possible organization of the building blocks inside the amorphous lamellae in the granular starch. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Evolutionary dynamics of the cryptocurrency market
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB The cryptocurrencymarket surpassed the barrier of $100 billion market capitalization in June 2017, after months of steady growth. Despite its increasing relevance in the financial world, a comprehensive analysis of the whole system is still lacking, as most studies have focused exclusively on the behaviour of one (Bitcoin) or few cryptocurrencies. Here, we consider the history of the entire market and analyse the behaviour of 1469 cryptocurrencies introduced between April 2013 and May 2017. We reveal that, while new cryptocurrencies appear and disappear continuously and their market capitalization is increasing (super-) exponentially, several statistical properties of the market have been stable for years. These include the number of active cryptocurrencies, market share distribution and the turnover of cryptocurrencies. Adopting an ecological perspective, we show that the so-called neutral model of evolution is able to reproduce a number of key empirical observations, despite its simplicity and the assumption of no selective advantage of one cryptocurrency over another. Our results shed light on the properties of the cryptocurrency market and establish a first formal link between ecological modelling and the study of this growing system. We anticipate they will spark further research in this direction.

TI Analysis and outlook of applications of blockchain technology to equity
   crowdfunding in China
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Equity crowdfunding via the Internet is a new channel of raising money for startups. It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems in the practice of equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.

AB The blockchain emerges as an innovative tool which proves to be useful in a number of application scenarios. A number of large industrial players, such as IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and NEC, are currently investing in exploiting the blockchain in order to enrich their portfolio of products. A number of researchers and practitioners speculate that the blockchain technology can change the way we see a number of online applications today. Although it is still early to tell for sure, it is expected that the blockchain will stimulate considerable changes to a large number of products and will positively impact the digital experience of many individuals around the globe.
   In this tutorial, we overview, detail, and analyze the security provisions of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain-effectively capturing recently reported attacks and threats in the system. Our contributions go beyond the mere analysis of reported vulnerabilities of Bitcoin; namely, we describe and evaluate a number of countermeasures to deter threats on the system-some of which have already been incorporated in the system. Recall that Bitcoin has been forked multiple times in order to fine-tune the consensus (i.e., the block generation time and the hash function), and the network parameters (e.g., the size of blocks). As such, the results reported in this tutorial are not only restricted to Bitcoin, but equally apply to a number of "altcoins" which are basically clones/forks of the Bitcoin source code.
   Given the increasing number of alternative blockchain proposals, this tutorial extracts the basic security lessons learnt from the Bitcoin system with the aim to foster better designs and analysis of next-generation secure blockchain currencies and technologies.

TI Review and taxonomies of assembly and disassembly path planning problems
   and approaches
SO COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN
AB Assembly Planning (AP) is one of the most important elements of process planning in manufacturing industries, and is defined as the process of creating a detailed assembly plan to craft a whole product from separate parts considering the final product geometry, available resources, fixture design, feeder and tool descriptions, etc. AP has three main subproblems: (1) Assembly Sequence Planning (ASP), in which a sequence of collision-free operations is computed for bringing assembly parts together, (2) Assembly Line Balancing (ALB), in which some groups of subassemblies are formed and assigned to assembly stations in a way that their workloads are balanced, and (3) Assembly Path Planning (APP), in which collision-free paths for adding parts to a subassembly are computed. Each of the above subproblems has a disassembly version, creating DASP, DALB, and DAPP problems. All of the above problems have proven to be either NP-hard or NP-Complete, and many researches have been conducted to solve them efficiently. While some surveys and reviews exist on the ASP/DASP and ALB/DALB problems, no comprehensive survey exists for APP/DAPP problems, despite their important role in the design process of products as invaluable tools for deploying concurrent engineering, end-of-life processing, maintenance and repair, and decreasing the cost and time of manufacturing products. This paper investigates the relations between the above six subproblems and reviews the state-of-the-art of the APP and DAPP problems and their solution approaches. Through two new taxonomies the properties and categories of APP/DAPP problems and solution approaches are identified and described, the characteristics and applications of the reviewed 60 most relevant works are exposed and analyzed comprehensively, and open problems in the field are identified.

AB Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for general NP statements are a powerful cryptographic primitive, both in theory and in practical applications. Recently, much research has focused on achieving an additional property, succinctness, requiring the proof to be very short and easy to verify. Such proof systems are known as zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), and are desired when communication is expensive, or the verifier is computationally weak.
   Existing zk-SNARK implementations have severe scalability limitations, in terms of space complexity as a function of the size of the computation being proved (e.g., running time of the NP statement's decision program). First, the size of the proving key is quasilinear in the upper bound on the computation size. Second, producing a proof requires "writing down" all intermediate values of the entire computation, and then conducting global operations such as FFTs.
   The bootstrapping technique of Bitansky et al. (STOC ' 13), following Valiant (TCC ' 08), offers an approach to scalability, by recursively composing proofs: proving statements about acceptance of the proof system's own verifier (and correctness of the program's latest step). Alas, recursive composition of known zk-SNARKs has never been realized in practice, due to enormous computational cost.
   Using new elliptic-curve cryptographic techniques, and methods for exploiting the proof systems' field structure and nondeterminism, we achieve the first zk-SNARK implementation that practically achieves recursive proof composition. Our zk-SNARK implementation runs random-access machine programs and produces proofs of their correct execution, on today's hardware, for any program running time. It takes constant time to generate the keys that support all computation sizes. Subsequently, the proving process only incurs a constant multiplicative overhead compared to the original computation's time, and an essentially-constant additive overhead in memory. Thus, our zk-SNARK implementation is the first to have a well-defined, albeit low, clock rate of "verified instructions per second".

TI Healthcare Blockchain System Using Smart Contracts for Secure Automated
   Remote Patient Monitoring
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB As Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other remote patient monitoring systems increase in popularity, security concerns about the transfer and logging of data transactions arise. In order to handle the protected health information (PHI) generated by these devices, we propose utilizing blockchain-based smart contracts to facilitate secure analysis and management of medical sensors. Using a private blockchain based on the Ethereum protocol, we created a system where the sensors communicate with a smart device that calls smart contracts and writes records of all events on the blockchain. This smart contract system would support real-time patient monitoring and medical interventions by sending notifications to patients and medical professionals, while also maintaining a secure record of who has initiated these activities. This would resolve many security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring and automate the delivery of notifications to all involved parties in a HIPAA compliant manner.

AB Blockchain is the basic technology of bitcoin. With the value appreciation and stable operation of bitcoin, blockchain is attracting more and more attention in many areas. Blockchain has the characteristics of decentralization, stability, security, and non-modifiability. It has the potential to change the network architecture. The consensus algorithm plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and efficiency of blockchain. Using a right algorithm may bring a significant increase to the performance of blockchain application. In this paper, we reviewed the basic principles and characteristics of the consensus algorithms and analyzed the performance and application scenarios of different consensus mechanisms. We also gave a technical guidance of selecting a suitable consensus algorithm and summarized the limitations and future development of blockchain technology.

TI Book-Smart, Not Street-Smart: Blockchain-Based Smart Contracts and The
   Social Workings of Law
SO ENGAGING SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY
AB This paper critiques blockchain-based "smart contracts," which aim to automatically and securely execute obligations without reliance on a centralized enforcement authority. Though smart contracts do have some features that might serve the goals of social justice and fairness, I suggest that they are based on a thin conception of what law does, and how it does it. Smart contracts focus on the technical form of contract to the exclusion of the social contexts within which contracts operate, and the complex ways in which people use them. In the real world, contractual obligations are enforced through all kinds of social mechanisms other than formal adjudication-and contracts serve many functions that are not explicitly legal in nature, or even designed to be formally enforced. I describe three categories of contracting practices in which people engage (the inclusion of facially unenforceable terms, the inclusion of purposefully underspecified terms, and willful nonenforcement of enforceable terms) to illustrate how contracts actually "work." The technology of smart contracts neglects the fact that people use contracts as social resources to manage their relations. The inflexibility that they introduce, by design, might short-circuit a number of social uses to which law is routinely put. Therefore, I suggest that attention to the social and relational contexts of contracting are essential considerations for the discussion, development, and deployment of smart contracts.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCIES, NETWORK EFFECTS, AND SWITCHING COSTS
SO CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
AB Cryptocurrencies are digital alternatives to traditional government-issued paper monies. Given the current state of technology and skepticism regarding the future purchasing power of existing monies, why have cryptocurrencies failed to gain widespread acceptance? I offer an explanation based on network effects and switching costs. In order to articulate the problem that agents considering cryptocurrencies face, I employ a simple model developed by Dowd and Greenaway (1993) (Dowd, K., and D. Greenaway. "Currency Competition, Network Externalities, and Switching Costs: Towards an Alternative View of Optimum Currency Areas." The Economic Journal, 103(420), 1993, 1180-89). The model demonstrates that agents may fail to adopt an alternative currency when network effects and switching costs are present, even if all agents agree that the prevailing currency is inferior. The limited success of bitcoin-almost certainly the most popular cryptocurrency to date-serves to illustrate. After briefly surveying episodes of successful monetary transition, I conclude that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are unlikely to generate widespread acceptance in the absence of either significant monetary instability or government support.

TI Desulfurization and in situ tar reduction within catalytic methanation
   of biogenous synthesis gas
SO FUEL
AB For the production of Raw-SNG (Substitute Natural Gas) from synthesis gas of allothermal biomass gasification beside the methanation reactions, also tar-cleaning and desulfurization must be considered. In this work the tar and sulphur containing synthesis gas of an allothermal bench-scale gasifier is used to investigate a process in which the three mentioned steps are done in a simple way, suitable for decentralized application. Therefore, for the step of desulfurization the use of metal-oxides in a simple fixed-bed adsorber is investigated. For the second and third step Nickel is not only used to catalyze the methanation-reaction, it is also used as catalyst for high-temperature hydrocarbon reforming. Both steps are carried out in one apparatus: In a polytropic reactor (reactor just cooled by thermal losses), the exothermic methanation-reaction leads to a temperature-rise in the reactor of up to around 500 degrees C. It is investigated, whether this rise in temperature is sufficient to achieve an in situ tar conversion. Due to strong chemisorptive bondings of sulphur components, remaining in the gas after the MeO-adsorber, as well as a result of the biomass-tar, an increased Ni-catalyst deactivation turns out to be disadvantageous. This work replies to the question whether this catalyst consumption results from remaining sulphur in the synthesis gas, or from carbon-depositions resulting from biomass-tar. Parameter-studies are done with the aim to reduce the mentioned catalyst-deactivation to an economically feasible level. In order to reach a synthesis gas to Raw-SNG-conversion near to the theoretic thermodynamic equilibrium, the overall reaction kinetics must be considered. It is determined which gas residence times are needed in order to reach the expected synthesis gas conversion. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI The Narcissistic Personality Inventory: A Useful Tool for Assessing
   Pathological Narcissism? Evidence From Patients With Narcissistic
   Personality Disorder
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT
AB The Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) has dominated research on narcissism in the field of social and personality psychology. Surprisingly, it is unclear whether the NPI is useful for identifying pathological narcissism in patients with Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). The goal of this study was to close this research gap. We used an extreme-group approach by including NPD patients and healthy controls and comparing their narcissism scores. We further investigated whether explicit self-esteem (assessed with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) suppressed the relationship between group membership and NPI narcissism. According to our results, NPD patients do not score higher on the NPI in comparison to healthy controls. Analysis of indirect effects revealed that differences in NPI scores are suppressed by NPD patients' low self-esteem. Our results indicate that the NPI is not a valid indicator of NPD, unless one controls for self-esteem. Implications for future research are discussed.

TI BSeIn: A blockchain-based secure mutual authentication with fine-grained
   access control system for industry 4.0
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB To be prepared for the 'Industry 4.0'-era, we propose a hierarchical framework comprising four tangible layers, which is designed to vertically integrate inter-organizational value networks, engineering value chain, manufacturing factories, etc. The conceptual framework allows us to efficiently implement a flexible and re-configurable smart factory. However, we need to consider security inherent in existing (stand-alone) devices and networks as well as those that may arise in such integrations. Especially the existing solutions are insufficient to address these fundamental security concerns. Thus, we present a blockchain-based system for secure mutual authentication, BSeIn, to enforce fine-grained access control polices. The proposed system (with integrated attribute signature, multi-receivers encryption and message authentication code) is designed to provide privacy and security guarantees such as anonymous authentication, auditability, and confidentiality. BSeIn also scales well due to the utilization of smart contract. We then evaluate the security and performance of BSeIn. For example, findings from the performance evaluation demonstrate that Initialization/Request Issuance/Chain Transaction/State Delivery/Permission Update phase only cost 12.123/4.810/6.978/0.013/2.559s, respectively.

TI On the Fintech Revolution: Interpreting the Forces of Innovation,
   Disruption, and Transformation in Financial Services
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB The financial services industry has been experiencing the recent emergence of new technology innovations and process disruptions. The industry overall, and many fintech start-ups are looking for new pathways to successful business models, the creation of enhanced customer experience, and approaches that result in services transformation. Industry and academic observers believe this to be more of a revolution than a set of less influential changes, with financial services as a whole due for major improvements in efficiency, customer centricity, and informedness. The long-standing dominance of leading firms that are not able to figure out how to effectively hook up with the Fintech Revolution is at stake. We present a new fintech innovation mapping approach that enables the assessment of the extent to which there are changes and transformations in four areas of financial services. We discuss: operations management in financial services and the changes occurring; technology innovations that have begun to leverage the execution and stakeholder value associated with payments, cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and cross-border payments; multiple innovations that have affected lending and deposit services, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and social media use; issues with respect to investments, financial markets, trading, risk management, robo-advisory and services influenced by blockchain and fintech innovations.

TI LNSC: A Security Model for Electric Vehicle and Charging Pile Management
   Based on Blockchain Ecosystem
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Energy (IoE) provides an effective networking technology for distributed green energy, which allows the connection of energy anywhere at any time. As an important part of the IoE, electric vehicles (EVs), and charging pile management are of great significance to the development of the IoE industry. Previous work has mainly focused on network performance optimization for its management, and few studies have considered the security of the management between EVs and charging piles. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized security model based on the lightning network and smart contract in the blockchain ecosystem; this proposed model is called the lightning network and smart contract (LNSC). The overall model involves registration, scheduling, authentication, and charging phases. The new proposed security model can be easily integrated with current scheduling mechanisms to enhance the security of trading between EVs and charging piles. Experimental results according to a realistic infrastructure are presented in this paper. These experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can effectively enhance vehicle security. Different performances of LNSC-based scheduling strategies are also presented.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bitcoin has recently attracted considerable attention in the fields of economics, cryptography, and computer science due to its inherent nature of combining encryption technology and monetary units. This paper reveals the effect of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) by analyzing the time series of Bitcoin process. We also select the most relevant features from Blockchain information that is deeply involved in Bitcoin's supply and demand and use them to train models to improve the predictive performance of the latest Bitcoin pricing process. We conduct the empirical study that compares the Bayesian neural network with other linear and non-linear benchmark models on modeling and predicting the Bitcoin process. Our empirical studies show that BNN performs well in predicting Bitcoin price time series and explaining the high volatility of the recent Bitcoin price.

TI A Blockchain Based Privacy-Preserving Incentive Mechanism in
   Crowdsensing Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Crowdsensing applications utilize the pervasive smartphone users to collect large-scale sensing data efficiently. The quality of sensing data depends on the participation of highly skilled users. To motivate these skilled users to participate, they should receive enough rewards for compensating their resource consumption. Available incentive mechanisms mainly consider the truthfulness of the mechanism, but mostly ignore the issues of security and privacy caused by a "trustful'' center. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain incentive mechanism in crowdsensing applications, in which a cryptocurrency built on blockchains is used as a secure incentive way. High quality contributors will get their payments that are recorded in transaction blocks. The miners will verify the transaction according to the sensing data assessment criteria published by the server. As the transaction information can disclose users' privacy, a node cooperation verification approach is proposed to achieve k-anonymity privacy protection. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we show the feasibility and security of our incentive mechanism.

TI TKSE: Trustworthy Keyword Search Over Encrypted Data With Two-Side
   Verifiability via Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As a very attractive computing paradigm, cloud computing makes it possible for resource-constrained users to enjoy cost-effective and flexible resources of diversity. Considering the untrustworthiness of cloud servers and the data privacy of users, it is necessary to encrypt the data before outsourcing it to the cloud. However, the form of encrypted storage also poses a series of problems, such as: How can users search over the outsourced data? How to realize user-side verifiability of search results to resist malicious cloud servers? How to enable server-side verifiability of outsourced data to check malicious data owners? How to achieve payment fairness between the user and the cloud without introducing any third party? Towards addressing these challenging issues, in this paper, we introduce TKSE, a trustworthy keyword search scheme over encrypted data without any third party, trusted or not. In TKSE, the encrypted data index based on digital signature allows a user to search over the outsourced encrypted data and check whether the search result returned by the cloud fulfills the pre-specified search requirements. In particular, for the first time, TKSE realizes server-side verifiability which protects honest cloud servers from being framed by malicious data owners in the data storage phase. Furthermore, blockchain technologies and hash functions are used to enable payment fairness of search fees without introducing any third party even if the user or the cloud is malicious. Our security analysis and performance evaluation indicate that TKSE is secure and efficient and it is suitable for cloud computing.

TI Intelligent Resource Management in Blockchain-Based Cloud Datacenters
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
AB Nowadays, more and more companies migrate business from their own servers to the cloud. With the influx of computational requests, datacenters consume tremendous energy every day, attracting great attention in the energy efficiency dilemma. In this paper, we investigate the energy-aware resource management problem in cloud datacenters, where green energy with unpredictable capacity is considered. Via proposing a robust blockchain-based decentralized resource management framework, we save the energy consumed by the request scheduler. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning method embedded in a smart contract to further minimize the energy cost. Because the reinforcement learning method is informed from the historical knowledge, it relies on no request arrival and energy supply. Experimental results on Google cluster traces and real-world electricity price show that our approach is able to reduce the datacenters' cost significantly compared with other benchmark algorithms.

TI Energy Trading for Fun and Profit Buy your neighbor's rooftop solar
   power or sell your own-it'll all be on a blockchain
SO IEEE SPECTRUM
AB WOULD YOU PAY SLIGHTLY MORE for your electricity if you knew it was sourced from photovoltaic panels on your neighbor's roof? Or, if you are that neighbor, would you use your solar power to charge a battery and dump that energy back onto the grid at peak hours, when the price was highest? The answers to these questions-which depend on how people would behave in an open energy market-are unknown, because that market does not exist. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs, the two dominant schemes for reimbursing residential energy production, pay out at a fixed rate, effectively decoupling producers from the price signals that might otherwise direct their behavior. But that may be changing. And we may have the blockchain to thank. Multiple projects are now under way to use technology that was originally intended to account for transactions in digital currency to track electricity production and put it up for sale.

TI Dopant-Assisted Positive Photoionization Ion Mobility Spectrometry
   Coupled with Time-Resolved Thermal Desorption for On-Site Detection of
   Triacetone Triperoxide and Hexamethylene Trioxide Diamine in Complex
   Matrices
SO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB Peroxide explosives, such as triacetone triper-oxide (TATP) and hexamethylene trioxide diamine (HMTD), were often used in the terrorist attacks, due to their easy synthesis, from readily starting materials. Therefore, an on-site detection method for TATP and HMTD is urgently needed. Herein, we developed a stand-alone dopant-assisted positive photoionization ion mobility spectrometry (DAPP-IMS) coupled with time-resolved thermal desorption introduction for rapid and sensitive detection of TATP and HMTD in complex matrices, such as white solids, soft drinks, and cosmetics. the optimal dopant for better separation between reactant ion peaks and product ion peaks as well as higher sensitivity, and the limits of detection (LODs) of TATP and HMTD standard samples were 23.3 and 0.2 ng, respectively. Explosives on the sampling swab were thermally desorbed and carried into the ionization region dynamically within 10 s, and the maximum released concentration of TATP or HMTD could be time-resolved from the matrix interference owing to the different volatility. Furthermore, with the combination of the fast response thermal desorber (within 0.8 s) and the quick data acquisition software to DAPP-IMS, two-dimensional data related to drift time (TATP: 6.98 ms, K-0 = 2.05 cm(2) V-1 s(-1); HMTD: 9.36 ms, K-0 = 1.53 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)) and desorption time was obtained for TATP and HMTD, which is beneficial for their identification in complex matrices.

TI How is Bitcoin Money?
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer electronic payment system that operates as an independent currency. This paper is a philosophical investigation of the ontological constitution of Bitcoin. Using Slavoj Ziek's ontological triad of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary, the paper distinguishes between three ideal typical theories of money: commodity theory, fiat theory, and credit theory. The constitution of Bitcoin is analysed by comparing the currency to each of these ideal types. It is argued that Bitcoin is commodity money without gold, fiat money without a state, and credit money without debt. In conclusion, it is suggested that Bitcoin poses an ideological challenge to conventional forms of money in so far as it not only provokes sedimented beliefs about money but also exposes the forms of exploitation, risk and even violence inherent in the existing system of state authorized credit money.

AB Thanks to their anonymity (pseudonymity) and elimination of trusted intermediaries, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have created or stimulated growth in many businesses and communities. Unfortunately, some of these are criminal, e.g., money laundering, illicit marketplaces, and ransomware.
   Next-generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum will include rich scripting languages in support of smart contracts, programs that autonomously intermediate transactions. In this paper, we explore the risk of smart contracts fueling new criminal ecosystems. Specifically, we show how what we call criminal smart contracts (CSCs) can facilitate leakage of confidential information, theft of cryptographic keys, and various real-world crimes (murder, arson, terrorism).
   We show that CSCs for leakage of secrets (a la Wikileaks) are efficiently realizable in existing scripting languages such as that in Ethereum. We show that CSCs for theft of cryptographic keys can be achieved using primitives, such as Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of Knowledge (SNARKs), that are already expressible in these languages and for which efficient supporting language extensions are anticipated. We show similarly that authenticated data feeds, an emerging feature of smart contract systems, can facilitate CSCs for real-world crimes (e.g., property crimes).
   Our results highlight the urgency of creating policy and technical safeguards against CSCs in order to realize the promise of smart contracts for beneficial goals.

   Between Criteria A and B
SO JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
AB The essential features of the general criteria for personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), are based on impairments in self and interpersonal functioning (criterion A) and pathological personality traits (criterion B). The current study investigated the relationship between criteria A and B in a German psychiatric sample (N = 149). Criterion A was measured by the General Assessment of Personality Disorder (GAPD); criterion B, by the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP) and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R). There was a significant relationship between the GAPD, the DAPP, and the NEO-PI-R. The DAPP and NEO-PI-R domains increased the predictive validity of the GAPD (by 7.5% and 14.6%, respectively). The GAPD increased the variance explained by the DAPP by 1.5% and by the NEO-PI-R by 6.5%. The results suggest a substantial relationship between criteria A and B. Criterion B shows incremental validity over criterion A but criterion A only in part over criterion B. Future research should investigate whether it is possible to assess functional impairment apart from personality traits.

AB We study a model of incentivizing correct computations in a variety of cryptographic tasks. For each of these tasks we propose a formal model and design protocols satisfying our model's constraints in a hybrid model where parties have access to special ideal functionalities that enable monetary transactions. We summarize our results:
   Verifiable computation. We consider a setting where a delegator outsources computation to a worker who expects to get paid in return for delivering correct outputs. We design protocols that compile both public and private verification schemes to support incentivizations described above.
   Secure computation with restricted leakage. Building on the recent work of Huang et al. (Security and Privacy 2012), we show an efficient secure computation protocol that monetarily penalizes an adversary that attempts to learn one bit of information but gets detected in the process.
   Fair secure computation. Inspired by recent work, we consider a model of secure computation where a party that aborts after learning the output is monetarily penalized. We then propose an ideal transaction functionality F-ML* and show a constant-round realization on the Bitcoin network. Then, in the F-ML* hybrid world we design a constant round protocol for secure computation in this model.
   Noninteractive bounties. We provide formal definitions and candidate realizations of noninteractive bounty mechanisms on the Bitcoin network which (1) allow a bounty maker to place a bounty for the solution of a hard problem by sending a single message, and (2) allow a bounty collector (unknown at the time of bounty creation) with the solution to claim the bounty, while (3) ensuring that the bounty maker can learn the solution whenever its bounty is collected, and (4) preventing malicious eavesdropping parties from both claiming the bounty as well as learning the solution.
   All our protocol realizations (except those realizing fair secure computation) rely on a special ideal functionality that is not currently supported in Bitcoin due to limitations imposed on Bitcoin scripts. Motivated by this, we propose validation complexity of a protocol, a formal complexity measure that captures the amount of computational effort required to validate Bitcoin transactions required to implement it in Bitcoin. Our protocols are also designed to take advantage of optimistic scenarios where participating parties behave honestly.

TI Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118) in Adolescents:
   Reliability and Validity
SO PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
AB The Severity Indices of Personality Problems (SIPP-118; Verheul et al., 2008) is a self-report questionnaire focusing on core components of (mal) adaptive personality functioning. The SIPP-118 was developed and validated in an adult population. In adult populations, the 16 facets of the SIPP-118 fit into 5 higher order domains: self-control, identity integration, relational capacities, social concordance, and responsibility. In this study we present the 1st psychometric properties of the SIPP-118 in adolescents. We compared the SIPP-118 scores of a patient and a nonpatient sample of adolescents, and compared personality disordered and non-personality disordered adolescents. In addition, the relationship between scores on the SIPP-118 and other clinical instruments (Symptom Checklist-90-Revised; SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1975; Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Personality; DAPP-BQ; Livesley & Jackson, 2002) was investigated. The questionnaires were completed by 378 adolescent patients and 389 adolescents in the community. Facets appeared to be homogeneous, as alpha coefficients ranged from .62 to .89, indicating moderate to acceptable reliability. Also, more pathological SIPP-118 scores were found in the patient sample, and more specifically in the personality disordered sample, suggesting that the facet scores of the SIPP-118 can discriminate between various populations (divergent validity). Correlation with other clinical instruments was moderate to high (-.82 to .10). Taken together, the SIPP-118 seems to be a promising instrument measuring personality pathology in adolescents.

TI Blockchain technology in the energy sector: A systematic review of
   challenges and opportunities
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used. 1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.

TI A Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Healthcare Blockchain for IoT
SO SENSORS
AB Medical care has become one of the most indispensable parts of human lives, leading to a dramatic increase in medical big data. To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting Internet of Things (IoT)-based wearable technology. Recent years have witnessed billions of sensors, devices, and vehicles being connected through the Internet. One such technologyremote patient monitoringis common nowadays for the treatment and care of patients. However, these technologies also pose grave privacy risks and security concerns about the data transfer and the logging of data transactions. These security and privacy problems of medical data could result from a delay in treatment progress, even endangering the patient's life. We propose the use of a blockchain to provide secure management and analysis of healthcare big data. However, blockchains are computationally expensive, demand high bandwidth and extra computational power, and are therefore not completely suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices meant for smart cities. In this work, we try to resolve the above-mentioned issues of using blockchain with IoT devices. We propose a novel framework of modified blockchain models suitable for IoT devices that rely on their distributed nature and other additional privacy and security properties of the network. These additional privacy and security properties in our model are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. The solutions given here make IoT application data and transactions more secure and anonymous over a blockchain-based network.

TI The Social Life of Bitcoin
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB This paper challenges the notion that Bitcoin is 'trust-free' money by highlighting the social practices, organizational structures and utopian ambitions that sustain it. At the paper's heart is the paradox that if Bitcoin succeeds in its own terms as an ideology, it will fail in practical terms as a form of money. The main reason for this is that the new currency is premised on the idea of money as a 'thing' that must be abstracted from social life in order for it to be protected from manipulation by bank intermediaries and political authorities. The image is of a fully mechanized currency that operates over and above social life. In practice, however, the currency has generated a thriving community around its political ideals, relies on a high degree of social organization in order to be produced, has a discernible social structure, and is characterized by asymmetries of wealth and power that are not dissimilar from the mainstream financial system. Unwittingly, then, Bitcoin serves as a powerful demonstration of the relational character of money.

TI Blockchain Technology for Healthcare: Facilitating the Transition to
   Patient-Driven Interoperability
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Interoperability in healthcare has traditionally been focused around data exchange between business entities, for example, different hospital systems. However, there has been a recent push towards patient-driven interoperability, in which health data exchange is patient-mediated and patient-driven. Patient-centered interoperability, however, brings with it new challenges and requirements around security and privacy, technology, incentives, and governance that must be addressed for this type of data sharing to succeed at scale. In this paper, we look at how blockchain technology might facilitate this transition through five mechanisms: (1) digital access rules, (2) data aggregation, (3) data liquidity, (4) patient identity, and (5) data immutability. We then look at barriers to blockchain-enabled patient-driven interoperability, specifically clinical data transaction volume, privacy and security, patient engagement, and incentives. We conclude by noting that while patient-driving interoperability is an exciting trend in healthcare, given these challenges, it remains to be seen whether blockchain can facilitate the transition from institution-centric to patient-centric data sharing.

TI Bitcoin's Academic Pedigree
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB IF YOU HAVE read about bitcoin in the press and have some familiarity with academic research in the field of cryptography, you might reasonably come away with the following impression: Several decades' worth of research on digital cash, beginning with David Chaum, (10,12) did not lead to commercial success because it required a centralized, bank-like server controlling the system, and no banks wanted to sign on. Along came bitcoin, a radically different proposal for a decentralized cryptocurrency that did not need the banks, and digital cash finally succeeded. Its inventor, the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, was an academic outsider, and bitcoin bears no resemblance to earlier academic proposals.

TI E-residency and blockchain
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB In December 2014, Estonia became the first nation to open its digital borders to enable anyone, anywhere in the world to apply to become an e-Resident. Estonian e-Residency is essentially a commercial initiative. The e-ID issued to Estonian e-Residents enables commercial activities with the public and private sectors. It does not provide citizenship in its traditional sense, and the e-ID provided to e-Residents is not a travel document. However, in many ways it is an international 'passport' to the virtual world. E-Residency is a profound change and the recent announcement that the Estonian government is now partnering with Bitnation to offer a public notary service to Estonian e-Residents based on blockchain technology is of significance. The application of blockchain to e-Residency has the potential to fundamentally change the way identity information is controlled and authenticated. This paper examines the legal, policy, and technical implications of this development. (C) 2017 Clare Sullivan & Eric Burger. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Tamper-Resistant Mobile Health Using Blockchain Technology
SO JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB Background: Digital health technologies, including telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth), and remote monitoring, are playing a greater role in medical practice. Safe and accurate management of medical information leads to the advancement of digital health, which in turn results in a number of beneficial effects. Furthermore, mHealth can help lower costs by facilitating the delivery of care and connecting people to their health care providers. Mobile apps help empower patients and health care providers to proactively address medical conditions through near real-time monitoring and treatment, regardless of the location of the patient or the health care provider. Additionally, mHealth data are stored in servers, and consequently, data management that prevents all forms of manipulation is crucial for both medical practice and clinical trials.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a tamper-resistant mHealth system using blockchain technology, which enables trusted and auditable computing using a decentralized network.
   Methods: We developed an mHealth system for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia using a smartphone app. The volunteer data collected with the app were stored in JavaScript Object Notation format and sent to the blockchain network. Thereafter, we evaluated the tamper resistance of the data against the inconsistencies caused by artificial faults.
   Results: Electronic medical records collected using smartphones were successfully sent to a private Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network. We verified the data update process under conditions where all the validating peers were running normally. The mHealth data were successfully updated under network faults. We further ensured that any electronic health record registered to the blockchain network was resistant to tampering and revision. The mHealth data update was compatible with tamper resistance in the blockchain network.
   Conclusions: Blockchain serves as a tamperproof system for mHealth. Combining mHealth with blockchain technology may provide a novel solution that enables both accessibility and data transparency without a third party such as a contract research organization.

AB Digital world has produced efficiencies, new innovative products, and close customer relationships globally by the effective use of mobile, IoT (Internet of Things), social media, analytics and cloud technology to generate models for better decisions. Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.

AB The blockchain technology has emerged as an attractive solution to address performance and security issues in distributed systems. Blockchain's public and distributed peer-to-peer ledger capability benefits cloud computing services which require functions such as, assured data provenance, auditing, management of digital assets, and distributed consensus. Blockchain's underlying consensus mechanism allows to build a tamper-proof environment, where transactions on any digital assets are verified by set of authentic participants or miners. With use of strong cryptographic methods, blocks of transactions are chained together to enable immutability on the records. However, achieving consensus demands computational power from the miners in exchange of handsome reward. Therefore, greedy miners always try to exploit the system by augmenting their mining power. In this paper, we first discuss blockchain's capability in providing assured data provenance in cloud and present vulnerabilities in blockchain cloud. We model the block withholding (BWH) attack in a blockchain cloud considering distinct pool reward mechanisms. BWH attack provides rogue miner ample resources in the blockchain cloud for disrupting honest miners' mining efforts, which was verified through simulations.

TI The invisible politics of Bitcoin: governance crisis of a decentralised
   infrastructure
SO INTERNET POLICY REVIEW
AB Bitcoin is a decentralised currency and payment system that seeks to eliminate the need for trusted authorities. It relies on a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic protocols to perform the functions of traditional financial intermediaries, such as verifying transactions and preserving the integrity of the system. This article examines the political economy of Bitcoin, in light of a recent dispute that divided the Bitcoin community with regard to a seemingly simple technical issue: whether or not to increase the block size of the Bitcoin blockchain. By looking at the socio-technical constructs of Bitcoin, the article distinguishes between two distinct coordination mechanisms: governance by the infrastructure (achieved via the Bitcoin protocol) and governance of the infrastructure (managed by the community of developers and other stakeholders). It then analyses the invisible politics inherent in these two mechanisms, which together display a highly technocratic power structure. On the one hand, as an attempt to be self-governing and self-sustaining, the Bitcoin network exhibits a strong market-driven approach to social trust and coordination, which has been embedded directly into the technical protocol. On the other hand, despite being an open source project, the development and maintenance of the Bitcoin code ultimately relies on a small core of highly skilled developers who play a key role in the design of the platform.

TI THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BITCOIN
SO ECONOMIC INQUIRY
AB The recent proliferation of bitcoin has been a boon for users but might pose problems for governments. Indeed, some governments have already taken steps to ban or discourage the use of bitcoin. In a model with endogenous matching and random consumption preferences, we find multiple monetary equilibria including one in which bitcoin coexists with official currency. We then identify the conditions under which government transactions policy might deter the use of bitcoin. We show that such a policy becomes more difficult if some users strictly prefer bitcoin because they can avoid other users holding the official currency in the matching process.

We present solutions to the anonymity problem for both transactions on Bitcoin's blockchain and off the blockchain (in so called micropayment channel networks). We use an untrusted third party to issue anonymous vouchers which users redeem for Bitcoin. Blind signatures and Bitcoin transaction contracts (aka smart contracts) ensure the anonymity and fairness during the bitcoin. voucher exchange. Our schemes are practical, secure and anonymous.

In this paper, we have performed a data collection process identifying more than 872000 different Bitcoin nodes. This data allows us to present information on the size of the Bitcoin P2P network, the node geographic distribution, the network stability in terms of interrupted availability of nodes, as well as some data regarding the propagation time of the transmitted information. Furthermore, although not every Bitcoin user can be identified as a P2P network node, measurements of the P2P network can be considered as a lower bound for Bitcoin usage, and they provide interesting results on the adoption of such virtual currency.

TI The General Factor of Personality: A critical test
SO PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB The present study provides evidence supporting the presence of a General Factor of Personality (GFP), which has been proposed to represent the apex of the hierarchy of personality traits. Furthermore, the construct validity of this general factor is assessed to address recent criticisms suggesting that the GFP may merely be a statistical artefact rather than a genuine higher-order personality dimension. In this study, two samples of monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins completed the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-IR), assessing individual differences in the Big Five traits of personality, and the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Problems-Differential Questionnaire (DAPP-DQ) measuring variance in abnormal personality traits. First unrotated factors were extracted from each of the two measures separately within each sample. Correlations between these factors were significant and high in both samples (.78 and.77), indicating that the factors represent similar constructs. The manner in which these findings help to validate the GFP is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a rapid development and significant advancement of ubiquitous applications seamlessly integrated within our daily life. Owing to the accompanying growth of the importance of privacy, a great deal of attention has focused on the issues of secure management and robust access control of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose the design of a blockchain connected gateway which adaptively and securely maintains user privacy preferences for IoT devices in the blockchain network. Individual privacy leakage can be prevented because the gateway effectively protects users' sensitive data from being accessed without their consent. A robust digital signature mechanism is proposed for the purposes of authentication and secure management of privacy preferences. Furthermore, we adopt the blockchain network as the underlying architecture of data processing and maintenance to resolve privacy disputes.

TI A Novel Electricity Transaction Mode of Microgrids Based on Blockchain
   and Continuous Double Auction
SO ENERGIES
AB The installed capacity of distributed generation (DG) based on renewable energy sources has increased continuously in power systems, and its market-oriented transaction is imperative. However, traditional transaction management based on centralized organizations has many disadvantages, such as high operation cost, low transparency, and potential risk of transaction data modification. Therefore, a decentralized electricity transaction mode for microgrids is proposed in this study based on blockchain and continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. A buyer and seller initially complete the transaction matching in the CDA market. In view of the frequent price fluctuation in the CDA market, an adaptive aggressiveness strategy is used to adjust the quotation timely according to market changes. DG and consumer exchange digital certificate of power and expenditure on the blockchain system and the interests of consumers are then guaranteed by multi-signature when DG cannot generate power due to failure or other reasons. The digital certification of electricity assets is replaced by the sequence number with specific tags in the transaction script, and the size of digital certification can be adjusted according to transaction energy quantity. Finally, the feasibility of market mechanism through specific microgrid case and settlement process is also provided.

TI Blockchain: The Evolutionary Next Step for ICT E-Agriculture
SO ENVIRONMENTS
AB Blockchain technology, while still challenged with key limitations, is a transformative Information and Communications Technology (ICT) that has changed our notion of trust. Improved efficiencies for agricultural sustainable development has been demonstrated when ICT-enabled farms have access to knowledge banks and other digital resources. UN FAO-recommended ICT e-agricultural infrastructure components are a confluence of ICT and blockchain technology requirements. When ICT e-agricultural systems with blockchain infrastructure are immutable and distributed ledger systems for record management, baseline agricultural environmental data integrity is safeguarded for those who participate in transparent data management. This paper reviewed blockchain-based concepts associated with ICT-based technology. Moreover, a model ICT e-agriculture system with a blockchain infrastructure is proposed for use at the local and regional scale. To determine context specific technical and social requirements of blockchain technology for ICT e-agriculture systems, an evaluation tool is presented. The proposed system and tool can be evaluated and applied to further developments of e-agriculture systems.

AB As the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered, one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the Internet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing advertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous Systems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin traffic.
   This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on Bitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we show that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker can hijack few (< 100) BGP prefixes to isolate similar to 50% of the mining power-even when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by interfering with few key Bitcoin messages.
   We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin software. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.
   The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice, we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be deployed immediately.

AB The Bitcoin protocol requires nodes to quickly distribute newly created blocks. Strong nodes can, however, gain higher payoffs by withholding blocks they create and selectively postponing their publication. The existence of such selfish mining attacks was first reported by Eyal and Sirer, who have demonstrated a specific deviation from the standard protocol (a strategy that we name SM1).
   In this paper we investigate the profit threshold - the minimal fraction of resources required for a profitable attack. Our analysis provides a bound under which the system can be considered secure against such attacks. Our techniques can be adapted to protocol modifications to assess their susceptibility to selfish mining, by computing the optimal attack under different variants. We find that the profit threshold is strictly lower than the one induced by the SM1 scheme. The policies given by our algorithm dominate SM1 by better regulating attack-withdrawals. We further evaluate the impact of some previously suggested countermeasures, and show that they are less effective than previously conjectured.
   We then gain insight into selfish mining in the presence of communication delays, and show that, under a model that accounts for delays, the profit threshold vanishes, and even small attackers have incentive to occasionally deviate from the protocol. We conclude with observations regarding the combined power of selfish mining and double spending attacks.

AB In recent times food safety has drawn upsurge of academic and commercial concerns. In supply chain area, with the rapid growth of internet technologies, a lot of emerging technologies have been applied in traceability systems. However, to date, nearly all of these systems are centralized which are monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque that could result in the trust problem, such as fraud, corruption, tampering and falsifying information. Besides, centralized system is vulnerable to collapse, since a single point of breakdown will lead the whole system to be crashed. Today, a new technology called the blockchain which is a ground-breaking innovation in decentralized information technology presents a whole new approach. However, since this technology is still in its early stages, it has some inherent defects, in which scalability become a primary and urgent one when we face the mass data in the real world. In this paper we will build a food supply chain traceability system for real-time food tracing based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), blockchain and Internet of things, which could provide an information platform for all the supply chain members with openness, transparency, neutrality, reliability and security. Furthermore, we introduce a new concept BigchainDB to fill the gap in the decentralized systems at scale. The paper concludes with a description of a use case and the challenges to adopt blockchain technology in the future food supply chain traceability systems are discussed.

TI Bitcoin blockchain dynamics: The selfish-mine strategy in the presence
   of propagation delay
SO PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
AB In the context of the 'selfish-mine' strategy proposed by Eyal and Sirer, we study the effect of communication delay on the evolution of the Bitcoin blockchain. First, we use a simplified Markov model that tracks the contrasting states of belief about the blockchain of a small pool of dishonest miners and the 'rest of the community' to establish that the use of block-hiding strategies, such as selfish-mine, causes the rate of production of orphan blocks to increase. Then we use a spatial Poisson process model to study values of Eyal and Sirer's parameter gamma, which denotes the proportion of the honest community that mines on a previously-secret block released by the pool in response to the mining of a block by the honest community. Finally, we use discrete-event simulation to study the behaviour of a network of Bitcoin miners, a proportion of which is colluding in using the selfish-mine strategy, under the assumption that there is a delay in the communication of information between miners. The models indicate that both the dishonest and the honest miners were worse off than they would have been if no dishonest mining were present, and that it is possible for the mining community to detect block-hiding behaviour, such as that used in selfish-mine, by monitoring the rate of production of orphan blocks.

AB Bitcoin, a decentralized cryptographic currency that has experienced proliferating popularity over the past few years, is the common denominator in a wide variety of cybercrime. We perform a measurement analysis of CryptoLocker, a family of ransomware that encrypts a victim's files until a ransom is paid, within the Bitcoin ecosystem from September 5, 2013 through January 31, 2014. Using information collected from online fora, such as reddit and BitcoinTalk, as an initial starting point, we generate a cluster of 968 Bitcoin addresses belonging to CryptoLocker. We provide a lower bound for CryptoLocker's economy in Bitcoin and identify 795 ransom payments totalling 1,128.40 BTC ($310,472.38), but show that the proceeds could have been worth upwards of $1.1 million at peak valuation. By analyzing ransom payment timestamps both longitudinally across CryptoLocker's operating period and transversely across times of day, we detect changes in distributions and form conjectures on CryptoLocker that corroborate information from previous efforts. Additionally, we construct a network topology to detail CryptoLocker's financial infrastructure and obtain auxiliary information on the CryptoLocker operation. Most notably, we find evidence that suggests connections to popular Bitcoin services, such as Bitcoin Fog and BTC-e, and subtle links to other cybercrimes surrounding Bitcoin, such as the Sheep Marketplace scam of 2013. We use our study to underscore the value of measurement analyses and threat intelligence in understanding the erratic cybercrime landscape.

TI Social signals and algorithmic trading of Bitcoin
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB The availability of data on digital traces is growing to unprecedented sizes, but inferring actionable knowledge from large-scale data is far from being trivial. This is especially important for computational finance, where digital traces of human behaviour offer a great potential to drive trading strategies. We contribute to this by providing a consistent approach that integrates various datasources in the design of algorithmic traders. This allows us to derive insights into the principles behind the profitability of our trading strategies. We illustrate our approach through the analysis of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency known for its large price fluctuations. In our analysis, we include economic signals of volume and price of exchange for USD, adoption of the Bitcoin technology and transaction volume of Bitcoin. We add social signals related to information search, word of mouth volume, emotional valence and opinion polarization as expressed in tweets related to Bitcoin for more than 3 years. Our analysis reveals that increases in opinion polarization and exchange volume precede rising Bitcoin prices, and that emotional valence precedes opinion polarization and rising exchange volumes. We apply these insights to design algorithmic trading strategies for Bitcoin, reaching very high profits in less than a year. We verify this high profitability with robust statisticalmethods that take into account risk and trading costs, confirming the longstanding hypothesis that trading-based social media sentiment has the potential to yield positive returns on investment.

AB Mixcoin is a Bitcoin mixing protocol proposed by Bonneau et al. which provides strong accountability guarantees [13]. However, in the Mixcoin protocol, the mapping from a user's input to output address is visible to the mixing server. We modify the Mixcoin protocol to provide guarantees that the input/output address mapping for any user is kept hidden from the mixing server. In order to achieve this, we make use of a blind signature scheme [14,23] as well as an append-only public log. The scheme is fully compatible with Bitcoin, forces mixes to be accountable, preserves user anonymity even against a malicious mix, is resilient to denial of service attacks, and easily scales to many users.

TI Blockchain and Smart Contracts for Insurance: Is the Technology Mature
   Enough?
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Blockchain is receiving increasing attention from academy and industry, since it is considered a breakthrough technology that could bring huge benefits to many different sectors. In 2017, Gartner positioned blockchain close to the peak of inflated expectations, acknowledging the enthusiasm for this technology that is now largely discussed by media. In this scenario, the risk to adopt it in the wake of enthusiasm, without objectively judging its actual added value is rather high. Insurance is one the sectors that, among others, started to carefully investigate the possibilities of blockchain. For this specific sector, however, the hype cycle shows that the technology is still in the innovation trigger phase, meaning that the spectrum of possible applications has not been fully explored yet. Insurers, as with many other companies not necessarily active only in the financial sector, are currently requested to make a hard decision, that is, whether to adopt blockchain or not, and they will only know if they were right in 3-5 years. The objective of this paper is to support actors involved in this decision process by illustrating what a blockchain is, analyzing its advantages and disadvantages, as well as discussing several use cases taken from the insurance sector, which could easily be extended to other domains.

SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB This paper looks at the challenges and opportunities of implementing blockchain technology across banking, providing food for thought about the potentialities of this disruptive technology. The blockchain technology can optimize the global financial infrastructure, achieving sustainable development, using more efficient systems than at present. In fact, many banks are currently focusing on blockchain technology to promote economic growth and accelerate the development of green technologies. In order to understand the potential of blockchain technology to support the financial system, we studied the actual performance of the Bitcoin system, also highlighting its major limitations, such as the significant energy consumption due to the high computing power required, and the high cost of hardware. We estimated the electrical power and the hash rate of the Bitcoin network, over time, and, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Bitcoin system in its actual operation, we defined three quantities: "economic efficiency", "operational efficiency", and "efficient service". The obtained results show that by overcoming the disadvantages of the Bitcoin system, and therefore of blockchain technology, we could be able to handle financial processes in a more efficient way than under the current system.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as "miner" that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.

AB eHealth is a technology that is growing in importance over time, varying from remote access to Medical Records, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR), or Electronic Medical Records (EMR), to real-time data exchange from different onbody sensors coming from different patients. With this huge amount of critical data being exchanged, problems and challenges arise. Privacy and confidentiality of this critical medical data are of high concern to the patients and authorized persons to use this data. On the other hand, scalability and interoperability are also important problems that should be considered in the final solution. This paper illustrates the specific problems and highlights the benefits of the blockchain technology for the deployment of a secure and a scalable solution for medical data exchange in order to have the best performance possible.

TI A Hexagonal Covalent Porphyrin Framework as an Efficient Support for
   Gold Nanoparticles toward Catalytic Reduction of 4-Nitrophenol
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB A hexagonal porphyrin-based porous organic polymer, namely, CPF-1, was constructed by 3+2 ketoenamine condensation of the C2-symmetric porphyrin diamine 5,15-bis(4-aminophenyl)-10,20-diphenylporphyrin and 1,3,5-triformylphloroglucinol. This material exhibits permanent porosity and excellent thermal and chemical stability. CPF-1 can be employed as a superior supporting substrate to immobilize Au nanoparticles (NPs) as a result of the strong interactions between Au NPs and the CPF support. An Au@CPF-1 hybrid was synthesized by an interfacial solution infiltration method with NaBH4 as reducing agent. Au NPs (5 nm) grew on CPF-1 and were distributed without aggregation. Moreover, Au@CPF-1 exhibits superior catalytic activity compared to many other reported Au-based catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol in the presence of NaBH4. In addition, Au@CPF-1 has excellent stability and recyclability, and it can be reused for three successive reaction cycles without loss of activity. The dense distribution of phenyl rings on the channel walls of the CPF support can reasonably be regarded as the active sites that adsorb the 4-nitrophenol molecule through hydrogen-bonding and C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions, as was confirmed by the X-ray structure of model compound DAPP-Benz.

AB While threshold signature schemes have been presented before, there has never been an optimal threshold signature algorithm for DSA. The properties of DSA make it quite challenging to build a threshold version. In this paper, we present a threshold DSA scheme that is efficient and optimal. We also present a compelling application to use our scheme: securing Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin thefts are on the rise, and threshold DSA is necessary to secure Bitcoin wallets. Our scheme is the first general threshold DSA scheme that does not require an honest majority and is useful for securing Bitcoin wallets.

AB Current IoT systems tend to be cloud-centric which in turn introduces network latency and constrained interaction with sensors and actuators. This paper presents the idea of using restful micro-services called Virtual Resources. A Virtual Resource is a software-defined IoT management construct that enables multi-tenancy support and load distribution onto edge hosts. The paper presents a performance analysis of our Golang implementation of Virtual Resources in various settings.

TI Intermolecular Interactions and Self-Assembly in Aqueous Solution of a
   Mixture of Anionic-Neutral and Cationic-Neutral Block Copolymers
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB We have investigated the self-assembly in dilute aqueous solutions of a mixture of an anionic-neutral block copolymer (AP) and a cationic-neutral block copolymer (MP) by changing the added sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration C-S or electrostatic interactions among oppositely charged blocks, by direct observation, optical and electron microscopies, and small-angle X-ray scattering. The ratio of the charged to neutral block chain lengths was ca. 10., and the total copolymer concentration and the mixing ratio (the mole fraction of the MP charge unit in the total charge units) of AP and MP were fixed to be 0.005 g/cm(3) and 0.6, respectively. With decreasing C-S from 2 to 0 M, we have found reentrant one-phase, two-phase, one-phase transitions in the aqueous solution of the AP-MP mixture. The two-phase to one-phase transition at C-S similar to 0.5 M arises from the competition between the macroscopic phase transition and micellization, which is the first observation in dilute block copolymer solutions. Moreover, we have found a micelle morphology transition from the bilayer vesicle to the cylindrical micelle with further decreasing C-S from 0.5 M to lower than 0.05 M.

AB The Bitcoin protocol supports optional direct payments from transaction partners to miners. These "fees" are supposed to substitute miners' minting rewards in the long run. Acknowledging their role for the stability of the system, the right level of transaction fees is a hot topic of normative debates. This paper contributes empirical evidence from a historical analysis of agents' revealed behavior concerning their payment of transaction fees. We identify several regime shifts, which can be largely explained by changes in the default client software or actions of big intermediaries in the ecosystem. Overall, it seems that rules dominate ratio, a state that is sustainable only if fees remain negligible.

AB We present the first empirical analysis of Bitcoin-based scams: operations established with fraudulent intent. By amalgamating reports gathered by voluntary vigilantes and tracked in online forums, we identify 192 scams and categorize them \into four groups: Ponzi schemes, mining scams, scam wallets and fraudulent exchanges. In 21% of the cases, we also found the associated Bitcoin addresses, which enables us to track payments into and out of the scams. We find that at least $11 million has been contributed to the scams from 13 000 distinct victims. Furthermore, we present evidence that the most successful scams depend on large contributions from a very small number of victims. Finally, we discuss ways in which the scams could be countered.

TI Polydispersity-Driven Block Copolymer Amphiphile Self-Assembly into
   Prolate-Spheroid Micelles
SO ACS MACRO LETTERS
AB The aqueous self-assembly behavior of polydisperse poly(ethylene oxide-b-1,4-butadiene-b-ethylene oxide) (OBO) macromolecular triblock amphiphiles is examined to discern the implications of continuous polydispersity in the hydrophobic block on the resulting aqueous micellar morphologies of otherwise monodisperse polymer surfactants. The chain length polydispersity and implicit composition polydispersity of these samples furnishes a distribution of preferred interfacial curvatures, resulting in dilute aqueous block copolymer dispersions exhibiting coexisting spherical and rod-like micelles with vesicles in a single sample with a O weight fraction, w(O), of 0.18. At higher w(O) = 0.51-0.68, the peak in the interfacial curvature distribution shifts and we observe the formation of only American football-shaped micelles. We rationalize the formation of these anisotropically shaped aggregates based on the intrinsic distribution of preferred curvatures adopted by the polydisperse copolymer amphiphiles and on the relief of core block chain stretching by chain-length-dependent intramicellar segregation.

TI Impact of different structural types of amylopectin on retrogradation
SO FOOD HYDROCOLLOIDS
AB Retrogradation is the re-association and recrystallization process of glucan chains in gelatinized starch. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of amylopectin structure on re-association of glucan chains during retrogradation. Amylopectin retrogradation of 17 starches from four different structural types was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Gelatinized starches were stored for 10 days at 4 degrees C and then scanned from 10-120 degrees C at 10 degrees C/min. The structural type of amylopectin influenced the transition temperatures (T-m and T-c), melting temperature range (T-c-T-o) and enthalpy change of transition (Delta H). Correlation analysis between different chain length categories and the melting parameters of recrystallized amylopectin revealed a strong correlation of the external chain length (ECL) with T-m (r = 0.90, p < 0.01), T-c (r = 0.95, p < 0.01), T-c-T-o (r = 0.89 p < 0.01), and Delta H (r = 0.89, p < 0.01) showing the importance of the external chains of amylopectin in the recrystallization process. Chains with very short external length (ECL 6-8) showed negative relationship with retrogradation behavior. However, also the inter-block chain length (IB-CL; distance between tightly branched units) showed positive correlation with transition temperatures (T-c: r = 0.96, p < 0.01, T-c-T-o: r = 0.97, p < 0.01), and Delta H (r = 0.91, p < 0.01) suggesting that longer internal chain segments also play an important role, possibly by contributing to a flexible amylopectin structure. The retrogradation behavior of amylopectin types can be systematically interpreted with the backbone model of amylopectin. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bitcoin-based fair payments for outsourcing computations of fog devices
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Fog computing can be viewed as an extension of cloud computing that enables transactions and resources at the edge of the network. In the paradigms of fog computing, the fog user (outsourcer) with resource constraint devices can outsource the distributed computation tasks to the untrusted fog nodes (workers) and pays for them. Recently, plenty of research work has been done on fair payments. However, all existing solutions adopt the traditional e-cash system to generate payment token, which needs a trusted authority (i.e. a bank) to prevent double-spending. The bank will become the bottleneck of the payments system. In this paper, we propose a new fair payment scheme for outsourcing computations based on Bitcoin. Due to the advantages of Bitcoin syntax, the users can transact directly without needing a bank. Besides, the proposed construction can guarantee that no matter how a malicious outsourcer behaves, the honest workers will be paid if he completed the computing tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI A Blockchain-Based Framework for Data Sharing With Fine-Grained Access
   Control in Decentralized Storage Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In traditional cloud storage systems, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is regarded as an important technology for solving the problem of data privacy and fine-grained access control. However, in all ABE schemes, the private key generator has the ability to decrypt all data stored in the cloud server, which may bring serious problems such as key abuse and privacy data leakage. Meanwhile, the traditional cloud storage model runs in a centralized storage manner, so single point of failure may leads to the collapse of system. With the development of blockchain technology, decentralized storage mode has entered the public view. The decentralized storage approach can solve the problem of single point of failure in traditional cloud storage systems and enjoy a number of advantages over centralized storage, such as low price and high throughput. In this paper, we study the data storage and sharing scheme for decentralized storage systems and propose a framework that combines the decentralized storage system interplanetary file system, the Ethereum blockchain, and ABE technology. In this framework, the data owner has the ability to distribute secret key for data users and encrypt shared data by specifying access policy, and the scheme achieves fine-grained access control over data. At the same time, based on smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, the keyword search function on the cipher text of the decentralized storage systems is implemented, which solves the problem that the cloud server may not return all of the results searched or return wrong results in the traditional cloud storage systems. Finally, we simulated the scheme in the Linux system and the Ethereum official test network Rinkeby, and the experimental results show that our scheme is feasible.

TI Enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures for additive manufacturing:
   coupling lanthanide nanomaterial chemical signatures with blockchain
   technology
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C
AB The significant rise of additive manufacturing (AM) in recent years is in part due to the open sourced nature of the printing processes and reduced cost and capital barriers relative to traditional manufacturing. However, this democratization of manufacturing spurs an increased demand for producers and end-users to verify the authenticity and quality of individual parts. To this end, we introduce an anti-counterfeiting method composed of first embedding engineered nanomaterials into features of a 3D-printed part followed by non-destructive interrogation of these features to quantify a chemical signature profile. The part specific chemical signature data is then linked to a securitized, distributed, and time-stamped blockchain ledger entry. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, lanthanide-aspartic acid nanoscale coordination polymers (Ln(3+)-Asp NCs)/poly(lactic) acid (PLA) composites were formulated and transformed into a filament feedstock for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. In the present case, a quick-response (QR) code containing the doped Ln(3+)-Asp NCs was printed using a dual-extruder FDM printer into pure PLA parts. The QR code provides a searchable reference to an Ethereum-based blockchain entry. The QR code physical features also serve as defined areas to probe the signatures arising from the embedded Ln(3+)-Asp NCs. Visible fluorescence emission with UV-excitation was quantified in terms of color using a smartphone camera and incorporated into blockchain entries. Ultimately, linking unique chemical signature data to blockchain databases is anticipated to make the costs of counterfeiting AM materials significantly more prohibitive and transactions between those in the supply chain more trustworthy.

TI Hitching Healthcare to the Chain: An Introduction to Blockchain
   Technology in the Healthcare Sector
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Health services must balance patient care with information privacy, access, and completeness. The massive scale of the healthcare industry also amplifies the importance of cost control. The promise of blockchain technology in health services, combined with application layers built atop it, is to be a mechanism that provides utmost privacy while ensuring that appropriate users can easily add to and access a permanent record of information. Blockchains, also called distributed ledgers, enable a combination of cost reduction and increased accessibility to information by connecting stake-holders directly without requirements for third-party brokers, potentially giving better results at lower costs. New ventures are looking to apply blockchain technology to solve real-world problems, including efforts to track public health, centralize research data, monitor and fulfill prescriptions, lower administrative overheads, and organize patient data from an increasing number of inputs. Here, concrete examples of the application of blockchain technology in the health sector are described, touching on near-term promise and challenges.

TI Rapid and Quantitative Assessment of Redox Conduction Across
   Electroactive Biofilms by using Double Potential Step Chronoamperometry
SO CHEMELECTROCHEM
AB The mechanism of electron transport across electroactive biofilms (EABs) is of high interest and still a matter of debate. Quantitative assessments of their redox conduction take considerable time and require non-turnover conditions (absence of substrate), which can be detrimental to EABs. Here, we measure the charge-transport parameters of Geobacter spp. dominated EABs with double potential step chronoamperometry (DPSC) with Cottrell analysis. The DPSC measurement is simpler and much faster than usual techniques and allows the determination of the charge-transport parameters even under turnover conditions. The electrochemical responses were well-described by a model of redox conduction driven only by electron diffusion within the EAB. The apparent diffusion coefficient for the electron (Dapp) was measured as approximately 3.2 x 10(-7) cm(2) s(-1), a value similar to those recorded for pure Geobacter sulfurreducens EABs, or for some redox polymers with comparable redox center concentrations. This method will be valuable for assessing the impact of EAB characteristics and environmental factors on the charge-transport ability of the biofilm, and for determining the rate-limiting step(s) for current production.

AB Building the Internet of Things requires deploying a huge number of objects with full or limited connectivity to the Internet. Given that these objects are exposed to attackers and generally not secured-by-design, it is essential to be able to update them, to patch their vulnerabilities and to prevent hackers from enrolling them into botnets. Ideally, the update infrastructure should implement the CIA triad properties, i.e., confidentiality, integrity and availability. In this work, we investigate how the use of a blockchain infrastructure can meet these requirements, with a focus on availability. In addition, we propose a peer-to-peer mechanism, to spread updates between objects that have limited access to the Internet. Finally, we give an overview of our ongoing prototype implementation.

SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS
AB This paper is an analysis of the role reputation plays in the Deep Web using data from the Internet black-market site, The Silk Road. This encrypted online marketplace employed cryptocurrency and functioned over the Tor network. Utilizing a modeling technique, informed by trade auction theory, we investigate the effect of seller reputation. Analysis of the seller's reputation gives us insights into the factors that determine the prices of goods and services in this black marketplace. Data on cannabis listings is parsed from the Silk Road website and covers an 11-month time period, from November 2013 to October 2014. This data demonstrates that reputation acts as a sufficient self-enforcement mechanism to allow transactions. These findings exemplify the robustness of spontaneous order with respect to the Deep Web as an emergent marketplace.

AB Existing security mechanisms for managing the Internet infrastructural resources like IP addresses, AS numbers, BGP advertisements and DNS mappings rely on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that can be potentially compromised by state actors and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Ideally the Internet infrastructure needs a distributed and tamper-resistant resource management framework which cannot be subverted by any single entity. A secure, distributed ledger enables such a mechanism and the blockchain is the best known example of distributed ledgers.
   In this paper, we propose the use of a blockchain based mechanism to secure the Internet BGP and DNS infrastructure. While the blockchain has scaling issues to be overcome, the key advantages of such an approach include the elimination of any PKI-like root of trust, a verifiable and distributed transaction history log, multi-signature based authorizations for enhanced security, easy extensibility and scriptable programmability to secure new types of Internet resources and potential for a built in cryptocurrency. A tamper resistant DNS infrastructure also ensures that it is not possible for the application level PKI to spoof HTTPS traffic.

AB While procedural languages are commonly used to program smart contracts in blockchain systems, logic-based languages may be interesting alternatives. In this paper, we inspect what are the possible legal and technical (dis) advantages of logic-based smart contracts in light of common activities featuring ordinary contracts, then we provide insights on how to use such logic-based smart contracts in combination with blockchain systems. These insights lead us to emphasize a fundamental challenge - algorithms for logic approaches have to be efficient, but they also need to be literally cheap as measured within the environment where they are deployed and according to its economic rules. We illustrate this with different algorithms from defeasible logic-based frameworks.

AB After the global financial crisis 2008, the world has been putting more effort in tightening banking and financial activities with stricter regulations. However, the effectiveness of this policy has remained controversial as many people believe that policy makers should promote freedom and transparency by empowering the public to directly interfere and change the system for public interest. This article attempts to synthesize and analyze available information with a focus on the role of blockchain, a financial tool that can potentially play an important role in the sustainable development of the global economy. The new technology is expected to bring massive benefits to consumers, to current banking system and to the whole society in general.

TI Severity of maltreatment and personality pathology in adolescents of
   Jammu, India: A latent class approach
SO CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
AB The aims of the present study were to identify discrete classes of adolescents based on their reporting of emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, and physical neglect of several levels of severity using a person-centered analytic approach (i.e., latent class analysis), and to compare the latent classes on 17 dimensions of personality pathology. It was hypothesized that based on types of maltreatment and severity levels within each type there would be discrete latent classes, and that classes of adolescents exposed to a larger number of maltreatment types with higher severity (i.e., moderate-severe) would report higher levels of personality pathology than adolescents in classes exposed to less types with less severity, after controlling for age and gender. Participants were 702 adolescents from Jammu, India (13-17 years, 41.5% females). The latent classes were based on three levels of severity for each type of maltreatment assessed via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein et al., 2003). Four distinct classes of adolescents, namely, Moderate-severe abuse and physical neglect (Class 1), Low to moderate-severe abuse (Class 2), Moderate-severe neglect (Class 3), and Minimal abuse or neglect (Class 4) were found. Classes with higher percentages of adolescents reporting abuse and neglect with higher severity (Classes 1 and 2) reported higher levels of personality pathology than the other classes. There are distinct classes of adolescents' identifiable based on levels of severity and types of abuse and neglect, which are differentially associated with specific dimensions of personality pathology. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Ripple is a payment system and a digital currency which evolved completely independently of Bitcoin. Although Ripple holds the second highest market cap after Bitcoin, there are surprisingly no studies which analyze the provisions of Ripple.
   In this paper, we study the current deployment of the Ripple payment system. For that purpose, we overview the Ripple protocol and outline its security and privacy provisions in relation to the Bitcoin system. We also discuss the consensus protocol of Ripple. Contrary to the statement of the Ripple designers, we show that the current choice of parameters does not prevent the occurrence of forks in the system. To remedy this problem, we give a necessary and sufficient condition to prevent any fork in the system. Finally, we analyze the current usage patterns and trade dynamics in Ripple by extracting information from the Ripple global ledger. As far as we are aware, this is the first contribution which sheds light on the current deployment of the Ripple system.

To examine the effectiveness of different solutions, we first propose a formal definitional framework for virtual currencies and put forth a new notion of anonymity, taint resistance, that they can satisfy. We then approach the problem from a theoretical angle, by proposing various solutions to achieve provable taint resistance, and from a practical angle, by examining the taint resistance of the Coinjoin protocol.

TI GENDER DIFFERENCES IN A CLINICAL SAMPLE OF PATIENTS WITH BORDERLINE

SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS
AB The aim of the study was to investigate gender differences and similarities in patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) with respect to Axis I comorbidity, Axis II comorbidity, general psychopathology (Symptom Checklist 90-Revised), and dimensional personality traits (NEO-Personality-Inventory Revised [NEO-PI-R] and the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Profile Basic questionnaire [DAPP-BQ]). Fifty-seven men and 114 women with BPD were included in the study. Regarding Axis I and II disorders in an exploratory analysis, men with BPD more often fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder, antisocial personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and conduct disorder in childhood, whereas women had higher frequencies of bulimia nervosa, posttraumatic stress disorder, and panic disorder with agoraphobia. After correcting for multiple tests, only the gender differences in narcissistic and antisocial personality disorder remained significant. In the SCL-90-R profile, no significant gender differences could be identified. In the exploratory analysis of the dimensional personality traits, women showed higher rates on the NEO-PI-R main factors (Neuroticism and Agreeableness) compared to men. In the DAPP-BQ profile, men reached higher sores on the main factor, Dissocial Behavior. When correcting for multiple tests, gender differences still existed for Neuroticism and Dissocial Behavior. Our results argue for gender differences in Axis I and II comorbidity and dimensional personality traits in BPD. However, in general, more similarities than differences were shown in this study.

TI Portfolio diversification with virtual currency: Evidence from bitcoin

AB The paper investigates the proprieties of Bitcoin in the financial markets. Specifically, we explore the conditional cross effects and volatility spillover between Bitcoin and financial indicators using different multivariate GARCH specifications. The nature of interaction between Bitcoin and financial variables and their transmission mechanisms are taken into account when analyzing the diversification and hedging effectiveness across gold asset and stock market. Our findings suggest that all models confirm the significant returns and volatility spillovers. More importantly, we find that VARMA (1,1)-DCC-GJR-GARCH is the best-fit model for modeling the joint dynamics of a variety of financial assets. We also show that a short position in the Bitcoin market allows hedging the risk investment for all different financial assets. Finally, hedging strategies involving gold, oil, equities and Bitcoin reduce considerably the portfolio's risk, as compared to the risk of the portfolio made up of gold, oil and equities only.

Despite astonishing price appreciation in recent years, cryptocurrencies have been subjected to accusations of pricing bubbles central to the trilemma that exists between regulatory oversight, the potential for illicit use through its anonymity within a young under-developed exchange system, and infrastructural breaches influenced by the growth of cybercriminality. Each influences the perception of the role of cryptocurrencies as a credible investment asset class and legitimate of value.

Two different long-memory methods (R/S analysis and fractional integration) are used to analyse it in the case of the four main cryptocurrencies (BitCoin, LiteCoin, Ripple, Dash) over the sample period 2013-2017. The findings indicate that this market exhibits persistence (there is a positive correlation between its past and future values), and that its degree changes over time. Such predictability represents evidence of market inefficiency: trend trading strategies can be used to generate abnormal profits in the cryptocurrency market.

AB Deployment of distributed generation technologies, especially solar photovoltaic, have turned regular consumers into active contributors to the local supply of electricity. This development along with the digitalisation of power distribution grids (smart grids) is setting the scene to a new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading. The design of the features and rules on how to sell or buy electricity locally, however, is in its early stages for microgrids or small communities. Market design research focuses predominantly on established electricity markets and not so much on incentivising local trading. This is partially because concepts of local markets carry distinct features: the diversity and characteristics of distributed generation, the specific rules for local electricity prices, and the role of digitalisation tools to facilitate peer-to-peer trade (e.g. Blockchain). As different local or peer-to-peer energy trading schemes have emerged recently, this paper proposes two market designs centred on the role of electricity storage. That is, we focus on the following questions: What is the value of prosumer batteries in P2P trade?; What market features do battery system configurations need?; and What electricity market design will open the economical potential of end-user batteries? To address these questions, we implement an optimisation model to represent the peer-to-peer interactions in the presence of storage for a small community in London, United Kingdom. We investigate the contribution of batteries located at the customer level versus a central battery shared by the community. Results show that the combined features of trade and flexibility from storage produce savings of up to 31% for the end-users. More than half of the savings comes from cooperation and trading in the community, while the rest is due to battery's flexibility in balancing supply-demand operations.

Tracking and authenticating the food supply chain to understand provenance is critical with a view to identifying and addressing sources of contamination in the food supply chain worldwide. One way of solving traceability issues and ensuring transparency is by using blockchain technology to store data from chemical analysis in chronological order so that they are impossible to manipulate afterwards.

TI Blockchain-Based Data Preservation System for Medical Data
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Medical care has become an indispensable part of people's lives, with a dramatic increase in the volume of medical data (e.g., diagnosis certificates and medical records). Medical data, however, is easily stolen, tampered with, or even completely deleted. If the above occurs, medical data cannot be recorded or retrieved in a reliable manner, resulting in delay treatment progress, even endanger the patient's life. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based data preservation system (DPS) for medical data. To provide a reliable storage solution to ensure the primitiveness and verifiability of stored data while preserving privacy for users, we leverage the blockchain framework. With the proposed DPS, users can preserve important data in perpetuity, and the originality of the data can be verified if tampering is suspected. In addition, we use prudent data storage strategies and a variety of cryptographic algorithms to guarantee user privacy; e.g., an adversary is unable to read the plain text even if the data are stolen. We implement a prototype of the DPS based on the real world blockchain-based platform Ethereum. Performance evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.

TI Towards Secure and Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing in e-Health Systems
   via Consortium Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Electronic health record sharing can help to improve the accuracy of diagnosis, where security and privacy preservation are critical issues in the systems. In recent years, blockchain has been proposed to be a promising solution to achieve personal health information (PHI) sharing with security and privacy preservation due to its advantages of immutability. This work proposes a blockchain-based secure and privacy-preserving PHI sharing (BSPP) scheme for diagnosis improvements in e-Health systems. Firstly, two kinds of blockchains, private blockchain and consortium blockchain, are constructed by devising their data structures, and consensus mechanisms. The private blockchain is responsible for storing the PHI while the consortium blockchain keeps records of the secure indexes of the PHI. In order to achieve data security, access control, privacy preservation and secure search, all the data including the PHI, keywords and the patients' identity are public key encrypted with keyword search. Furthermore, the block generators are required to provide proof of conformance for adding new blocks to the blockchains, which guarantees the system availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can meet with the security goals. Furthermor, we implement the proposed scheme on JUICE to evaluate the performance.

TI Bitcoin returns and transaction activity
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper examines the empirical linkages between Bitcoin returns and transaction activity. Extant literature shows Bitcoin prices may be detached from economic fundamentals. The question that remains however is whether its price movements are linked with its transaction activity - a critical element of its growing market microstructure. Using number of Bitcoin transactions and unique addresses, respectively, to proxy for transaction activity, it is shown that a one standard deviation shock to transaction activity leads to just over a 0.30% gain in returns on the third day following the shock. By the sixth day, there is a reversal in price behavior and any such gams are expunged. When comparing the bidirectional linkages between returns and transaction activity, it is shown here that the contribution of return shocks to transaction activity is quantitatively larger in magnitude.

TI Secure Authentication-Management human-centric Scheme for trusting
   personal resource information on mobile cloud computing with blockchain
SO HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The recent advances in information technology for mobile devices have increased the work efficiency of users, the mobility of compact mobile devices, and the convenience of location independence. However, mobile devices have limited computing power and storage capacity, so mobile cloud computing is being researched to overcome these limitations in mobile devices. Mobile cloud computing is divided into two methods: the use of external cloud services and the use of mobile resource management without a cloud server (MRM), which integrates the computing and storage resources of nearby mobile devices. Because mobile devices can freely participate in MRM, it is critical to have authentication technology to determine the correctness of information regarding resources. Conventional technologies require strong authentication techniques because they have vulnerabilities that can easily be tampered with via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This paper proposes the Secure Authentication Management human-centric Scheme (SAMS) to authenticate mobile devices using blockchain for trusting resource information in the mobile devices that are participating in the MRM resource pool. The SAMS forms a blockchain based on the resource information of the subordinate client nodes around the master node in the MRM. Devices in the MRM that have not been authorized through the SAMS cannot access or falsify data. To verify the SAMS for application with MRM, it was tested for data falsification by a malicious user accessing the SAMS, and the results show that data falsification is impossible.

TI A Distributed Ledger for Supply Chain Physical Distribution Visibility
SO INFORMATION
AB Supply chains (SC) span many geographies, modes and industries and involve several phases where data flows in both directions from suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, to customers. This data flow is necessary to support critical business decisions that may impact product cost and market share. Current SC information systems are unable to provide validated, pseudo real-time shipment tracking during the distribution phase. This information is available from a single source, often the carrier, and is shared with other stakeholders on an as-needed basis. This paper introduces an independent, crowd-validated, online shipment tracking framework that complements current enterprise-based SC management solutions. The proposed framework consists of a set of private distributed ledgers and a single blockchain public ledger. Each private ledger allows the private sharing of custody events among the trading partners in a given shipment. Privacy is necessary, for example, when trading high-end products or chemical and pharmaceutical products. The second type of ledger is a blockchain public ledger. It consists of the hash code of each private event in addition to monitoring events. The latter provide an independently validated immutable record of the pseudo real-time geolocation status of the shipment from a large number of sources using commuters-sourcing.

TI Contract law 2.0: 'Smart' contracts as the beginning of the end of
   classic contract law
SO INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY LAW
AB The paper analyzes legal issues associated with the application of existing contract law provisions to so-called Smart contracts, defined in the paper as 'agreements existing in the form of software code implemented on the Blockchain platform, which ensures the autonomy and self-executive nature of Smart contract terms based on a predetermined set of factors'. The paper consists of several sections. In the second section, the paper outlines the peculiarities of Blockchain technology, as currently implemented in Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which forms the core of Smart contracts. In the third section, the main characteristic features of Smart contracts are described. Finally, the paper outlines key tensions between classic contract law and Smart contracts. The concluding section sets the core question for analysis of the perspectives of implementation of this technology by governments: 'How to align the powers of the government with Blockchain if there is no central authority but only distributed technologies'. The author suggests two solutions, neither of which is optimal: (1) providing the state authorities with the status of a Superuser with extra powers; and (2) relying on traditional remedies and enforcement practices, by pursuing specific individuals - parties to a Smart contract - in offline mode.

AB While Blockchain network brings tremendous benefits, there are concerns whether their performance would match up with the mainstream IT systems. This paper aims to investigate whether the consensus process using Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) could be a performance bottleneck for networks with a large number of peers. We model the PBFT consensus process using Stochastic Reward Nets (SRN) to compute the mean time to complete consensus for networks up to 100 peers. We create a blockchain network using IBM Bluemix service, running a production-grade IoT application and use the data to parameterize and validate our models. We also conduct sensitivity analysis over a variety of system parameters and examine the performance of larger networks.

TI What drives Bitcoin price?
SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB The cryptocurrencies increased in popularity and have become nowadays well known to a wide audience. This article seeks to assess the issue of Bitcoin price formation from a novel perspective. We use a new technique called Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with which a complicated data set can be disentangled into a small number of independent and concretely implicational intrinsic modes that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. Even though Bitcoin is usually labelled as a purely speculative asset, EMD views that it is extremely driven by long-term fundamentals (above one year).

TI eContractual choreography-language properties towards
   cross-organizational business collaboration
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS
AB Meaningfully automating sociotechnical business collaboration promises efficiency-, effectiveness-, and quality increases for realizing next-generation decentralized autonomous organizations. For automating business-process aware cross-organizational operations, the development of existing choreography languages is technology driven and focuses less on sociotechnical suitability and expressiveness concepts and properties that recognize the interaction between people in organizations and technology in workplaces. This gap our suitability-and expressiveness exploration fills by means of a cross-organizational collaboration ontology that we map as a proof-of-concept evaluation to the eSourcing Markup Language (eSML). The latter we test in a feasibility case study to meaningfully support the automation of business collaboration. The developed eSourcing ontology and eSML is replicable for exploring strengths and weaknesses of other choreography languages.

AB Bitcoin has become increasingly important in recent years. The exchange rate raised from $14 in January 2013 up to $240 in April 2013 and even $900 in early 2014. In this paper, we present novel insights about Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) network with a special focus on its distribution among distinct autonomous systems. We traversed Bitcoin's P2P network in a protocol-compliant manner and collected information about the network size, the number of clients, and the network distribution among autonomous systems. Our findings lead to conclusions about the resilience of the Bitcoin ecosystem, the unambiguousness of the blockchain in use, and the propagation and verification of transaction blocks.

TI Block phosphorus-containing poly(trimethylene terephthalate) copolyester
   via solid-state polymerization: retarded crystallization and melting
   behaviour
SO CRYSTENGCOMM
AB The crystallization behavior of neat PTT and phosphorus-containing PTT copolyester with specific block chain structure (PTTDs, obtained by solid-state polymerization (SSP)) has been investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized microscopy (POM) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The overall crystallization kinetics study shows that crystallization is retarded with introduction of a phosphorus-containing segment. This retardation effect is obvious for PTTD10; however, no greater retardation can be observed with further increasing the phosphorus content, which is attributed to the hindering effect of phosphorus-containing segment and specific chain structure, and is in accordance with the crystallization morphology. The crystallization rate of PTTDs is much lower at high crystallization temperature than that of PTT, which can be explained by the diluent effect of the non-crystallizable chain segment. The result of spherulite growth is in accordance with DSC study. The rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) is also calculated, which increases with increasing phosphorus content, suggesting that RAF is not the main factor for retarded crystallization. The main factors of retarded crystallization are probably caused by the diluent effect and the hindering effect of the specific chain structure. With incorporation of phosphorus-containing segments, the transition temperature is slightly changed; however, the equilibrium melting temperature (T-m(0)) of the copolyester decreases. The phosphorus-containing segment plays the role of nucleation agent at regime III.

On the one hand, we observe that Bitcoin has become more efficient over time in relation to its own events. On the other hand, Bitcoin is not affected by monetary policy news, highlighting the absence of any kind of control on Bitcoin. These findings are relevant for investors and policymakers since Bitcoin is a financial asset without any connection to the measures of central banks.

TI Scaling properties of extreme price fluctuations in Bitcoin markets
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Detection of power-law behavior and studies of scaling exponents uncover the characteristics of complexity in many real world phenomena. The complexity of financial markets has always presented challenging issues and provided interesting findings, such as the inverse cubic law in the tails of stock price fluctuation distributions. Motivated by the rise of novel digital assets based on blockchain technology, we study the distributions of cryptocurrency price fluctuations. We consider Bitcoin returns over various time intervals and from multiple digital exchanges, in order to investigate the existence of universal scaling behavior in the tails, and ascertain whether the scaling exponent supports the presence of a finite second moment. We provide empirical evidence on slowly decaying tails in the distributions of returns over multiple time intervals and different exchanges, corresponding to a power-law. We estimate the scaling exponent and find an asymptotic power-law behavior with 2 < alpha < 2.5 suggesting that Bitcoin returns, in addition to being more volatile, also exhibit heavier tails than stocks, which are known to be around 3. Our results also imply the existence of a finite second moment, thus providing a fundamental basis for the usage of standard financial theories and covariance-based techniques in risk management and portfolio optimization scenarios.

TI A Systematic Review of the Use of Blockchain in Healthcare
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Blockchain technology enables a decentralized and distributed environment with no need for a central authority. Transactions are simultaneously secure and trustworthy due to the use of cryptographic principles. In recent years, blockchain technology has become very trendy and penetrated different domains, mostly due to the popularity of cryptocurrencies. One field where blockchain technology has tremendous potential is healthcare, due to the need for a more patient-centric approach to healthcare systems and to connect disparate systems and increase the accuracy of electronic healthcare records (EHRs). In this systematic review, an analysis of state-of-the-art blockchain research in the field of healthcare is conducted. The aim is to reveal the potential applications of the technology and to highlight the challenges and possible directions of blockchain research in healthcare. First, background information is discussed, followed by a description of the exact methodology used in this paper. Next, an analysis of the results is given, which includes a bibliometric overview, an analysis of gathered data and its properties, and the results of a literature quality assessment. Lastly, there is a discussion of the results from the analysis. The findings indicate that blockchain technology research in healthcare is increasing and it is mostly used for data sharing, managing health records and access control. Other scenarios are very rare. Most research is aimed at presenting novel structural designs in the form of frameworks, architectures or models. Findings also show that technical details about the used blockchain elements are not given in most of the analyzed publications and that most research does not present any prototype implementation or implementation details. Often even with a prototype implementation, no details about blockchain elements are given.

TI Cryptocurrencies and Business Ethics
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, SETLcoin, Ether, Solar Coin, or Liberty Reserve exist since 2009. Because of their decentralized control, they are often considered a threat or alternative to the conventional centralized banking system. While the technological implication of some such currencies, especially of Bitcoin, has attracted much attention, so far there is little discussion about the entire field of cryptocurrencies and very little academic literature addressing its ethical significance. In this article, we thus address the impact of blockchain technology on the nature of financial transactions from a business ethics perspective. We begin with a survey on relevant literature from neighboring disciplines. Next, we work towards a 3x3 framework for current debates on the ethics of cryptocurrencies (see Table1): we combine the micro, meso, and macro levels of business and society with assessments of the potential ethical impact of cryptocurrencies as morally beneficial, detrimental, and ambiguous. In addition, we highlight possible avenues for future research, such as the changing roles of the miners and regulators, the prosocial use of cryptocurrencies, the antisocial use for shadow banking and transactions in the dark net' and cryptocurrencies' effect on inflation and deflation.

TI Blockchains and the economic institutions of capitalism
SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS
AB Blockchains are a new digital technology that combines peer-to-peer network computing and cryptography to create an immutable decentralised public ledger. Where the ledger records money, a blockchain is a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin; but ledger entries can record any data structure, including property titles, identity and certification, contracts, and so on. We argue that the economics of blockchains extend beyond analysis of a new general purpose technology and its disruptive Schumpeterian consequences to the broader idea that blockchains are an institutional technology. We consider several examples of blockchain-based economic coordination and governance. We claim that blockchains are an instance of institutional evolution.

AB To achieve confidentiality, authentication, integrity of medical data, and support fine-grained access control, we propose a secure electronic health record (EHR) system based on attribute-based cryptosystem and blockchain technology. In our system, we use attribute-based encryption (ABE) and identity-based encryption (IBE) to encrypt medical data, and use identity-based signature (IBS) to implement digital signatures. To achieve different functions of ABE, IBE and IBS in one cryptosystem, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called combined attribute-based/identity-based encryption and signature (C-AB/IB-ES). This greatly facilitates the management of the system, and does not need to introduce different cryptographic systems for different security requirements. In addition, we use blockchain techniques to ensure the integrity and traceability of medical data. Finally, we give a demonstrating application for medical insurance scene.

TI Copyright in the blockchain era: Promises and challenges
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB The paper focuses on various legal-related aspects of the application of blockchain technologies in the copyright sphere. Specifically, it outlines the existing challenges for distribution of copyrighted works in the digital environment, how they can be solved with blockchain, and what associated issues need to be addressed in this regard. It is argued that blockchain can introduce long-awaited transparency in matters of copyright ownership chain; substantially mitigate risks of online piracy by enabling control over digital copy and creating a civilized market for "used" digital content. It also allows to combine the simplicity of application of creative commons/open source type of licenses with revenue streams, and thus facilitate fair compensation of authors by means of cryptocurrency payments and Smart contracts. However, these benefits do not come without a price: many new issues will need to be resolved to enable the potential of blockchain technologies. Among them are: where to store copyrighted content (on blockchain or "off-chain") and the associated need to adjust the legal status of online intermediaries; how to find a right balance between immutable nature of blockchain records and the necessity to adjust them due to the very nature of copyright law, which assigns ownership based on a set of informal facts, not visible to the public. Blockchain as a kind of time stamping service cannot itself ensure the trustworthiness of facts, which originate "off-chain". More work needs to be done on the legal side: special provisions aimed at facilitating user's trust in blockchain records and their good faith usage of copyrighted works based on them need to be introduced and transactions with cryptocurrencies have to be legalized as well as the status of Smart contracts and their legal consequences. Finally, the economics of blockchain copyright management systems need to be carefully considered in order to ensure that they will have necessary network effects. If those issues are resolved in a satisfactory way, blockchain has the potential to rewrite how the copyright industry functions and digital content is distributed. (C) 2017 Alexander Savelyev.

We combined the traditional GARCH model with the machine learning approach to volatility estimation, estimating the mean and volatility equations using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and comparing to GARCH family models. Furthermore, the models' predictive ability was evaluated using Diebold-Mariano test and Hansen's Model Confidence Set. The analysis was reiterated for both low and high frequency data. Results showed that SVR-GARCH models managed to outperform GARCH, EGARCH and GJR-GARCH models with Normal, Student's t and Skewed Student's t distributions. For all variables and both time frequencies, the SVR-GARCH model exhibited statistical significance towards its superiority over GARCH and its extensions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   volatility
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB We investigate the nonlinear patterns of volatility in seven Bitcoin markets. In particular, we explore the fractional long-range dependence in conjunction with the potential inherent stochasticity of volatility time series under four diverse distributional assumptions, i.e., Normal, Student-t, Generalized Error (GED), and t-Skewed distribution. Our empirical findings signify the existence of long-range memory in Bitcoin market volatility, irrespectively of distributional inference. The same applies to entropy measurement, which indicates a high degree of randomness in the estimated series. As Bitcoin markets are highly disordered and risky, they cannot be considered suitable for hedging purposes. Our results provide strong evidence against the efficient market hypothesis.

TI GARCH Modelling of Cryptocurrencies
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB With the exception of Bitcoin, there appears to be little or no literature on GARCH modelling of cryptocurrencies. This paper provides the first GARCH modelling of the seven most popular cryptocurrencies. Twelve GARCH models are fitted to each cryptocurrency, and their fits are assessed in terms of five criteria. Conclusions are drawn on the best fitting models, forecasts and acceptability of value at risk estimates.

TI Is a 'smart contract' really a smart idea? Insights from a legal
   perspective
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB Swift developments in the emerging field of blockchain technology have facilitated the birth of 'smart contracts': computerised transaction protocols which autonomously execute the terms of a contract. Smart contracts are disintermediated and generally transparent in nature, offering the promise of increased commercial efficiency, lower transaction and legal costs, and anonymous transacting. The business world is actively investigating the use of blockchain technology for various commercial purposes. Whilst questions surround the security and reliability of this technology, and the negative impact it may have upon traditional intermediaries, there are equally significant concerns that smart contracts will encounter considerable difficulty adapting to current legal frameworks regulating contracts across jurisdictions. This article considers the potential issues with legal and practical enforceability that arise from the use of smart contracts within both civil and common law jurisdictions.

TI SMART CONTRACTS AND THE COST OF INFLEXIBILITY
SO UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA LAW REVIEW
AB "Smart contracts" are decentralized agreements built in computer code and stored on a blockchain. Proponents imagine a future where commerce takes place exclusively using smart contracts, avoiding the high costs of contract drafting, judicial intervention, opportunistic behavior, and the inherent ambiguities of written language.
   These decentralized code-only contracts are part of a decades-long quest to eliminate supposed inefficiencies in traditional written agreements. Electronic data interchange (EDI), a contracting technology from the 1970s, was designed with the same goal and garnered similar fanfare. Commentators at the time imagined a revolution in the way firms transacted and a full shift away from anything resembling a paper contract. Ultimately EDI failed to achieve these goals-it empowered, rather than circumvented, human decisionmakers along with their "inefficient" way of forming agreements. In doing so, EDI successfully reduced some transaction costs while preserving efficient forms of contractual flexibility.
   Smart contracts are indeed more technologically sophisticated than EDI. Smart contract scripting languages offer a broader range of operations and greater scalability. Smart contracts are capable of seamlessly integrating with the operational and financial systems at the core of modern firms, whereas EDI transactions occurred in very early digital environments that required human intermediaries. Proponents of the smart contract revolution, therefore, do not describe the technology as a way to merely enhance human activity; they argue it can replace every stage of agreement formation and performance. From a purely technical standpoint, they might be right.
   However, shifting away from human-language contracts creates new inefficiencies. These stem from three features of smart contracts: automation, which requires that every agreement be formed from fully-defined terms; decentralization, which conditions performance on verification by third parties; and anonymity, which eliminates the use of commercial context to give meaning to agreement terms. As a result, it is extremely costly to form smart contracts in a volatile environment or whenever there's a level of uncertainty surrounding the agreement.
   On the other hand, semantic contracts are flexible. They enable parties to use performance standards, generally-defined contract terms, to create an enforceable agreement without requiring complete knowledge of what might happen in the future. Standards also allow parties to responsively incorporate commercial customs into their agreement, circumventing the need for explicit but redundant negotiation. And once their agreement is formed and executed, the parties are nonetheless free to dynamically shape their relationship through informal modifications or by selectively enforcing breaches. These two forms of flexibility-linguistic ambiguity, and enforcement discretion-create important efficiencies in the contracting process. By eliminating this flexibility, smart contracting will impose costs that are more severe and intractable than the ones it seeks to solve.

TI Identifying potentially disruptive trends by means of keyword network
   analysis
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Identifying potentially disruptive technologies is crucial to safeguarding competitive advantage by enabling stakeholders to assign resources in a manner that increases the chances of exploiting the disruption and/or mitigating the ensuing risks. However, disruptive technologies and emergent trends within known disruptive domains are mostly identified ex-post. This paper contributes to the ex-ante prediction of emergent technologies within disruptive domains by proposing a literature-driven method for the forecasting of potentially disruptive technological trends. It adopts a keyword network analysis and visualisation approach for uncovering emergent thematic, structural and temporal developments within publications and applies it as a forecasting tool to an empirical study of seven disruptive domains: 3D Printing, Big Data, Bitcoin, Cloud Technologies, Internet of Things, MOOCs and Social Media. Maturing trends were found to share influential common topics identified by high degree, betweenness and closeness centrality scores. Niche and potentially emerging trends within groups were detected by means of eccentricity and farness metrics. Visualisation techniques were found effective for further clarification and trend identification. Finally, potentially disruptive trends within domains were found to be associated with high closeness paired with low degree centrality. The findings were distilled into a framework for assisting the forecasting of potentially disruptive trends. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI A STATISTICAL RISK ASSESSMENT OF BITCOIN AND ITS EXTREME TAIL BEHAVIOR
SO ANNALS OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB We provide an extreme value analysis of the returns of Bitcoin. A particular focus is on the tail risk characteristics and we will provide an in-depth univariate extreme value analysis. Those properties will be compared to the traditional exchange rates of the G10 currencies versus the US dollar. For investors, especially institutional ones, an understanding of the risk characteristics is of utmost importance. So for Bitcoin to become a mainstream investable asset class, studying these properties is necessary. Our findings show that the bitcoin return distribution not only exhibits higher volatility than traditional G10 currencies, but also stronger non-normal characteristics and heavier tails. This has implications for risk management, financial engineering (such as bitcoin derivatives) - both from an investor's as well as from a regulator's point of view. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed study looking at the extreme value behavior of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.

AB The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in use today on the Internet to secure communications has several drawbacks arising from its centralised and non-transparent design. In the past there has been instances of certificate authorities publishing rogue certificates for targeted attacks, and this has been difficult to immediately detect as certificate authorities are not transparent about the certificates they issue. Furthermore, the centralised selection of trusted certificate authorities by operating system and browser vendors means that it is not practical to untrust certificate authorities that have issued rogue certificates, as this would disrupt the TLS process for many other hosts.
   SCPKI is an alternative PKI system based on a decentralised and transparent design using a web-of-trust model and a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, to make it easily possible for rogue certificates to be detected when they are published. The web-of-trust model is designed such that an entity or authority in the system can verify (or vouch for) fine-grained attributes of another entity's identity (such as company name or domain name), as an alternative to the centralised certificate authority identity verification model.

AB Smart contracts are full-fledged programs that run on blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains). In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gascostly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5%, 90.1% and 80% contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.

AB Blockchain technology enables distributed, encrypted and secure logging of digital transactions. It is the underlying technology of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is expected to revolutionize computing in several areas, particularly where centralization was unnatural and privacy was important. In the paper, we present research on where and how this technology could be useful in the construction industry. The work is based on the study of literature on open issues that exist in construction process management. These are than matched to the capabilities of blockchain.
   We are motivated by the fact that construction projects involve a dynamic grouping of several companies. We study the degree to which the relationships among them are hierarchical or peer-to-peer and note that particularly in information intensive phases, centralization of information management was necessary because of technology. When using un-constraining technology, communication patterns among participants show a peer-to-peer nature of the relationships. In such environment, blockchain can provide a trustworthy infrastructure for information management during all building life-cycle stages. Even if building information modelling (BIM) is used, which assumes a centralized building information model, there is a role for blockchain to manage information on who did what and when and thus provide a basis for any legal arguments that might occur. On the construction site blockchain can improve the reliability and trustworthiness of construction logbooks, works performed and material quantities recorded. In the facility maintenance phase, blockchain's main potential is the secure storage of sensor data which are sensitive to privacy.
   We conclude that blockchain provides solutions to many current problems in construction information management. However, it is more likely that it will be built into generic IT infrastructure on top of which construction applications are built, rather than used directly by authors of construction related software. It has a potential to make construction processes less centralized which opens needs for research in that direction.

SO JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
AB Fixed carrier membranes containing amino groups show attractive performance in CO2 separation for clean energy supply and greenhouse gas reduction. However, the separation performance of fixed carrier membranes at high feed pressure is limited by the facilitated transport ability of membranes as well as the CO2-induced plasticization. In this work, the tertiary amino group containing fixed carrier membranes were prepared by interfacial polymerization (IF) with hexane soluble trimesoyl chloride (TMC) and aqueous soluble 1,4-bis (3-aminopropyl) piperazine (DAPP), N-aminoethyl pipe wine (EAP) and 3,35cliamino-N-meLhylclipropylamine (DNMDAm). The results show that the membrane prepared with TMC and DAPP exhibits the highest CO2 separation performance clue to efficient CO2 facilitated transport and high plasticization resistance. Efficient facilitated transport of CO2 in the membrane is due to the high content of cyclic tertiary amino groups which possess high stoichiometric CO2 loading and high rate constant of amine-CO2 reaction. Moreover, high plasticization resistance of the membrane is attributed to the appropriate stiffness of polymer chains provided by IF The membrane prepared with TMC and DAPP shows promising applications in high-pressure fuel gas purification.

AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are establishing themselves as an investment asset and are often named the New Gold. This study, however, shows that the two assets could barely be more different. Firstly, we analyze and compare conditional variance properties of Bitcoin and Gold as well as other assets and find differences in their structure. Secondly, we implement a BEKK-GARCH model to estimate time-varying conditional correlations. Gold plays an important role in financial markets with flight-to-quality in times of market distress. Our results show that Bitcoin behaves as the exact opposite and it positively correlates with downward markets. Lastly, we analyze the properties of Bitcoin as portfolio component and find no evidence for stable hedging capabilities. We conclude that Bitcoin and Gold feature fundamentally different properties as assets and linkages to equity markets. Our results hold for the broad cryptocurrency index CRIX. As of now, Bitcoin does not reflect any distinctive properties of Gold other than asymmetric response in variance.

They are stored in different hospitals' databases, even for the same patient. Therefore, it is difficult to construct a summarized EMR for one patient from multiple hospital databases due to the security and privacy concerns. Meanwhile, current EMRs systems lack a standard data management and sharing policy, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to develop precise medicines based on data obtained under different policies. To solve the above problems, we proposed a blockchain-based information management system, MedBlock, to handle patients' information. In this scheme, the distributed ledger of MedBlock allows the efficient EMRs access and EMRs retrieval. The improved consensus mechanism achieves consensus of EMRs without large energy consumption and network congestion. In addition, MedBlock also exhibits high information security combining the customized access control protocols and symmetric cryptography. MedBlock can play an important role in the sensitive medical information sharing.

TI Is Bitcoin a hedge, a safe haven or a diversifier for oil price
   movements? A comparison with gold
SO ENERGY ECONOMICS
AB This study assesses the roles of Bitcoin as a hedge, a safe haven and/or a diversifier against extreme oil price movements, in comparison to the corresponding roles of gold. We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture the dependence structure between the considered market returns under different Bitcoin market conditions, while considering nuances of oil price movements, compared to gold. Our findings show that both Bitcoin and gold would serve the roles of a hedge, a safe haven and a diversifier for oil price movements. However, this property seems to be sensitive to the Bitcoin's and gold's different (bear, normal or bull) market conditions and to whether the oil price is in a downside, normal or upside regime. By controlling for new and relevant U.S. and global uncertainty indicators, we confirm that both Bitcoin and gold, but not oil, are assets where investors may park their cash during times of political and economic turmoil. The conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) approach to risk management is then conducted, providing robust evidence of the usefulness of each of the Bitcoin and gold in expanded oil portfolios, in terms of diversification opportunities and downside risk reductions.

TI Quantum-secured blockchain
SO QUANTUM SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Blockchain is a distributed database which is cryptographically protected against malicious modifications. While promising for a wide range of applications, current blockchain platforms rely on digital signatures, which are vulnerable to attacks by means of quantum computers. The same, albeit to a lesser extent, applies to cryptographic hash functions that are used in preparing new blocks, so parties with access to quantum computation would have unfair advantage in procuring mining rewards. Here we propose a possible solution to the quantum era blockchain challenge and report an experimental realization of a quantum-safe blockchain platform that utilizes quantum key distribution across an urban fiber network for information-theoretically secure authentication. These results address important questions about realizability and scalability of quantum-safe blockchains for commercial and governmental applications.

However, there are ongoing efforts to apply blockchain to other fields where trust and value are essential. In this paper, we suggest Gcoin blockchain as the base of the data flow of drugs to create transparent drug transaction data. Additionally, the regulation model of the drug supply chain could be altered from the inspection and examination only model to the surveillance net model, and every unit that is involved in the drug supply chain would be able to participate simultaneously to prevent counterfeit drugs and to protect public health, including patients.

TI Ransomware threat success factors, taxonomy, and countermeasures: A
   survey and research directions
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Ransomware is a malware category that exploits security mechanisms such as cryptography in order to hijack user files and related resources and demands money in exchange for the locked data. Therefore, ransomware has become a lucrative business that has gained increasing popularity among attackers. Unlike traditional malware, even after removal, ransomware's effect is irreversible and difficult to mitigate without the help of its creator. In addition to the downtime costs and the money that individuals and business entities could pay as a ransom, those victims could incur other damage such as loss of data, reputation, and life. To date, several studies have been conducted to address this unique, challenging threat and have tried to provide detection and prevention solutions. However, there is a lack of survey articles that explore the research endeavors in ransomware and highlight the challenges and issues faced by existing solutions. This survey fills the gap and provides a holistic state-of-the-art review of the research on ransomware and its detection and prevention techniques. The survey puts forward a novel ransomware taxonomy, from several perspectives. It then elaborates on the factors that lead to a successful ransomware attacks before discussing in detail the research into counteracting ransomware, including analysis, prevention, detection and prediction solutions. The survey concludes with a brief discussion on the open issues and potential research directions in the near future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Blockchain is gaining traction and can be termed as one of the furthermost prevalent topics nowadays. Although critics question about its scalability, security, and sustainability, it has already transformed many individuals' lifestyle in some areas due to its inordinate influence on industries and businesses. Granting that the features of blockchain technology guarantee more reliable and expedient services, it is important to consider the security and privacy issues and challenges behind the innovative technology. The spectrum of blockchain applications range from financial, healthcare, automobile, risk management, Internet of things (IoT) to public and social services. Several studies focus on utilizing the blockchain data structure in various applications. However, a comprehensive survey on technical and applications perspective has not yet been accomplished. In this paper, we try to conduct a comprehensive survey on the blockchain technology by discussing its structure to different consensus algorithms as well as the challenges and opportunities from the prospective of security and privacy of data in blockchains. Furthermore, we delve into future trends the blockchain technology can adapt in the years to come.

TI Privacy-preserving blockchain-based electric vehicle charging with
   dynamic tariff decisions
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE-RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Electric vehicles are gaining widespread adoption and are a key component in the establishment of the smart grid. Beside the increasing number of electric vehicles, a dense and widespread charging infrastructure will be required. This offers the opportunity for a broad range of different energy providers and charging station operators, both of which can offer energy at different prices depending on demand and supply. While customers benefit from a liberalized market and a wide selection of tariff options, such dynamic pricing use cases are subject to privacy issues and allow to detect the customer's position and to track vehicles for, e.g., targeted advertisements. In this paper we present a reliable, automated and privacy-preserving selection of charging stations based on pricing and the distance to the electric vehicle. The protocol builds on a blockchain where electric vehicles signal their demand and charging stations send bids similar to an auction. The electric vehicle owner then decides on a particular charging station based on the supply-side offers it receives. This paper shows that the use of blockchains increases the reliability and the transparency of this approach while preserving the privacy of the electric vehicle owners.

SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly a reality today. Nevertheless, some key challenges still need to be given particular attention so that IoT solutions further support the growing demand for connected devices and the services offered. Due to the potential relevance and sensitivity of services, IoT solutions should address the security and privacy concerns surrounding these devices and the data they collect, generate, and process. Recently, the Blockchain technology has gained much attention in IoT solutions. Its primary usage scenarios are in the financial domain, where Blockchain creates a promising applications world and can be leveraged to solve security and privacy issues. However, this emerging technology has a great potential in the most diverse technological areas and can significantly help achieve the Internet of Things view in different aspects, increasing the capacity of decentralization, facilitating interactions, enabling new transactionmodels, and allowing autonomous coordination of the devices. The paper goal is to provide the concepts about the structure and operation of Blockchain and, mainly, analyze how the use of this technology can be used to provide security and privacy in IoT. Finally, we present the stalker, which is a selfish miner variant that has the objective of preventing a node to publish its blocks on the main chain.

AB Blockchain is being praised as a technological innovation which allows to revolutionize how society trades and interacts. This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency.
   In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases - Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.

TI Bitcoin and the bailout
SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB On March 16, 2013, Cyprus announced that it would accept a bailout that required imposing a one-time levy on bank deposits. It has been argued that, by making traditional deposit accounts seem less secure, the bailout announcement prompted some to consider-or reconsider-using the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Relying on rank data for a subset of apps, existing studies maintain that interest in bitcoin increased following the announcement, especially in countries with troubled banks. We argue that (1) focusing on a subset of apps does not allow one to distinguish a general increase in the demand for bitcoin apps from a substitution between bitcoin apps and (2) changes in rank data are a poor predictor of changes in the number of downloads. In order to address these concerns, we collect rank data for all fifteen bitcoin apps available at the time and use an established technique to estimate an index of downloads for each country considered. We find that, while downloads of bitcoin apps increased following the announcement, the observed effect was not especially pronounced in countries thought to have had troubled banking systems at the time.

TI Disrupting governance with blockchains and smart contracts
SO STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB Blockchain as an engine for auto-enforceable smart contracts could disrupt traditional governance structures by reducing bureaucracy through lower transaction costs, solving principal-agent issues, and subsequent moral hazard. While machine consensus can radically reduce transaction costs and disrupt traditional governance structures, there is a gap between initial conceptualizations of blockchains and their first instantiations. First use cases show that as circumstances change, protocols can become inappropriate for the new environment and require modification. Modification of blockchain code happens through majority consensus, but reaching consensus in a distributed multi-stakeholder network with sometimes unaligned interests is complex, potentially introducing new agency issues.

Blockchain which is a decentralised transaction and data management technology, has attracted increasing interests from both academic and industrial aspects since 2008. However, most of the existing research and practices are focused on the blockchain itself (i.e. technical challenges and limitations) or its applications in the finance service sector (i.e. Bitcoin). This paper aims to investigate the potential of applying blockchain technology in the construction sector. Three types of blockchain-enabled applications are proposed to improve the current processes of contract management, supply chain management, and equipment leasing, respectively. Challenges of blockchain implementation are also discussed in this paper.

AB In the Bitcoin system, participants are rewarded for solving cryptographic puzzles. In order to receive more consistent rewards over time, some participants organize mining pools and split the rewards from the pool in proportion to each participant's contribution. However, several attacks threaten the ability to participate in pools. The block withholding (BWH) attack makes the pool reward system unfair by letting malicious participants receive unearned wages while only pretending to contribute work. When two pools launch BWH attacks against each other, they encounter the miner's dilemma: in a Nash equilibrium, the revenue of both pools is diminished. In another attack called selfish mining, an attacker can unfairly earn extra rewards by deliberately generating forks.
   In this paper, we propose a novel attack called a fork after withholding (FAW) attack. FAW is not just another attack. The reward for an FAW attacker is always equal to or greater than that for a BWH attacker, and it is usable up to four times more often per pool than in BWH attack. When considering multiple pools - the current state of the Bitcoin network - the extra reward for an FAW attack is about 56% more than that for a BWH attack. Furthermore, when two pools execute FAW attacks on each other, the miner's dilemma may not hold: under certain circumstances, the larger pool can consistently win. More importantly, an FAW attack, while using intentional forks, does not suffer from practicality issues, unlike selfish mining. We also discuss partial countermeasures against the FAW attack, but finding a cheap and efficient countermeasure remains an open problem. As a result, we expect to see FAW attacks among mining pools.

TI RETHINKING VIRTUAL CURRENCY REGULATION IN THE BITCOIN AGE
SO WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
AB This Article investigates an increasingly important yet under-developed body of law: regulation of virtual currency. At its peak in March of 2014, the daily volume of Bitcoin transactions in United States dollars exceeded $575,000,000. The growing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, however, is best illustrated by the growing number of leading merchants that have decided to accept Bitcoin payments. While Bitcoin's rise as an alternative payment method is well-chronicled, Bitcoin's impact extends further due to its use as an investment vehicle and its ability to spur the growth of an industry of Bitcoin-based businesses. Despite increasingly widespread use, Bitcoin (and other virtual currencies) have largely operated without the burden of regulation. Why? Like the potentially transformative innovations that preceded Bitcoin, virtual currency raises unique challenges for which existing legal models may be unprepared. As policymakers struggle to catch-up, the effort to develop an appropriate regulatory regime for virtual currency is at a critical juncture.
   The response in the United States has thus far involved regulatory bodies acting independently to clarify the treatment of virtual currency under a variety of different laws designed to regulate traditional payment systems, financial services, and investments. This Article argues, contrary to this approach, that a narrow focus on the technical application and extension of existing law creates a deficient regulatory regime. Instead, we suggest that policymakers should: (1) engage the various agency stakeholders to promote cross communication; (2) think more globally about the wide spectrum of issues arising from virtual currency; and (3) embrace the unique and distinct characteristics of virtual currency. In support of this proposition, we show that refocusing on the collection of policy goals advanced by existing law offers policymakers an additional tool to aid in the development of a comprehensive, cohesive, and appropriately-scaled virtual currency regulatory model.

While statistical models using only the properties of the time series itself have been successful in many aspects, we expect to gain a better understanding of the phenomena involved if we can model the underlying system of interacting agents. In this article, we consider the history of Bitcoin, a novel digital currency system, for which the complete list of transactions is available for analysis. Using this dataset, we reconstruct the transaction network between users and analyze changes in the structure of the subgraph induced by the most active users. Our approach is based on the unsupervised identification of important features of the time variation of the network. Applying the widely used method of Principal Component Analysis to the matrix constructed from snapshots of the network at different times, we are able to show how structural changes in the network accompany significant changes in the exchange price of bitcoins.

AB Many cryptocurrencies have come into existence in recent years, with Bitcoin the most prominent among them. Although its short history has been volatile, the virtual currency maintains a core group of committed users. This paper presents an exploratory analysis of Bitcoin users. As a virtual currency and peer-to-peer payment system, Bitcoin may signal future challenges to state oversight and financial powers through its decentralized structure and offer of instantaneous transactions with relative anonymity. Very little is known about the users of Bitcoin, however. Utilizing publicly available survey data of Bitcoin users, this analysis explores the structure of the Bitcoin community in terms of wealth accumulation, optimism about the future of Bitcoin, and themes that attract users to the cryptocurrency. Results indicate that age, time of initial use, geographic location, mining status, engaging online discourse, and political orientation are all relevant factors that help explain various aspects of Bitcoin wealth, optimism, and attraction.

TI Reference values for generic instruments used in routine outcome
   monitoring: the leiden routine outcome monitoring study
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB Introduction: The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Mood & Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire -30 (MASQ-D30), Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36), and Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Short Form (DAPP-SF) are generic instruments that can be used in Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) of patients with common mental disorders. We aimed to generate reference values usually encountered in 'healthy' and 'psychiatrically ill' populations to facilitate correct interpretation of ROM results.
   Methods: We included the following specific reference populations: 1294 subjects from the general population (ROM reference group) recruited through general practitioners, and 5269 psychiatric outpatients diagnosed with mood, anxiety, or somatoform (MAS) disorders (ROM patient group). The outermost 5% of observations were used to define limits for one-sided reference intervals (95th percentiles for BSI, MASQ-D30 and DAPP-SF, and 5th percentiles for SF-36 subscales). Internal consistency and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed.
   Results: Mean age for the ROM reference group was 40.3 years (SD=12.6) and 37.7 years (SD=12.0) for the ROM patient group. The proportion of females was 62.8% and 64.6%, respectively. The mean for cut-off values of healthy individuals was 0.82 for the BSI subscales, 23 for the three MASQ-D30 subscales, 45 for the SF-36 subscales, and 3.1 for the DAPP-SF subscales. Discriminative power of the BSI, MASQ-D30 and SF-36 was good, but it was poor for the DAPP-SF. For all instruments, the internal consistency of the subscales ranged from adequate to excellent.
   Discussion and conclusion: Reference values for the clinical interpretation were provided for the BSI, MASQ-D30, SF-36, and DAPP-SF. Clinical information aided by ROM data may represent the best means to appraise the clinical state of psychiatric outpatients.

TI SELF- AND PARENT REPORT OF ADOLESCENT PERSONALITY PATHOLOGY: INFORMANT
   AGREEMENT AND RELATIONS TO DYSFUNCTION
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS
AB Assessment of personality pathology relies heavily on self-report, although it has been argued that proxy report may contribute valuable information. The present study examined reports of adolescents and parents on dimensions of adolescent personality pathology, as assessed by the DAPP-BQ-A, and their relations to clinician-reported dysfunction in a sample of 110 youngsters referred to mental health services. Adolescent and parent reports showed moderate agreement (mean ICC = .45). However, regression analyses controlling for Axis I psychopathology indicated that both adolescent- and parent-reported dimensions uniquely contributed to variance in dysfunction. Analysis of the multi-trait-multi-informant correlation matrix supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the DAPP-BQ-A. Applying a multi-informant approach in the assessment of adolescent personality pathology using the DAPP-BQ-A may improve decision making on diagnostic and intervention issues.

TI Blockchain for Secure and Efficient Data Sharing in Vehicular Edge
   Computing and Networks
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The drastically increasing volume and the growing trend on the types of data have brought in the possibility of realizing advanced applications such as enhanced driving safety, and have enriched existing vehicular services through data sharing among vehicles and data analysis. Due to limited resources with vehicles, vehicular edge computing and networks (VECONs) i.e., the integration of mobile edge computing and vehicular networks, can provide powerful computing and massive storage resources. However, road side units that primarily presume the role of vehicular edge computing servers cannot be fully trusted, which may lead to serious security and privacy challenges for such integrated platforms despite their promising potential and benefits. We exploit consortium blockchain and smart contract technologies to achieve secure data storage and sharing in vehicular edge networks. These technologies efficiently prevent data sharing without authorization. In addition, we propose a reputation-based data sharing scheme to ensure high-quality data sharing among vehicles. A three-weight subjective logic model is utilized for precisely managing reputation of the vehicles. Numerical results based on a real dataset show that our schemes achieve reasonable efficiency and high-level of security for data sharing in VECONs.

TI Blockchain for AI: Review and Open Research Challenges
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain have become two of the most trending and disruptive technologies. Blockchain technology has the ability to automate payment in cryptocurrency and to provide access to a shared ledger of data, transactions, and logs in a decentralized, secure, and trusted manner. Also with smart contracts, blockchain has the ability to govern interactions among participants with no intermediary or a trusted third party. AI, on the other hand, offers intelligence and decision-making capabilities for machines similar to humans. In this paper, we present a detailed survey on blockchain applications for AI. We review the literature, tabulate, and summarize the emerging blockchain applications, platforms, and protocols specifically targeting AI area. We also identify and discuss open research challenges of utilizing blockchain technologies for AI.

TI Statistical properties and multifractality of Bitcoin
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Using 1-min returns of Bitcoin prices, we investigate statistical properties and multifractality of a Bitcoin time series. We find that the 1-min return distribution is fat tailed, and kurtosis largely deviates from the Gaussian expectation. Although for large sampling periods, kurtosis is anticipated to approach the Gaussian expectation, we find that convergence to that is very slow. Skewness is found to be negative at time scales shorter than one day and becomes consistent with zero at time scales longer than about one week. We also investigate daily volatility-asymmetry by using GARCH, GJR, and RGARCH models, and find no evidence of it. On exploring multifractality using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis, we find that the Bitcoin time series exhibits multifractality. The sources of multifractality are investigated, confirming that both temporal correlation and the fat-tailed distribution contribute to it. The influence of "Brexit" on June 23, 2016 to GBP-USD exchange rate and Bitcoin is examined in multifractal properties. We find that, while Brexit influenced the GBP-USD exchange rate, Bitcoin was robust to Brexit. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain based hybrid network architecture for the smart city
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Recently, the concept of "Smart Cities" has developed considerably with the rise and development of the Internet of Things as new form of sustainable development. Smart cities are based on autonomous and distributed infrastructure that includes intelligent information processing and control systems heterogeneous network infrastructure, and ubiquitous sensing involving millions of information sources Due to the continued growth of data volume and number of connected IoT devices, however, issues such as high latency, bandwidth bottlenecks, security and privacy, and scalability arise in the current smart city network architecture. Designing an efficient, secure, and scalable distributed architecture by bringing computational and storage resources closer to endpoints is needed to address the limitations of today's smart city network. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid network architecture for the smart city by leveraging the strength of emerging Software Defined Networking and blockchain technologies. To achieve efficiency and address the current limitations, our architecture is divided into two parts: core network and edge network. Through the design of a hybrid architecture, our proposed architecture inherits the strength of both centralized and distributed network architectures. We also propose a Proof of-Work scheme in our model to ensure security and privacy. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of our proposed model, we simulate our model and evaluate it based on various performance metrics. The result of the evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Blockchain Based Truthful Incentive Mechanism for Distributed P2P
   Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, peers self-organize and cooperate to effectively complete certain tasks such as forwarding files, delivering messages, or uploading data. Nevertheless, users are selfish in nature and they may refuse to cooperate due to their concerns on energy and bandwidth consumption. Thus each user should receive a satisfying reward to compensate its resource consumption for cooperation. However, suitable incentive mechanisms that can meet the diverse requirements of users in dynamic and distributed P2P environments are still missing. On the other hand, we observe that Blockchain is a decentralized secure digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions and Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies get more and more market capitalization. Therefore in this paper, we propose a Blockchain based truthful incentive mechanism for distributed P2P applications that applies a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin to incentivize users for cooperation. In this mechanism, users who help with a successful delivery get rewarded. As users and miners in the Blockchain P2P system may exhibit selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a secure validation method and a pricing strategy, and integrate them into our incentive mechanism. Through a game theoretical analysis and evaluation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security strength of our proposed incentive mechanism.

TI Blockchain in Logistics and Supply Chain: A Lean Approach for Designing
   Real-World Use Cases
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Blockchain technology can be defined as a distributed ledger database for recording transactions between parties verifiably and permanently. Blockchain emerged as a leading technology layer for financial applications. Nevertheless, in the past years, the attention of researchers and practitioners moved to the application of the Blockchain technologies to other domains. Recently, it represents the backbone of a new digital supply chain. Thanks to its capability of ensuring data immutability and public accessibility of data streams, Blockchain can increase the efficiency, reliability, and transparency of the overall supply chain, and optimize the inbound processes. The literature concerning Blockchain in non-financial applications mainly focused on the technological part and the Business Process Modeling, lacking in terms of standard methodology for designing a strategy to develop and validate the overall Blockchain solution and integrate it in the Business Strategy. Thus, this paper aims to overcome this lack. First, we integrate the current literature filling the lack concerning the digital strategy, creating a standard methodology to design Blockchain technology use cases, which are not related to finance applications. Second, we present the results of a use case in the fresh food delivery, showing the critical aspects of implementing a Blockchain solution. Moreover, the paper discusses how the Blockchain will help in reducing the logistics costs and in optimizing the operations and the research challenges.

TI Can Blockchains Serve an Accounting Purpose?
SO JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN ACCOUNTING
AB The blockchain has enabled the successful creation of decentralized digital currency networks. This success has prompted further investigation into the usefulness of blockchains in other business settings. Because of the blockchain's use as a ledger, the question arises whether the blockchain could become a more secure alternative to current accounting ledgers. We show that this is infeasible. By casting this question in the context of the Byzantine Generals Problem, which the blockchain was designed to solve, we identify multiple flaws hindering implementation of the blockchain as a financial reporting tool. Whereas blockchain-based digital currencies only exist within the blockchain, economic transactions exist outside of accounting records. This distinction prevents an acceptable level of transaction verification using the blockchain model. Additionally, the security benefits of the blockchain that render it ostensibly immutable are not fully available or reliable in an accounting setting.

TI Digital blockchain networks appear to be following Metcalfe's Law
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB An analysis of some of the recent blockchain networks is presented to determine if they satisfy Metcalfe's Law, as has been shown for some online social media networks. The value of the network was modeled based on the price of the digital currency in use on the network, and the number of users by the number of unique addresses each day that engage in transactions on the network. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash networks were analyzed. The analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by Metcalfe's Law, which identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes, or end users. A new network model was also presented that shows the value to be proportional to the exponential of the root of the number of users participating in the network, and shows good agreement as well. Conditions for determining critical mass based on the new model were also presented. Finally, the potential for identifying value bubbles that can be spotted as deviations in value from the model was discussed and illustrated using the data from one of the networks. Those value bubbles show up where repeated extremely high value increases are not accompanied by any commensurate increase in the number of participating users, or any other development that could give rise to the higher value.

TI A Statistical Analysis of Cryptocurrencies
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB We analyze statistical properties of the largest cryptocurrencies (determined by market capitalization), of which Bitcoin is the most prominent example. We characterize their exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar by fitting parametric distributions to them. It is shown that returns are clearly non-normal, however, no single distribution fits well jointly to all the cryptocurrencies analysed. We find that for the most popular currencies, such as Bitcoin and Litecoin, the generalized hyperbolic distribution gives the best fit, while for the smaller cryptocurrencies the normal inverse Gaussian distribution, generalized t distribution, and Laplace distribution give good fits. The results are important for investment and risk management purposes.

TI Intramolecular Energy and Electron Transfer within a
   Diazaperopyrenium-Based Cyclophane
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Molecules capable of performing highly efficient energy transfer and ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer in well-defined multichromophoric structures are indispensable to the development of artificial photofunctional systems. Herein, we report on the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical properties of a rationally designed multichromophoric tetracationic cyclophane, DAPPBox(4+), containing a diazaperopyrenium (DAPP(2+)) unit and an extended viologen (ExBIPY(2+)) unit, which are linked together by two p-xylylene bridges. Both H-1 NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis confirm the formation of an asymmetric, rigid, box-like cyclophane, DAPPBox(4+). The solid-state superstructure of this cyclophane reveals a herringbone-type packing motif; leading to two types of pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions: (i) between the ExBIPY(2+) unit and the DAPP(2+) unit (pi center dot center dot center dot pi distance of 3.7 angstrom) in the adjacent parallel cyclophane, as well as (ii) between the ExBIPY(2+) unit (pi center dot center dot center dot pi distance of 3.2 angstrom) and phenylene ring in the closest orthogonal cyclophane. Moreover, the solution-phase photophysical properties of this cyclophane have been investigated by both steady-state and time-resolved absorption and emission spectroscopies. Upon photoexcitation of DAPPBox(4+) at 330 nm, rapid and quantitative intramolecular energy transfer occurs from the (1)*ExBIPY(2+) unit to the DAPP(2+) unit in 0.5 ps to yield (1)*DAPP(2+). The same excitation wavelength simultaneously populates a higher excited state of 1*DAPP(2+) which then undergoes ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer from 1*DAPP(2+) to ExBIPY(2+) to yield the DAPP(3+center dot)-ExBIPY(+center dot) radical ion pair in tau = 1.5 ps. Selective excitation of DAPP(2+) at 505 nm populates a lower excited state where electron transfer is kinetically unfavorable.

AB Recent quality scandals reveal the importance of quality management from a supply chain perspective. Although there has been many related studies focusing on supply chain quality management, the technologies used still have difficulties in resolving problems arising from the lack of trust in supply chains. The root reason lies in three challenges brought to the traditional centralized trust mechanism: self-interests of supply chain members, information asymmetry in production processes, costs and limitations of quality inspections. Blockchain is a promising technology to address these problems. In this paper, we discuss how to improve the supply chain quality management by adopting the blockchain technology, and propose a framework for blockchain-based supply chain quality management.

AB Despite a great deal of work to improve the TLS PKI, CA misbehavior continues to occur, resulting in unauthorized certificates that can be used to mount man-in-themiddle attacks against HTTPS sites. CAs lack the incentives to invest in higher security, and the manual effort required to report a rogue certificate deters many from contributing to the security of the TLS PKI. In this paper, we present IKP, a platform that automates responses to unauthorized certificates and provides incentives for CAs to behave correctly and for others to report potentially unauthorized certificates. Domains in IKP specify criteria for their certificates, and CAs specify reactions such as financial penalties that execute in case of unauthorized certificate issuance. By leveraging smart contracts and blockchain-based consensus, we can decentralize IKP while still providing automated incentives. We describe a theoretical model for payment flows and implement IKP in Ethereum to show that decentralizing and automating PKIs with financial incentives is both economically sound and technically viable.

TI A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments among Men with No Names
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB Bitcoin is a purely online virtual currency, unbacked by either physical commodities or sovereign obligation; instead, it relies on a combination of cryptographic protection and a peer-to-peer protocol for witnessing settlements. Consequently, Bitcoin has the unintuitive property that while the ownership of money is implicitly anonymous, its flow is globally visible. In this paper we explore this unique characteristic further, using heuristic clustering to group Bitcoin wallets based on evidence of shared authority, and then using re-identification attacks (i. e., empirical purchasing of goods and services) to classify the operators of those clusters. From this analysis, we consider the challenges for those seeking to use Bitcoin for criminal or fraudulent purposes at scale.

AB Blockchain technology has emerged as a solution to consistency problems in peer to peer networks. By now, it has matured as a solution to a range of use cases in which it can effectively provide the notion of third party trust without the need for a trusted (physical) third party, which makes it an attractive coordination mechanism for distributed systems. To promote the wide adoption of this technology, we yet lack mechanisms that make the specification and interpretation of smart contracts accessible to a broader audience. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that supports the semi-automated translation of human-readable contract representations into computational equivalents in order to enable the codification of laws into verifiable and enforceable computational structures that reside within a public blockchain. We identify smart contract components that correspond to real world institutions, and propose a mapping that we operationalize using a domain-specific language in order to support the contract modeling process. We explore this capability based on selected examples and plot out directions for future research on smart contracts.

TI Blockchains and the Boundaries of Self-Organized Economies: Predictions
   for the Future of Banking
SO BANKING BEYOND BANKS AND MONEY: A GUIDE TO BANKING SERVICES IN THE
   TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
SE New Economic Windows
AB This chapter uses economic theory to explore the implications of blockchain technology on the future of banking. We apply an economic analysis of blockchains based on both new institutional economics and public choice economics. Our main focus is on the economics of why banks exist as organizations (rather than a world in which all financial transactions occurring in markets), and how banks are then impacted by technological change that affects transaction costs. Our core argument is that blockchains are more than just a new technology to be applied by banks, but rather compete with banks as organizations, enabling banking transactions to shift out of centralized hierarchical organizations and back into decentralized markets. Blockchains are a new institutional technology-because of how they affect transaction costs in financial markets-that will fundamentally re-order the governance of the production of banking services. We then explore this implication through broader political economy lens in which banking moves out of organizations and deeper into markets. We examine this as a form of institutional economic evolution in which the boundary of catallaxy-i.e., a self-organized economy-is enlarged, at the margin of the banking sector. Such institutional competition enables evolutionary discovery in the institutions of banking.

CL Chicago, IL
AB Individuals and businesses make numerous payments every day. They sometimes have choices about what forms of payment to make or accept, and at other times are effectively forced to use a particular form. Often there is an asymmetric power relationship between payer and payee that raises the issue of whether one side unfairly exploits the other. Is it unethical exploitation for an employer to pay employees with a fee-laden payroll card over other more convenient forms of payment? Does the fee structure of payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard unfairly exploit merchants? The bitcoin payment system is an ethical as well as technological evolution as it was designed to be an electronic payment system that does not rely upon trust. Can an entire payment system like bitcoin be "evil," as charged by Krugman (2013)? Payment tools as such are ethically neutral, but can be used in an ethical or unethical manner.

TI IS BITCOIN BUSINESS INCOME OR SPECULATIVE FOOLERY? NEW IDEAS THROUGH AN
   IMPROVED FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS
SO ANNALS OF FINANCIAL ECONOMICS
AB The present study addresses one of the most problematic phenomena: Bitcoin price. We explore the Granger causality for two relationships (Bitcoin price and trade transactions; Bitcoin price and investors' attractiveness) from a frequency domain perspective-based on unconditional and conditional data analysis. Accurately, this research empirically assesses the causal links between these variables unconditionally on the one hand and conditioning upon relevant control variables (recorded in literature) on the other hand. The observed outcomes reveal some differences with respect to the frequencies involved, highlighting the difficulty to reach clearer insights and better paths into this nascent crypto-currency. Beyond the nuances of short-, medium- and long-run frequencies, this paper confirms the extremely speculative nature of Bitcoin without overlooking its usefulness in economic reasons. The consideration of the Chinese market index, the hash rate, the monetary velocity and the estimated output volume has led to solid and meaningful findings connecting further Bitcoin to speculation.

SO RSC ADVANCES
AB Four chrysin modified mPEG-PCL block copolymers with different chain lengths of mPEG and PCL blocks were synthesized and self-assembled into micelles to load the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The effect of block chain length on drug delivery was investigated. The four block copolymers were characterized by H-1 NMR, GPC and DSC. The drug loading contents of all the micelles were higher than 20%, the mPEG2k-PCL5k-CHS micelles showed the highest drug loading content and encapsulation efficiency of 26.8% and 93%, respectively. The micelles were spherical with the size increasing after drug encapsulation, and the mean size of the drug loaded micelles was around 100 nanometers. pi-pi stacking interactions between the micelles and DOX was invoked. The mPEG2k-PCL5k-CHS micelles exhibited the best profile for sustained-release. The cellular uptake and IC50 revealed that the DOX loaded mPEG2k-PCL5k-CHS micelles showed the best anticancer activity in vitro.

AB An implicit goal of Bitcoin's reward structure is to diffuse network influence over a diverse, decentralized population of individual participants. Indeed, Bitcoin's security claims rely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently large portion of the network's overall computational power. Unfortunately, rather than participating independently, most Bitcoin miners join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largely directs the pool's activity, leading to a consolidation of power. Recently, the largest mining pool has accounted for more than half of network's total mining capacity. Relatedly, "hosted mining" service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale, tempting them away from independent participation. We argue that the prevalence of mining coalitions is due to a limitation of the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle specifically, that it affords an effective mechanism for enforcing cooperation in a coalition. We present several definitions and constructions for "nonoutsourceable" puzzles that thwart such enforcement mechanisms, thereby deterring coalitions. We also provide an implementation and benchmark results for our schemes to show they are practical.

AB Cashless payments are nowadays ubiquitous and decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin are increasingly used as means of payment. However, due to the delay of the transaction confirmation in Bitcoin, it is not used for payments that rely on quick transaction confirmation. We present a concept that addresses this drawback of Bitcoin and allows it to be used for fast transactions. We evaluate the performance of the concept using double-spending attacks and show that, employing our concept, the success of such attacks diminishes to less than 0.09%. Moreover, we present a real world application: We modified a snack vending machine to accept Bitcoin payments and make use of fast transaction confirmations.

TI Does unstable mood increase risk of suicide? Theory, research and
   practice
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: Suicide represents a substantial problem, with significant societal and personal impact. The identification of factors influencing suicide risk is an important step in preventing self-harming behaviour. In this article the authors explore whether emotional instability increases risk of suicide, beyond that of mood intensity.
   Method: This article provides a summary of existing theory and indirect evidence in support of an association between emotional instability and suicidality. A systematic literature search (Embase, Medline, PsychInfo) was carried out on literature conducted up to October, 2011. Meta-analysis was used to assess the strength of the proposed association.
   Results: The systematic search identified 20 journal articles meeting the inclusion criteria, including retrospective questionnaire design studies and research conducted across several time-points. Meta-analysis revealed a moderate association, which remained statistically significant even when only including studies conducted over multiple time-points. This effect was attenuated, but remained significant, when controlling for study selection bias.
   Limitations: Retrospective questionnaire studies failed to adequately control for mood level. Little is still currently understood about the types of emotional instability (e.g., dysoria, anxiety) most associated with suicidality.
   Conclusions: Future avenues of investigation include micro- to macro-longitudinal research and the differentiation of emotion subtypes and instability metrics. Momentary assessment techniques may help to detect subtle fluctuations in mood leading to more effective and immediate intervention. Psychosocial intervention strategies for treating unstable emotions are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A framework for secure and decentralized sharing of medical imaging data
   via blockchain consensus
SO HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB The electronic sharing of medical imaging data is an important element of modern healthcare systems, but current infrastructure for cross-site image transfer depends on trust in third-party intermediaries. In this work, we examine the blockchain concept, which enables parties to establish consensus without relying on a central authority. We develop a framework for cross-domain image sharing that uses a blockchain as a distributed data store to establish a ledger of radiological studies and patient-defined access permissions. The blockchain framework is shown to eliminate third-party access to protected health information, satisfy many criteria of an interoperable health system, and readily generalize to domains beyond medical imaging. Relative drawbacks of the framework include the complexity of the privacy and security models and an unclear regulatory environment. Ultimately, the large-scale feasibility of such an approach remains to be demonstrated and will depend on a number of factors which we discuss in detail.

AB New emerging manufacturing paradigms such as cloud manufacturing, IoT enabled manufacturing and service oriented manufacturing, have brought many advantages to the manufacturing industry and metamorphosis the industrial IT infrastructure. However, all existing paradigms still suffer from the main problem related to centralized industrial network and third part trust operation. In a nutshell, centralized networking has had issues with flexibility, efficiency, availability, and security. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to present a distributed peer to peer network architecture that improves the security and scalability of the CMfg. The proposed architecture was developed based on blockchain technology, this facilitated the development of a distributed peer to peer network with high security, scalability and a well-structured cloud system. The proposed architecture which was named as the "BCmfg" is made up of five layers namely; resource layer, perception layer, manufacturing layer, infrastructure layer and application layer. In this paper, the concept of its architecture, secure data sharing, and typical characteristic are discussed and investigated as well as the key technologies required for the implementation of this proposed architecture is explained based on demonstrative case study. The proposed architecture is explained based on a case study which contains five service providers and 15 end users with considering 32 OnCloud services. For evaluation purpose, the qualitative and quantitative methods are utilized and the results show that the proposed methodology can bring more advantages to CMfg than the security and scalability.

We investigate whether the introduction of futures trading in Bitcoin is able to resolve the issues that stopped Bitcoin from being considered a currency. Our analysis shows that spot volatility has increased following the appearance of futures contracts, that futures contracts are not an effective hedging instrument, and that price discovery is driven by uninformed investors in the spot market. We therefore argue that the conclusion that Bitcoin is a speculative asset rather than a currency is not altered by the introduction of futures trading. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO RESOURCES POLICY
AB Unlike prior studies, this study examines the nonlinear, asymmetric and quantile effects of aggregate commodity index and gold prices on the price of Bitcoin. Using daily data from July 17, 2010 to February 2, 2017, we employed several advanced autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) models. The nonlinear ARDL approach was applied to uncover short- and long-run asymmetries, whereas the quantile ARDL was applied to account for a second type of asymmetry, known as the distributional asymmetry according to the position of a dependent variable within its own distribution. Moreover, we extended the nonlinear ARDL to a quantile framework, leading to a richer new model, which allows testing for distributional asymmetry while accounting for short- and long-run asymmetries. Overall, our results indicate the possibility to predict Bitcoin price movements based on price information from the aggregate commodity index and gold prices. Importantly, we report the nuanced result that most often the relations between bitcoin and aggregate commodity, on the one hand, and between bitcoin and gold, on the other, are asymmetric, nonlinear, and quantiles-dependent, suggesting the need to apply non-standard cointegration models to uncover the complexity and hidden relations between Bitcoin and asset classes.

TI Blockchain tokens and the potential democratization of entrepreneurship
   and innovation
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB Over the past few years, Bitcoin has emerged as the first decentralized, global currency. The rise of Bitcoin has brought attention not only to digital currencies but also to the underlying technology empowering digital currencies: blockchain technology. A blockchain is a distributed ledger that records and secures transactions in a peer-to-peer network. Besides empowering digital currencies, blockchain technology has given innovators the capability of creating digital tokens to represent scarce assets, potentially reshaping the landscape of entrepreneurship and innovation. Blockchain tokens may democratize (1) entrepreneurship by giving entrepreneurs new ways to raise funds and engage stakeholders, and (2) innovation by giving innovators a new way to develop, deploy, and diffuse decentralized applications. Blockchain technology and tokens have sparked a new wave of innovation, which may start to revolutionize entrepreneurship and innovation. (C) 2018 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

TI FlopCoin: A Cryptocurrency for Computation Offloading
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING
AB During the last years, researche'rs have proposed solutions to help smartphones improve execution time and reduce energy consumption by offloading heavy tasks to remote entities. Lately, inspired by the promising results of message forwarding in opportunistic networks, many researchers have proposed strategies for task offloading towards nearby mobile devices, giving birth to the Device-to-Device offloading paradigm. None of these strategies, though, offers any mechanism that considers selfish users and, most importantly, that motivates and defrays the participating devices who spend their resources. In this paper, we address these problems and propose the design of a framework that integrates an incentive scheme and a reputation mechanism. Our proposal follows the principles of the Hidden Market Design approach, which allows users to specify the amount of resources they are willing to sacrifice when participating in the offloading system. The underlying algorithm, that users are not aware of, is based on a truthful auction strategy and a peer-to-peer reputation exchange scheme. Extensive simulations on real traces depict how our designed mechanism achieves higher offloading rate and produces less traffic compared to three benchmark algorithms. Finally, we show how collaborating devices get rewarded for their contribution, while selfish ones get sidelined by others.

TI Blockchain-based publicly verifiable data deletion scheme for cloud
   storage
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB With the rapid development of cloud storage, more and more data owners store their data on the remote cloud, that can reduce data owners' overhead because the cloud server maintaining the data for them, e.g., storing, updating and deletion. However, that leads to data deletion becomes a security challenge because the cloud server may not delete the data honestly for financial incentives. Recently, plenty of research works have been done on secure data deletion. However, most of the existing methods can be summarized with the same protocol essentially, which called "one-bit-return" protocol: the storage server deletes the data and returns a one-bit result. The data owner has to believe the returned result because he cannot verify it. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based data deletion scheme, which can make the deletion operation more transparent. In our scheme, the data owner can verify the deletion result no matter how malevolently the cloud server behaves. Besides, with the application of blockchain, the proposed scheme can achieve public verification without any trusted third party.

AB Smart Contracts have gained tremendous popularity in the past few years, to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every day through such technology. However, since the release of the Frontier network of Ethereum in 2015, there have been many cases in which the execution of Smart Contracts managing Ether coins has led to problems or conflicts. Compared to traditional Software Engineering, a discipline of Smart Contract and Blockchain programming, with standardized best practices that can help solve the mentioned problems and conflicts, is not yet sufficiently developed. Furthermore, Smart Contracts rely on a non-standard software life-cycle, according to which, for instance, delivered applications can hardly be updated or bugs resolved by releasing a new version of the software.
   In this paper we advocate the need for a discipline of Blockchain Software Engineering, addressing the issues posed by smart contract programming and other applications running on blockchains. We analyse a case of study where a bug discovered in a Smart Contract library, and perhaps "unsafe" programming, allowed an attack on Parity, a wallet application, causing the freezing of about 500K Ethers (about 150M USD, in November 2017). In this study we analyze the source code of Parity and the library, and discuss how recognised best practices could mitigate, if adopted and adapted, such detrimental software misbehavior. We also reflect on the specificity of Smart Contract software development, which makes some of the existing approaches insufficient, and call for the definition of a specific Blockchain Software Engineering.

TI A Privacy-Preserving Trust Model Based on Blockchain for VANETs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The public key infrastructure-based authentication protocol provides basic security services for the vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). However, trust and privacy are still open issues due to the unique characteristics of VANETs. It is crucial to prevent internal vehicles from broadcasting forged messages while simultaneously preserving the privacy of vehicles against the tracking attacks. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based anonymous reputation system (BARS) to establish a privacy-preserving trust model for VANETs. The certificate and revocation transparency is implemented efficiently with the proofs of presence and absence based on the extended blockchain technology. The public keys are used as pseudonyms in communications without any information about real identities for conditional anonymity. In order to prevent the distribution of forged messages, a reputation evaluation algorithm is presented relying on both direct historical interactions and indirect opinions about vehicles. A set of experiments is conducted to evaluate BARS in terms of security, validity, and performance, and the results show that BARS is able to establish a trust model with transparency, conditional anonymity, efficiency, and robustness for VANETs.

AB Smart contracts that build up on blockchain technologies are receiving great attention in new business applications and the scientific community, because they allow untrusted parties to manifest contract terms in program code and thus eliminate the need for a trusted third party. The creation process of writing well performing and secure contracts in Ethereum, which is today's most prominent smart contract platform, is a difficult task. Research on this topic has only recently started in industry and science. Based on an analysis of collected data with Grounded Theory techniques, we have elaborated several common security patterns, which we describe in detail on the basis of Solidity, the dominating programming language for Ethereum. The presented patterns describe solutions to typical security issues and can be applied by Solidity developers to mitigate typical attack scenarios.

In particular, the empirical results show that (1) there exists heavy tails for all the returns of cryptocurrencies; (2) the autocorrelations for returns decay quickly, while the autocorrelations for absolute returns decay slowly; (3) returns of cryptocurrencies display strong volatility clustering and leverage effects; (4) Hurst exponent for volatility is more volatile than that of the returns, while they all suggest the long-range dependence phenomena; and (5) there exists power-law correlation between price and volume.

TI On the return-volatility relationship in the Bitcoin market around the
   price crash of 2013
SO ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL
AB The authors examine the relation between price returns and volatility changes in the Bitcoin market using a daily database denominated in US dollar. The results for the entire period provide no evidence of an asymmetric return-volatility relation in the Bitcoin market. The authors test if there is a difference in the return-volatility relation before and after the price crash of 2013 and show a significant inverse relation between past shocks and volatility before the crash and no significant relation after. This finding shows that, prior to the price crash of December 2013, positive shocks increased the conditional volatility more than negative shocks. This inverted asymmetric reaction of Bitcoin to positive and negative shocks is contrary to what one observes in equities. As leverage effect and volatility feedback do not adequately explain this reaction, the authors propose the safe-haven effect (Baur, Asymmetric volatility in the gold market, 2012). They highlight the benefits of adding Bitcoin to a US equity portfolio, especially in the pre-crash period. Robustness analyses show, among others, a negative relation between the US implied volatility index (VIX) and Bitcoin volatility. Those additional analyses further support the findings and provide useful information for economic actors who are interested in adding Bitcoin to their equity portfolios or are curious about the capabilities of Bitcoin as a financial asset.

AB We put forward a new framework that makes it possible to re-write or compress the content of any number of blocks in decentralized services exploiting the blockchain technology. As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove inappropriate content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to "the right to be forgotten."
   Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS '00), which allow determining hash collisions efficiently, given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case with Bitcoin).
   We also report on a proof-of-concept implementation of a redactable blockchain, building on top of Nakamoto's Bitcoin core. The prototype only requires minimal changes to the way current client software interprets the information stored in the blockchain and to the current blockchain, block, or transaction structures. Moreover, our experiments show that the overhead imposed by a redactable blockchain is small compared to the case of an immutable one.

This model poses a number of issues including data availability, high operational cost, and data security. In this paper, we introduce a system that leverages blockchain technology to provide a secure distributed data storage with keyword search service. The system allows the client to upload their data in encrypted form, distributes the data content to cloud nodes and ensures data availability using cryptographic techniques. It also provides the data owner a capability to grant permission for others to search on her data. Finally, the system supports private keyword search over the encrypted dataset.

However, not Bitcoin but the underlying technology blockchain offers the possibility to innovatively change industries. The decentralized structure of the blockchain is particularly suitable for implementing control and business processes in microgrids, using smart contracts and decentralized applications. This paper provides a state of the art survey overview of current blockchain technology based projects with the potential to revolutionize microgrids and provides a first attempt to technically characterize different start-up approaches. The most promising use case from the microgrid perspective is peer-to-peer trading, where energy is exchanged and traded locally between consumers and prosumers. An application concept for distributed PV generation is provided in this promising area.

AB Supply Chain Management systems provide information sharing and analysis to companies and support their planning activities. They are not based on the real data because there is asymmetric information between companies, then leading to disturbance of the planning algorithms. On the other hand, sharing data between manufacturers, suppliers and customers becomes very important to ensure reactivity towards markets variability. Especially, double marginalization is a widespread and serious problem in supply chain management. Decentralized systems under wholesale price contracts are investigated, with double marginalization effects shown to lead to supply insufficiencies, in the cases of both deterministic and random demands. This paper proposes a blockchain based solution to address the problems of supply chain such as Double Marginalization and Information Asymmetry etc.

AB Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting-anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents "sybil attacks" (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. "moderately hard functions") introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto' 92). Recent work by Garay et al (EuroCrypt' 15) and Pass et al (manuscript, 2016) demonstrate that this protocol provably achieves consistency and liveness assuming a) honest players control a majority of the computational power in the network, b) the puzzle-hardness is appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay and the total computational power of the network, and c) the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. Assuming honest participation, however, is a strong assumption, especially in a setting where honest players are expected to perform a lot of work (to solve the computational puzzles). In Nakamoto's Bitcoin application of the blockchain protocol, players are incentivized to solve these puzzles by receiving rewards for every "block" (of transactions) they contribute to the blockchain. An elegant work by Eyal and Sirer (FinancialCrypt' 14), strengthening and formalizing an earlier attack discussed on the Bitcoin forum, demonstrates that a coalition controlling even a minority fraction of the computational power in the network can gain (close to) 2 times its "fair share" of the rewards (and transaction fees) by deviating from the protocol instructions. In contrast, in a fair protocol, one would expect that players controlling a phi fraction of the computational resources to reap a phi fraction of the rewards.
   We present a newblockchain protocol-the FruitChain protocol-which satisfies the same consistency and liveness properties as Nakamoto's protocol (assuming an honest majority of the computing power), and additionally is delta-approximately fair: with overwhelming probability, any honest set of players controlling a. fraction of computational power is guaranteed to get at least a fraction (1 - delta)phi of the blocks (and thus rewards) in any Omega(kappa/delta) length segment of the chain (where. is the security parameter). Consequently, if this blockchain protocol is used as the ledger underlying a cryptocurrency system, where rewards and transaction fees are evenly distributed among the miners of blocks in a length. segment of the chain, no coalition controlling less than a majority of the computing power can gain more than a factor (1 + 3 delta) by deviating from the protocol (i.e., honest participation is an n/2-coalition-safe 3 delta-Nash equilibrium). Finally, the FruitChain protocol enables decreasing the variance of mining rewards and as such significantly lessens (or even obliterates) the need for mining pools.

Hitherto, it is used for the decentralization of markets more generally, not exclusively for the decentralization of money and payments. The decentralized transaction ledger of blockchain could be employed to register, confirm, and send all kinds of contracts to other parties in the network. In this paper, we thoroughly review state-of-the-art blockchain-related applications emerged in the literature. A number of published works were carefully included based on their contributions to the blockchain's body of knowledge. Several remarks are explored and discussed in the last section of the paper.

AB With the increasingly serious problem of food safety in China, it directly or indirectly endangers people's health, quality of life and safety of life. The global economy, politics and society as a whole have a greater impact. As an effective means of product quality and safety management and control, many countries and regions have been researched, developed and operated of the traceability system. On the one hand, these technologies have not been able to achieve more accurate traceability, these results cannot be directly used in Chinese market. Therefore, the article introduces the concept of Blockchain technology, putting forward the application of Blockchain technology in information security of the food supply chain and comparing it with the traditional supply chain system.

TI Are blockchains immune to all malicious attacks?
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Background: In recent years, blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention. It records cryptographic transactions in a public ledger that is difficult to alter and compromise because of the distributed consensus. As a result, blockchain is believed to resist fraud and hacking.
   Results: This work explores the types of fraud and malicious activities that can be prevented by blockchain technology and identifies attacks to which blockchain remains vulnerable.
   Conclusions: This study recommends appropriate defensive measures and calls for further research into the techniques for fighting malicious activities related to blockchains.

TI The digital agenda of virtual currencies: Can BitCoin become a global
   currency?
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB This paper identifies and analyzes BitCoin features which may facilitate BitCoin to become a global currency, as well as characteristics which may impede the use of BitCoin as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value, and compares BitCoin with standard currencies with respect to the main functions of money. Among all analyzed BitCoin features, the extreme price volatility stands out most clearly compared to standard currencies. In order to understand the reasons for such extreme price volatility, we attempt to identify drivers of BitCoin price formation and estimate their importance econometrically. We apply time-series analytical mechanisms to daily data for the 2009-2014 period. Our estimation results suggest that BitCoin attractiveness indicators are the strongest drivers of BitCoin price followed by market forces. In contrast, macro-financial developments do not determine BitCoin price in the long-run. Our findings suggest that as long as BitCoin price will be mainly driven by speculative investments, BitCoin will not be able to compete with standard currencies.

TI Correlation of Standard Diffusion-Weighted Imaging and Diffusion
   Kurtosis Imaging With Distant Metastases of Rectal Carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB Purpose: To investigate the correlation of standard diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) with distant metastases of rectal carcinoma.
   Materials and Methods: Fifty-eight patients with rectal carcinoma (27 with distant metastasis and 31 with no metastasis) were included in this study. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value from standard DWI (b values of 0 and 1000 sec/mm(2)), D-app, and K-app from DKI (b values of 0, 700, 1400, and 2000 sec/mm(2)) were acquired with a 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. These quantitative parameters were calculated from the entire tumors. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to assess the utility for discrimination of tumor with distant metastasis and those without metastasis. Parameters were compared using the independent-samples t-test.
   Results: The histogram metrics 10th percentile of D-app (Dapp-10th) and ADC values (ADC(10th)) were significantly lower in the distant metastasis group than those without metastasis (972.5 +/- 118.8 vs. 1121.3 +/- 133.8x10(-6) mm(2)/s, P=0.03; 809.2 +/- 67.1 vs. 856.2 +/- 72.1x10(-6) mm(2)/s, P=0.03). Dapp-10th showed relatively higher area under the curve (AUC) (0.856 vs. 0.669, P=0.024), and higher specificity (100% vs. 68%) than ADC(10th) did for differentiation of lesions with distant metastasis from those without metastasis.
   Conclusion: DKI was relatively better than standard DWI in discriminating rectal carcinoma with distant metastasis from those without metastasis.

TI Visualizing Dynamic Bitcoin Transaction Patterns
SO BIG DATA
AB This work presents a systemic top-down visualization of Bitcoin transaction activity to explore dynamically generated patterns of algorithmic behavior. Bitcoin dominates the cryptocurrency markets and presents researchers with a rich source of real-time transactional data. The pseudonymous yet public nature of the data presents opportunities for the discovery of human and algorithmic behavioral patterns of interest to many parties such as financial regulators, protocol designers, and security analysts. However, retaining visual fidelity to the underlying data to retain a fuller understanding of activity within the network remains challenging, particularly in real time. We expose an effective force-directed graph visualization employed in our large-scale data observation facility to accelerate this data exploration and derive useful insight among domain experts and the general public alike. The high-fidelity visualizations demonstrated in this article allowed for collaborative discovery of unexpected high frequency transaction patterns, including automated laundering operations, and the evolution of multiple distinct algorithmic denial of service attacks on the Bitcoin network.

TI Bitcoin as a Complement to Emerging Market Currencies
SO EMERGING MARKETS FINANCE AND TRADE
AB Bitcoin is a digital currency that has gained significant traction as an economic instrument. Despite its rise, it has received little attention from the scholarly community. This study is one of the first studies to examine Bitcoin's use as a complement to emerging markets currencies; more specifically, I analyze the value and volatility of Bitcoin relative to emerging market currencies and explore ways in which Bitcoin can complement emerging market currencies. The results suggest that Bitcoin has characteristics that make it well-suited to work as a complement to emerging market currencies and that there are ways to minimize Bitcoin's risks.

AB Bitcoin has emerged as the most successful cryptocurrency since its appearance back in 2009. However, its main drawback to become a truly global payment system is its low capacity in transaction throughput. At present time, some ideas have been proposed to increase the transaction throughput, with different impact on the scalability of the system. Some of these ideas propose to decouple standard transactions from the blockchain core and to manage them through a parallel payment network, relegating the usage of the bitcoin blockchain only to transactions which consolidate multiple of those off-chain movements. Such mechanisms generate new actors in the bitcoin payment scenario, the Payment Service Providers, and new privacy issues arise regarding bitcoin users. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive description of the most relevant scalability solutions proposed for the bitcoin network and we outline its impact on users' privacy based on the early stage proposals published so far.

AB GPU and FPGA-based clouds have already demonstrated the promise of accelerating computing-intensive workloads with greatly improved power and performance.
   In this paper, we examine the design of ASIC Clouds, which are purpose-built datacenters comprised of large arrays of ASIC accelerators, whose purpose is to optimize the total cost of ownership (TCO) of large, high-volume chronic computations, which are becoming increasingly common as more and more services are built around the Cloud model. On the surface, the creation of ASIC clouds may seem highly improbable due to high NREs and the inflexibility of ASICs. Surprisingly, however, large-scale ASIC Clouds have already been deployed by a large number of commercial entities, to implement the distributed Bitcoin cryptocurrency system.
   We begin with a case study of Bitcoin mining ASIC Clouds, which are perhaps the largest ASIC Clouds to date. From there, we design three more ASIC Clouds, including a YouTube-style video transcoding ASIC Cloud, a Litecoin ASIC Cloud, and a Convolutional Neural Network ASIC Cloud and show 2-3 orders of magnitude better TCO versus CPU and GPU.
   Among our contributions, we present a methodology that given an accelerator design, derives Pareto-optimal ASIC Cloud Servers, by extracting data from place-and-routed circuits and computational fluid dynamic simulations, and then employing clever but brute-force search to find the best jointly-optimized ASIC, DRAM subsystem, motherboard, power delivery system, cooling system, operating voltage, and case design. Moreover, we show how data center parameters determine which of the many Pareto-optimal points is TCO-optimal. Finally we examine when it makes sense to build an ASIC Cloud, and examine the impact of ASIC NRE.

AB Blockchain (BC) has received significant attention recently. This paper presents system-related issues for BCs for financial applications. This paper first presents the design of a BC without consideration of any application scenarios, and issues such as performance, security, performance and scalability lead to specific BC designs. Sample BC scenarios are analyzed and these lead to additional BC designs. Specifically, two new kinds of BC emerge: for storing information at transactional level, for storing account information. By splitting traditional BCs into these two BCs allow one to optimize the system with respect to scalability and privacy.

AB Differentiating autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) without accompanying intellectual impairment from personality disorders is often challenging. Identifying personality traits and personality pathology specific to ASD might facilitate diagnostic procedure. We recruited a sample of 59 adults with ASD without accompanying intellectual impairment, 62 individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, 80 individuals with borderline personality disorder, and 106 nonclinical controls. Personality traits, measured with the neo-personality inventory-revised (NEO-PI-R), and personality pathology, measured with the dimensional assessment of personality pathology (DAPP-BQ), were assessed. Personality traits and personality pathology specific to ASD could be identified. ASD individuals scored significantly lower on the NEO-PI-R scales extraversion and openness to experience and significantly higher on the DAPP-BQ scales inhibitedness and compulsivity relative to all other groups. Diagnostic implications are discussed.

SO POLYMER
AB Mixtures of furan (F)-terminated AB diblock copolymer of F-PEG-PLA and ABA triblock copolymer of PLA-PEG-PLA (PEG: poly(oxyethylene), PEA: poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) or poly(D-lactide) (PDLA) depending on the enantiomeric block chain) having different compositions were readily synthesized by ROP of L- and D-lactides using partially furanylated PEGs as the macro initiators. Mixed micelle solutions of the enantiomeric copolymer mixtures (F-PEG-PDLA/PDLA-PEG-PDLA + F-PEG-PLLA/PLLA-PEG-PLLA) were prepared in the presence and absence of a coupling agent 1,8-bis(maleimido)diethylene glycol (BMG). Both the BMG-free and BMG-added mixed micelle solutions underwent sol gel transition, and in which the gel strength was found to become much higher in the BMG-added micelle solutions, reaching a level of 11 kPa. These hydrogel systems were thought to be controlled by the dual cross-linking mechanisms for the gel formation: stereocomplex formation between the enantiomeric PLA blocks and Diels-Alder coupling of the furanyl terminals on PEG blocks with BMG. These sol gel systems producing strengthened gels are versatile for use as injectable scaffolds in the tissue engineering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Bitcoin-Based Decentralized Carbon Emissions Trading Infrastructure
   Model
SO SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB This paper presents a system-of-systems architecture model for a Decentralized Carbon Emissions Trading Infrastructure (D-CETI) with focus on privacy and system security goals. The structure and behavior are implemented as a solution to the problem of trading carbon emissions anonymously among the trading agents. Privacy and security of the trading agents and their carbon credits are the main requirements behind the architecture of D-CETI. The decentralized structure of multiple systems and distributed behavior are the two main features of D-CETI that distinguish it from the traditional carbon trading schemes and protocols. D-CETI is based on Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer digital currency with no central authority, and Open Transactions, a system that simplifies the use of cryptography in financial transactions. The architecture of D-CETI is evaluated and compared with the architecture of five other carbon emissions trading platforms. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We show that equivocation, i.e., making conflicting statements to others in a distributed protocol, can be monetarily disincentivized by the use of crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin. To this end, we design completely decentralized non-equivocation contracts, which make it possible to penalize an equivocating party by the loss of its money. At the core of these contracts, there is a novel cryptographic primitive called accountable assertions, which reveals the party's Bitcoin credentials if it equivocates.
   Non-equivocation contracts are particularly useful for distributed systems that employ public append-only logs to protect data integrity, e.g., in cloud storage and social networks. Moreover, as double-spending in Bitcoin is a special case of equivocation, the contracts enable us to design a payment protocol that allows a payee to receive funds at several unsynchronized points of sale, while being able to penalize a double-spending payer after the fact.

TI Economic evaluation of common reed potential for energy production: A
   case study in Wuliangsuhai Lake (Inner Mongolia, China)
SO BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
AB Wuliangsuhai Lake is one of the largest wetlands in Inner Mongolia, China, half covered by large and highly productive Common Reed (Phragmites australis) stands. However, benefits from current utilization practices do not cover the costs of harvesting. Against this background, Wuliangsuhai Lake is taken as a case study for the assessment of the potential use of reed biomass for energy production. Taking into account, both the present and the potential reed availability, four scenarios are considered, i. e. (1) a decentralized application in household stoves, (2) a centralized reed supplied combined heat and power gasification, (3) a direct combustion plant and (4) a co-firing in existing coal plants. Two field campaigns have been conducted firstly collect information about the current situation of the reed and coal market and secondly to measure reed above-ground biomass. The suitability of reed for thermochemical conversion processes has been evaluated by means of chemicalphysical, calorimetric, and thermal analyses of the samples. The potential energy production is valued regarding the profitability on the current Chinese energy market. Possible subsidies for reed as a renewable resource are taken into account. The evaluation has shown that reed has the potential to act as an energy feedstock. In relation to the considered study site, reed energy use can be profitable on the household level, in CHP combustion plants and in co-combustion. Gasification CHP plants are not economic feasible under current conditions. The results show that reed can be a sustainable alternative to highly health and environment damaging coal.

This requires every recipient of Bitcoin payments not only to check all incoming transactions for possible blacklistings, but also to assess the risk of a transaction being blacklisted in the future. We elaborate this scenario, specify a risk model, devise a prediction approach using public knowledge, and present preliminary results using data from selected known thefts. We discuss the implications on markets where bitcoins are traded and critically revisit Bitcoin's ability to serve as a unit of account.

AB Bitcoin prevents double-spending using the blockchain, a public ledger kept with every client. Every single transaction till date is present in this ledger. Due to this, true anonymity is not present in bitcoin. We present a method to enhance anonymity in bitcoin-type cryptocurrencies. In the blockchain, each block holds a list of transactions linking the sending and receiving addresses. In our modified protocol the transactions (and blocks) do not contain any such links. Using this, we obtain a far higher degree of anonymity. Our method uses a new primitive known as composite signatures. Our security is based on the hardness of the Computation Diffie-Hellman assumption in bilinear maps.

TI Structures of building blocks in clusters of sweetpotato amylopectin
SO CARBOHYDRATE RESEARCH
AB phi,beta-Limit dextrins of domains and clusters of sweetpotato amylopectin were subjected to extensive hydrolysis by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase to release building blocks and reveal the internal structures of clusters. The composition of building blocks was analyzed by size-fractionation, gel permeation chromatography, and high performance anion exchange chromatography. Different domains and clusters had structurally similar building blocks with around three chains per building block and internal chain length around 2.9. Singly branched and doubly branched building blocks were the largest and second largest groups in the clusters. Type A clusters had more large building blocks and contained 5-6 blocks per cluster with an inter-block chain length (IB-CL) of 7.0, whereas type B clusters had less large building blocks and contained 3-4 blocks per cluster with IB-CL 7.9. Models on how the building blocks could be organized into type A and type B clusters are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A Secure Charging Scheme for Electric Vehicles With Smart Communities in
   Energy Blockchain
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of Energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by 'intrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract-based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. First, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Second, a reputation-based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Third, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs' individual needs for energy sources while maximizing the operator's utility. Furthermore, a novel energy allocation mechanism is proposed to allocate the limited renewable energy for EVs. Finally, extensive numerical results are carried out to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes.

TI Sex, Drugs, and Bitcoin: How Much Illegal Activity Is Financed through
   Cryptocurrencies?
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB Cryptocurrencies are among the largest unregulated markets in the world. We find that approximately one-quarter of bitcoin users are involved in illegal activity. We estimate that around 76 billion of illegal activity per year involve bitcoin (46% of bitcoin transactions), which is close to the scale of the U.S. and European markets for illegal drugs. The illegal share of bitcoin activity declines with mainstream interest in bitcoin and with the emergence of more opaque cryptocurrencies. The techniques developed in this paper have applications in cryptocurrency surveillance. Our findings suggest that cryptocurrencies are transforming the black markets by enabling black e-commerce.

TI Controllable and trustworthy blockchain-based cloud data management
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB In recent years, there have been efforts to deploy blockchain in a broad range of applications and in different domains, such as the critical infrastructure sectors. Generally, blockchain can be leveraged to establish a fair and transparent data sharing environment, where unauthorized modification to the data can be audited and traced. There are, however, known limitations of blockchain-based solutions, such as a significantly weakened networking control capability due to the distributed nature of such solutions. In addition, decisions recorded on a blockchain cannot be changed and there is the risk of majority attack (also known as 51% attack). Seeking to mitigate these limitations, in this paper we propose a controllable blockchain data management (CBDM) model that can be deployed in a cloud environment. We then evaluate its security and performance, in order to demonstrate utility. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Return and volatility spillovers among cryptocurrencies
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper measures interdependencies among 18 major cryptocurrencies and shows that (i) Bitcoin is the dominant contributor of return and volatility spillovers among all the sampled cryptocurrencies; (ii) return and volatility spillovers have risen steadily over time; (iii) there are 'spikes' in spillovers during major news events regarding cryptocurrencies. These findings suggest growing interdependence among cryptocurrencies and, by extension, a higher degree of contagion risk. It may be the case that cryptocurrencies are becoming more integrated, albeit this makes for interesting future empirical testing. In addition, the time-varying nature of spillovers reveals a certain dimension of uncertainty regarding the future of these digital currencies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Network causality structures among Bitcoin and other financial assets: A
   directed acyclic graph approach
SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB We use a data-driven methodology, namely the directed acyclic graph, to uncover the contemporaneous and lagged relations between Bitcoin and other asset classes. The adopted methodology allows us to identify causal networks based on the measurements of observed correlations and partial correlations, without relying on a priori assumptions. Results from the contemporaneous analysis indicate that the Bitcoin market is quite isolated, and no specific asset plays a dominant role in influencing the Bitcoin market. However, we find evidence of lagged relationships between Bitcoin and some assets, especially during the bear market state of Bitcoin. This finding suggests that the integration between the Bitcoin and other financial assets is a continuous process that varies over time. We conduct forecast error variance decompositions and find that the influence of each of the other assets on Bitcoin over a 20-day horizon does not account for more than 11% of all innovations.

TI Computation Offloading and Content Caching n Wireless Blockchain

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB Blockchain technology has been applied in a variety of fields due to its capability of establishing trust in a decentralized fashion. However, the application of blockchain in wireless mobile networks is hindered by a major challenge brought by the proof-of-work puzzle during the mining process, which sets a high demand for the computational capability and storage availability in mobile devices. To address this problem, we propose a novel mobile edge computing (MEC) enabled wireless blockchain framework where the computation-intensive mining tasks can be offloaded to nearby edge computing nodes and the cryptographic hashes of blocks can be cached in the MEC server. Particularly, two offloading modes are considered, i.e., offloaded to the nearby access point or a group of nearby users. First, we conduct the performance analysis of each mode with stochastic geometry methods. Then, the joint offloading decision and caching strategy is formulated as an optimization problem. Furthermore, an alternating direction method of multipliers based algorithm is utilized to solve the problem in a distributed manner. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

TI Research on agricultural supply chain system with double chain
   architecture based on blockchain technology
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB As an underlying support technology, blockchain is a shared ledger system and a computational paradigm, which is decentralized, and it is highly compatible with the distributed economic system. The distributed scheduling model of agricultural business resources based on the public service platform is a comprehensive solution to the current situation of agricultural industry which is "scattered, small, disorderly and weak", and plays an important role in integrating decentralized resource and making on-demand scheduling. Aiming at some key problems in the current Chinese public service platform, this paper proposes a public blockchain of agricultural supply chain system based on double chain architecture, mainly studying the dual chain structure and its storage mode, resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm. The results show that the chain of agricultural supply chain based on double chain structure can take into account the openness and security of transaction information and the privacy of enterprise information, can self-adaptively complete rent-seeking and matching of resources, and greatly enhance the credibility of the public service platform and the overall efficiency of the system.

TI TrustChain: Establishing Trust in the IoT-based Applications Ecosystem
   Using Blockchain
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has already reshaped and transformed our lives in many ways, ranging from how we communicate with people or manage our health to how we drive our cars and manage our homes. With the rapid development of the IoT ecosystem in a wide range of applications, IoT devices and data are going to be traded as commodities in the marketplace in the near future, similar to cloud services or physical objects. Developing such a trading platform has previously been identified as one of the key grand challenges in the integration of IoT and data science. Deployment of such a platform raises concerns about the security and privacy of data and devices since their ownership is hard to trace and manage without a central trusted authority. A central trusted authority is not a viable solution for a fully decentralized and distributed IoT ecosystem with a large number of distributed device vendors and consumers. Blockchain, as a decentralized system, removes the requirement for a trusted third-party by allowing participants to verify data correctness and ensure its immutability. IoT devices can use blockchain to register themselves and organize, store, and share streams of data effectively and reliably. We demonstrate the applicability of blockchain to IoT devices and data management with an aim of providing end-to-end trust for trading. We also give a brief introduction to the topics and challenges for future research toward developing a trustworthy trading platform for IoT ecosystems.

TI RBAC-SC: Role-Based Access Control Using Smart Contract
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The role-based access control (RBAC) framework is a mechanism that describes the access control principle. As a common interaction, an organization provides a service to a user who owns a certain role that was issued by a different organization. Such trans-organizational RBAC is common in face-to-face communication but not in a computer network, because it is difficult to establish both the security that prohibits the malicious impersonation of roles and the flexibility that allows small organizations to participate and users to fully control their own roles. In this paper, we present an RBAC using smart contract (RBAC-SC), a platform that makes use of Ethereum's smart contract technology to realize a trans organizational utilization of roles. Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that is designed to be secure, adaptable, and flexible. It pioneered smart contracts, which are decentralized applications that serve as "autonomous agents" running exactly as programmed and are deployed on a blockchain. The RBAC-SC uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the RBAC and to realize a challenge-response authentication protocol that verifies a user's ownership of roles. We describe the RBAC-SC framework, which is composed of two main parts, namely, the smart contract and the challenge-response protocol, and present a performance analysis. A prototype of the smart contract is created and deployed on Ethereum's Testnet blockchain, and the source code is publicly available.

TI GridMonitoring: Secured Sovereign Blockchain Based Monitoring on Smart
   Grid
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Electricity is the commonest commodity for most businesses in our world today. The use of electricity has been a breakthrough for the discovery of new technologies and has become the main driving force behind several innovations. With the introduction of smart grid systems, there have been improvements in how utility companies interact with their customers with regards to electricity use. However, since the readings are done via the Internet, there is the tendency for the data to be compromised when it gets into the hands of the wrong people. Moreover, customers mostly do not know why they pay huge amounts and which appliances use more electricity, since they are not privy to the readings. The sovereign blockchain technology, which provides transparency and provenance, is utilized in this paper to mitigate these above mentioned problems. A smart contract, which executes laid down procedures to provide a trust-based system between participants on the network is also implemented. Our system proves very efficient as the user can monitor how the electricity is used, and it also provides a platform where there is no manipulation from either party.

AB Smart contracts are programs running on cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains, whose popularity stem from the possibility to perform financial transactions, such as payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without need for any trusted third party. Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed.
   In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable code that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite. Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security properties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools for Ethereum smart contracts, thereby demonstrating once more the importance of rigorous semantic foundations for the design of security verification techniques.

AB Hyperledger Fabric is a flexible operating system for permissioned blockchains designed for business applications beyond the basic digital coin addressed by Bitcoin and other existing networks. A key property of this system is its extensibility, and in particular the support for multiple ordering services for building the blockchain. However, version 1 was launched in 2017 without an implementation of a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) ordering service. To overcome this limitation, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a BFT ordering service for this system on top of the BFT-SMART state machine replication/consensus library, with optimizations for wide-area deployment. Our results show that our ordering service can process up to ten thousand transactions per second and write a transaction irrevocably in the blockchain in half a second, even with peers spread across different continents.

AB In its first decade, Bitcoin has not proven to be a practical money form for most circumstances, but it has become a staging ground for debate around the cultural role of money in society. This debate is poised between two related but ultimately incompatible techno-economic imaginaries: infrastructural mutualism and digital metallism. Each offers a theory not just of money, but also of relations, identities, and the larger imaginaries we call society' and the economy'. In particular, they offer distinct visions of what it means to be a peer' in a peer-to-peer money system, and perhaps, a peer-to-peer society. This article traces the pre-history of Bitcoin, as well as more recent developments, to inquire about its future, as well as the future of money more broadly.

TI Blockchain Technology Use Cases in Healthcare
SO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: PLATFORMS, TOOLS AND USE CASES
SE Advances in Computers
AB Blockchain technology alleviates the reliance on a centralized authority to certify information integrity and ownership, as well as mediate transactions and exchange of digital assets, while enabling secure and pseudoanonymous transactions along with agreements directly between interacting parties. It possesses key properties, such as immutability, decentralization, and transparency, which potentially address pressing issues in healthcare, such as incomplete records at point of care and difficult access to patients' own health information. An efficient and effective healthcare system requires interoperability, which allows software apps and technology platforms to communicate securely and seamlessly, exchange data, and use the exchanged data across health organizations and app vendors. Unfortunately, healthcare today suffers from siloed and fragmented data, delayed communications, and disparate workflow tools caused by the lack of interoperability. Blockchain offers the opportunity to enable access to longitudinal, complete, and tamper-aware medical records that are stored in fragmented systems in a secure and pseudoanonymous fashion. This chapter focuses on the applicability of Blockchain technology in healthcare by (1) identifying potential Blockchain use cases in healthcare, (2) providing a case study that implements Blockchain technology, and (3) evaluating design considerations when applying this technology in healthcare.

TI BeeKeeper: A Blockchain-Based IoT System With Secure Storage and
   Homomorphic Computation
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies are experiencing exponential growth in academia and industry. Generally, IoT is a centralized system whose security and performance mainly rely on centralized servers. Therefore, users have to trust the centralized servers; in addition, it is difficult to coordinate external computing resources to improve the performance of IoT. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide this decentralization, high credibility and high security. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT may become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based threshold IoT service system: BeeKeeper. In the BeeKeeper system, servers can process a user's data by performing homomorphic computations on the data without learning anything from them. Furthermore, any node can become a leader's server if the node and the leader desire so. In this way, BeeKeeper's performance can continually increase by attracting external computing resources to join in it. Moreover, malicious nodes can be scrutinized. In addition, BeeKeeper is fault tolerant since a user's BeeKeeper protocol may work smoothly as long as a threshold number of its servers are active and honest. Finally, we deploy BeeKeeper on the Ethereum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation. In our experiments, servers can generate their response with about 107 ms. Moreover, the performance of BeeKeeper mainly depends on the blockchain platform. For instance, the response time is about 22.5 s since the block interval of Ethereum blockchain is about 15 s. In fact, if we use some other blockchain with short block interval, the response time may be obviously short.

TI Current Trends in Sustainability of Bitcoins and Related Blockchain
   Technology
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Bitcoin is a digital currency based on a peer-to-peer payment system managed by an open source software and characterized by lower transaction costs, greater security and scalability than fiat money and no need of a central bank. Despite criticisms about illegal uses and social consequences, it is attracting the interest of the scientific community. The purpose of this work is to define and evaluate the current trends of the literature concerned with the sustainability of bitcoin, considering the environmental impacts, social issues and economic aspects. From the analysis it emerges that the transition of the whole monetary system in the new cryptocurrency will result in an unacceptable amount of energy consumed to mine new bitcoins and to maintain the entire virtual monetary system, and probably bitcoin will remain a niche currency. Blockchain, which is the base for a distributed and democratically-sustained public ledger of the transactions, could foster new and challenging opportunities. Sharing the framework of medical data, energy generation and distribution in micro-grids at the citizen level, block-stack and new state-driven cryptocurrencies, may benefit from the wide spread of blockchain-based transactions. Under the perspective of its being a driver of social change, bitcoins and related blockchain technologies may overcome the issues highlighted by numerous detractors.

AB Collatz conjecture (or 3x+1 problem) has been explored for about 80 years. By now the largest number that has been verified for Collatz conjecture is about 60 bits. In this paper, we propose new algorithms that can verify much greater numbers than known algorithms, i.e., about 100000 bits (30000 digits) on whether they can return 1 after 3*x+1 and x/2 computations. The proposed algorithms change numerical computation to bit computation (or logical computation), and change inner memory data representation to hard disk file manipulation. We make it possible to verify extremely large numbers without concerning computer memory upper-bound. The largest number verified for Collatz conjecture until now in the world is 2(100000) - 1, and this magnitude of extremely large numbers has never been verified. We discovered that this number can return to 1 after 481603 times of 3*x+1 computation, and 863323 times of x/2 computation. At last, we stress that some open problems may be used for the green mining in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, e.g., BTC. We discuss the applicability of Collatz conjecture for the Proof of Work in Blockchain.

TI The acceptance of blockchain technology in meat traceability and
   transparency
SO BRITISH FOOD JOURNAL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate meat traceability by outlining the different perspectives and opinions of meat supply chain stakeholders (SCSs); it also evaluates potential of acceptance of blockchain technology (BCT) as a viable transparency and traceability system (TTS).
   Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire survey of 141 consumers reveals their opinions about TTSs. In addition, semi-structured interviews with seven retail managers, four government officials and one blockchain service provider (Project Provenance Ltd) provide expert insights.
   Findings The results demonstrate that consumers are overwhelmed by the amount and complexity of certification labels. As a TTS, BCT implementation appears to have significant positive influences on consumers' purchasing decisions, mediated by consumers' quality perceptions. This study reveals the discordant perspectives of different stakeholders with regard to the importance of a BCT-based TTS.
   Originality/value This study investigates current TTSs and certification labels, and probes customer perception of a potential BCT-based solution for meat traceability. Changes to supply chains' mentality and the active establishment of trust in BCT applications are needed. Firms should take both holistic and altruistic views to deal with the challenges of TTSs in the meat supply chain. The adoption of BCT, in combination with DNA coding, seems promising as a solution to many of the issues that currently plague TTSs.

SO JOURNAL OF BANKING AND FINANCE LAW AND PRACTICE
AB Blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been heralded as a key disrupter in the fintech space. As often occurs with disruptive technologies, the issue has arisen that the uptake of DLT in the banking and finance industry is likely to outpace the adoption of sufficiently robust legislation. In Australia, the absence of a clear legal framework for the use of DLT not only increases the risk of inefficiencies being realised, but also threatens DLT's disruptive potential. The failure of regulators to understand the nuances of DLT and to implement a targeted legislative regime, aligned with international standards, could have severe consequences, from both a practical and legal perspective.

AB Adding blockchain technology to existing systems instead of building them from the ground up poses several challenges. It is difficult to find out which attributes of blockchains are important for a given use case (e.g. immutable, trustless, anonymous) and to decide which elements of an architecture should employ blockchain technologies. Current approaches generally only give a hint on whether blockchain technology makes sense for a given use case or not. This paper proposes a more fine-grained approach to decide which elements of an application architecture could benefit from the use of blockchain technology. We illustrate the first outline of our approach which identifies participants, their trust relations and interactions to derive a hybrid architecture (i.e., an architecture embedding blockchain technology in existing software systems or creating new systems using blockchain only in certain parts).

TI THE DISTRIBUTED LIABILITY OF DISTRIBUTED LEDGERS: LEGAL RISKS OF
   BLOCKCHAIN
SO UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW
AB The transformative potential of distributed ledger technology ("DLT"), especially in the financial sector, is attracting enormous interest. Many financial institutions are investing heavily in proof-of-concept demonstrations and the rollout of pilot applications of DLT technology. Part of the attraction of distributed ledger systems such as Blockchain lies in transcending law and regulation. From a technological perspective, DLT is generally seen as offering unbreakable security, immutability, and unparalleled transparency, making law and regulation unnecessary. Yet while the law may be dull and the technology exciting, the impact of the law cannot be simply wished away. With data distributed among many ledgers, legal risk remains. DLT projects may well be found by courts to constitute joint ventures, with liability spread across all owners and operators of systems serving as distributed ledgers. Instead of being subject to law nowhere, organizers may instead be subject to the law wherever there are system users. Regulators seeking to support appropriate approaches to twenty-first century financial infrastructure must focus on these legal consequences.

Currently, different solutions were applied to Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Grids, Supply Chains, Industry, and Vehicular Networks scenarios. Despite of that, the main advantages on the adoption of different architectures, models and algorithms proposed in the state of art of blockchain in IoT scenarios are not yet clear. This paper presents some discussion about the usage of blockchain technology in IoT environments and proposes a layer model of blockchains for IoT. In addition, we present an overview of the latest research regarding network architectures, consensus algorithms, data management, and applications. Finally, this paper presents open issues and future trends about blockchain in IoT.

TI The Problem of Social Order: What Should We Count as Law?
SO LAW AND SOCIAL INQUIRY-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION
AB In these two fine contributions to the relatively small body of empirically-grounded theoretical accounts of law, Fred Schauer and Richard McAdams focus on the two key elements of any legal system: the coordination of conduct that individuals have an incentive to engage in if they believe others will also, and the coercive force that is needed to deter conduct when coordination incentives are absent or insufficient. Both contributions deepen our understanding of the dynamics of coordination and coercion. But both also focus primarily on the concept of law as a set of rules generated and enforced exclusively by government. In this comment, drawing on recent work with Barry Weingast, I emphasize the importance of extending the scope of analysis to include settings in which governments are missing or weak and where legal order has not yet been achieved or stabilizedthe challenge that faces many poor and developing countries around the world and the challenge that today's advanced legal regimes overcame historically. In our account, coordination and coercion are not substitute mechanisms, but are deeply linked: prior to the establishment of wealthy stable governments (and perhaps even in the presence of such governments), coercive penalties are delivered only if the decentralized application of punishment by ordinary individuals is successfully coordinated and incentivized.

TI Fake News: A Technological Approach to Proving the Origins of Content,
   Using Blockchains
SO BIG DATA
AB In this article, we introduce a prototype of an innovative technology for proving the origins of captured digital media. In an era of fake news, when someone shows us a video or picture of some event, how can we trust its authenticity? It seems that the public no longer believe that traditional media is a reliable reference of fact, perhaps due, in part, to the onset of many diverse sources of conflicting information, via social media. Indeed, the issue of fake reached a crescendo during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, when the winner, Donald Trump, claimed that The New York Times was trying to discredit him by pushing disinformation. Current research into overcoming the problem of fake news does not focus on establishing the ownership of media resources used in such storiesthe blockchain-based application introduced in this article is technology that is capable of indicating the authenticity of digital media. Put simply, using the trust mechanisms of blockchain technology, the tool can show, beyond doubt, the provenance of any source of digital media, including images used out of context in attempts to mislead. Although the application is an early prototype and its capability to find fake resources is somewhat limited, we outline future improvements that would overcome such limitations. Furthermore, we believe that our application (and its use of blockchain technology and standardized metadata) introduces a novel approach to overcoming falsities in news reporting and the provenance of media resources used therein. However, while our application has the potential to be able to verify the originality of media resources, we believe that technology is only capable of providing a partial solution to fake news. That is because it is incapable of proving the authenticity of a news story as a whole. We believe that takes human skills.

TI Behavioural Verification: Preventing Report Fraud in Decentralized
   Advert Distribution Systems
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Service commissions, which are claimed by Ad-Networks and Publishers, are susceptible to forgery as non-human operators are able to artificially create fictitious traffic on digital platforms for the purpose of committing financial fraud. This places a significant strain on Advertisers who have no effective means of differentiating fabricated Ad-Reports from those which correspond to real consumer activity. To address this problem, we contribute an advert reporting system which utilizes opportunistic networking and a blockchain-inspired construction in order to identify authentic Ad-Reports by determining whether they were composed by honest or dishonest users. What constitutes a user's honesty for our system is the manner in which they access adverts on their mobile device. Dishonest users submit multiple reports over a short period of time while honest users behave as consumers who view adverts at a balanced pace while engaging in typical social activities such as purchasing goods online, moving through space and interacting with other users. We argue that it is hard for dishonest users to fake honest behaviour and we exploit the behavioural patterns of users in order to classify Ad-Reports as real or fabricated. By determining the honesty of the user who submitted a particular report, our system offers a more secure reward-claiming model which protects against fraud while still preserving the user's anonymity.

TI Bitcoin and entrepreneurship: breaking the network effect
SO REVIEW OF AUSTRIAN ECONOMICS
AB This paper explores the question of whether the market process is capable of bringing about a spontaneous monetary switch to a new currency in the presence of strong network effects of the incumbent currency as well as the absence of contingencies such as extreme inflation or political instability. It does so by examining current happenings around Bitcoin. It finds that two mechanisms stand out: the coordinating efforts of the profit-maximizing entrepreneur as well as the ability to use the old and the new currency simultaneously. Specifically, it finds that marginal decisions made by rational agents merely seeking to maximize net private benefit irrespective of the network effect, be it entrepreneurs or users of the new currency, are capable of setting in motion a switch to a new currency. Whether or not these mechanisms play out fully in the case of Bitcoin still remains to be seen.

TI Economic stability under alternative banking systems: Theory and policy
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STABILITY
AB In this paper we show in a thought experiment that in an economy where i) investors hold rational expectations, ii) output is generated by a linear homogeneous production function, and iii) real investment is allocated across sectors according to the CAPM, a fractional reserve banking system is not Pareto efficient and amplifies the business cycle. In developing these results we show that these three well known propositions in economics also imply a new view of the business cycle, one where the business cycle is described in terms of the dispersion of an ex-ante probability distribution. The policy implication of this analysis is that bank regulation should go further than the Volcker rule or the Vickers commission proposal by restricting bank investments to currency and deposit accounts on the central bank. Non bank financial institutions should then carry out the financial intermediation function now carried out by banks. The paper proposes that post office banking perhaps augmented with blockchain technology sometime in the future is one way to implement the transition from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking. While little academic work has been done on full reserve banking in the aftermath of the Great Crisis, it is interesting to note that it is part of banking reform proposals now (July 2016) before the parliament in Iceland and a special national referendum in Switzerland.

   Objectives: The aim of the present study was to design and characterize a novel microemulsion system as an ocular delivery system for Azithromycin and evaluate its physicochemical characteristics and rabbit corneal permeability in order to enhance the penetration of the drug.
   Methods: The prepared microemulsions (MEs) were assessed for their viscosity, pH, particle size, surface tension, DSC, stability, in vitro drug release, and corneal rabbit permeability. In this study, a full factorial design was employed with 3 variables at 2 levels for preparing 8 formulations and data analysis.
   Results: The results showed that the average droplet size of ME formulations was in the range of 6.78 to 26.65 nm while pH values were 5.1 to 5.7 and viscosity range was 115 - 361 cps. Drug release profile revealed that 79.066% of the drug released in 24 hours of the experiment. The maximum and minimum percentages of drug permeated through rabbit cornea were observed in MEA-7 (12.87%) and MEA-2 (0.909%), respectively. All ME formulations with different compositions and properties significantly increased partitioning, flux, and permeability coefficient from rabbit cornea. Dapp and Papp parameters in MEA-1 and MEA-7 formulations were 0.00882 cm(2)h(-1) and 2.391 cmh(-1), which were 17.65, 35.17 times higher than those of control (AZ suspension, 1%), respectively. The flux (Jss) of Azithromycin in MEA-7 was 11.958 mg cm(-2)h(-1), which was 39.86 times higher than that of control.
   Conclusions: The present study showed that any change in the content and composition of ME could change physicochemical properties and permeability parameters during drug permeation of ME formulations. The phenomenon may be due to the cornea structural changes in presence of ME components.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY
AB Densely sulfonated poly(fluorenyl ether sulfone) block copolymers (DS-PFESs) of various hydrophilic and hydrophobic oligomer block lengths were prepared, and the effect of the block length on the membranes' physicochemical and electrical properties was systematically investigated. Although the conductivity increased with the block length, a morphological analysis identified an optimal chain length. Further increases in the chain length resulted in the formation of larger ionic cluster clumps that caused a significant loss in the phase separation and, hence the dimensional/mechanical stability. The DS-9-32 membrane, prepared with a hydrophilic and hydrophobic block length of 9:32, displayed a well-balanced hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase separation and a high conductivity, together with a high dimensional/mechanical stability.

AB Cloud services are becoming increasingly globalized and data-center workloads are expanding exponentially. GPU and FPGA-based clouds have illustrated improvements in power and performance by accelerating compute-intensive workloads. ASIC-based clouds are a promising way to optimize the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of a given datacenter computation (e.g. YouTube transcoding) by reducing both energy consumption and marginal computation cost.
   The feasibility of an ASIC Cloud for a particular application is directly gated by the ability to manage the Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) costs of designing and fabricating the ASIC, so that it is significantly lower (e.g. 2x) than the TCO of the best available alternative.
   In this paper, we show that technology node selection is a major tool for managing ASIC Cloud NRE, and allows the designer to trade off an accelerator's excess energy efficiency and cost performance for lower total cost. We explore NRE and cross-technology optimization of ASIC Clouds for four different applications: Bitcoin mining, YouTube-style video transcoding, Litecoin, and Deep Learning. We address these challenges and show large reductions in the NRE, potentially enabling ASIC Clouds to address a wider variety of datacenter workloads. Our results suggest that advanced nodes like 16nm will lead to sub-optimal TCO for many workloads, and that use of older nodes like 65nm can enable a greater diversity of ASIC Clouds.

TI Bitcoin beyond ambivalence: Popular rationalization and Feenberg's
   technical politics
SO THESIS ELEVEN
AB In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin emerged as an alternative monetary system that could circumvent political and financial authorities. A practice in libertarian prefigurative politics, Bitcoin demonstrates the capacity for online subgroups to creatively appropriate internet-based technologies to enact alternative futures. Andrew Feenberg's critical theory of technology clarifies this capacity and outlines the significance of agency in technical action. As technology mediates many social relations, it has a significant role in the reproduction of social power. Technological agency is therefore a crucial site of resistance in which users can form alternative, democratic rationalizations of technology. Yet are such instances of agency intrinsically democratic? In analysing this aspect of Feenberg's theory, this article argues that Bitcoin represents a popular rationalization' of technology - a creative appropriation of technology that empowers some groups while lacking the ethical justification necessary to be considered democratic.

AB The IoT is pervading our daily activities and lives with devices scattered all over our cities, transport systems, buildings, homes and bodies. This invasion of devices with sensors and communication capabilities brings big concerns, mainly about the privacy and confidentiality of the collected information. These concerns hinder the wide adoption of the IoT. To overcome them, in this work, we present an Blockchain-based architecture for IoT access authorizations. Following the IoT tendency requirements, our architecture is user transparent, user friendly, fully decentralized, scalable, fault tolerant and compatible with a wide range of today's access control models used in the IoT. Finally, our architecture also has a secure way to establish relationships between users, devices and group of both, allowing the assignment of attributes for these relationships and their use in the access control authorization.

AB Ransomware are a recent scareware, a threat that is increasing gradually for last couple of years. Usually it encrypts users's files or steal/delete important information and holds the decryption key until a ransom is paid by the victim, which is mostly in bitcoins due to their untraceable properties. In this work, we have conducted a survey to comprehend more than 40 papers that consists of Windows based ransomware families from last 4 years by creating a benchmark for evaluating ransomware attacking methodologies, payment methods. Thus, providing a way of instigating for other researchers to come out with some new solutions to control their growth and to avoid their attacks. This work would be the ultimate opportunity to expand and organize research efforts in future work by applying some early preventions and strategies to defeat these malicious software's.

AB With the advent of numerous online content providers, utilities and applications, each with their own specific version of privacy policies and its associated overhead, it is becoming increasingly difficult for concerned users to manage and track the confidential information that they share with the providers. We have developed a novel framework to automatically track details about how a user's PII is stored, used and shared by the provider. We have integrated our data privacy ontology with the properties of blockchain, to develop an automated access-control and audit mechanism that enforces users' data privacy policies when sharing their data across third parties. We have also validated this framework by implementing a working system LinkShare. In this paper, we describe our framework on detail along with the LinkShare system. Our approach can be adopted by big data users to automatically apply their privacy policy on data operations and track the flow of that data across various stakeholders.

AB One of the major concerns on today's Software Defined Network (SDN) is to enhance its security. Files sharing in SDN can be made much more secured against fraudulent activities by the implementation of blockchain technology. When the privacy of network's users is increased, the reliability of system increases correspondingly. Blockchain Security over SDN (BSS) is proposed which protects privacy and availability of resources against non-trusting members.
   Mininet emulator is used for simulating custom SDN network topology. OpenDaylight controller is integrated with OpenStack controller. For cloud data storage, OpenStack platform is used. For testing purpose of Blockchain, Pyethereum tester tool under Ethereum platform is implemented. Serpent programming is used for creating contract in the blockchain. BSS facilitates files sharing among SDN users in distributed peer-to-peer basis using OpenStack as a cloud storage platform.

AB In this paper, we consider the issue of trust and trust-related factors in the context of decentralized applications running on public blockchain platforms such as Ethereum. These decentralized applications emphasize a lack of reliance on a trusted third party, and are marketed as applications that cannot be censored or stopped. To determine whether either social trust or technology trust applies in these cases, we examine the extent to which these applications could be considered to be out of the control of a third party, by qualitatively analyzing how developers define the characteristics of decentralization, trustlessness and autonomy. The results show that although decentralized applications' websites make reference to these concepts, they are not defined in the same way. In cases where there is no mention of either of these concepts, it is therefore difficult to say which definitions are assumed. In addition, we also found contradictions in the characterization of the level of developer control. We discuss these findings in the context of research on user trust and propose future research directions.

AB Bitcoin is an open source payment system with a market capitalization of about 15 G$. During the years several key management solutions have been proposed to enhance bitcoin. The common characteristic of these techniques is that they allow to derive public keys independently of the private keys, and that these keys match. In this paper we overview the historical development of such techniques, specify and compare all major variants proposed or used in practical systems. We show that such techniques can be designed based on 2 distinct ECC arithmetic properties and how to combine both. A major trend in blockchain systems is to use by Stealth Address (SA) techniques to make different payments made to the same payee unlikable. We review all known SA techniques and show that early variants are less secure. Finally we propose a new SA method which is more robust against leakage and against various attacks.

AB The aim of this article is to study the theoretical, methodological, and legal possibilities of application of certain types of legal responsibility to the relations, which are connected with cryptocurrency (bitcoin). Some types of liability in the field of cryptocurrency relations make the subject of the study. Methodology. The research is based on a comparison of legal regulation of the sphere of cryptocurrency in Ukraine and in foreign countries. Advantages and disadvantages of different modes of cryptocurrency turnover are determined: from direct prohibition to granting the status of the official payment system. It is made on the basis of the analysis of peculiarities of the circulation of virtual money in Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, China, the Russian Federation, Bolivia, Ecuador, Thailand, Vietnam, the USA, Japan, Spain, and some other countries. On the basis of the comparative legal study of certain provisions of the civil, administrative, tort, and criminal legislation of Ukraine, the possibilities and limits of the application of certain types of legal responsibility to violations in the field of cryptocurrency are determined. The results of the comparative legal study have shown that, unlike most foreign countries, in Ukraine, there is no legislative consolidation of the legal status of the virtual currency. In this regard, today in the national legislation, there are no direct rules that would predict the occurrence of administrative, criminal or civil liability for the offenses in the field of cryptocurrency relations. Practical impact. Since guarantees of compulsory restoration or protection of violated law play an important role in the legal regulation of any social relations, the proper legislative regulation of public relations in the sphere of crypto currency circulation is an urgent problem today, including with the help of establishing liability for the offenses in this field. Correlation/Authenticity. Comparative and legal research of legal regulation of the sphere of crypto currency gives us a better understanding of the most promising directions of development of administrative, criminal, and civil liability in this field.

AB One of the fundamental applications for a practically useful system of money is remuneration. Information pertaining to the amount of compensation awarded to different individuals is often considered sensitive, commanding a certain degree of privacy. As Bitcoin and similarly designed cryptocurrencies evolve into a recognized medium of exchange for larger swaths of the world economy, an increasing number of people will earn income in the form of blockchain-based payments. The nature of these transactions is such that the minute details of an affected individuals compensation package and spending habits will be exposed to public scrutiny. In some cases this violates cultural norms which respect the confidentiality of salaries, yet in other cases it could be regarded as providing the benefits associated with greater transparency. In this work we analyse the Bitcoin blockchain record of periodic payments accruing to an individual address in exchange for goods or services rendered. For differing levels of available information we seek to determine the extent of insights that can be gleaned about the transacting counter-parties and the privacy implications this entails.

AB Onion sites on the darkweb operate using the Tor Hidden Service (HS) protocol to shield their locations on the Internet, which (among other features) enables these sites to host malicious and illegal content while being resistant to legal action and seizure. Identifying and monitoring such illicit sites in the darkweb is of high relevance to the Computer Security and Law Enforcement communities. We have developed an automated infrastructure that crawls and indexes content from onion sites into a large-scale data repository, called LIGHTS, with over 100M pages. In this paper we describe Automated Tool for Onion Labeling (ATOL), a novel scalable analysis service developed to conduct a thematic assessment of the content of onion sites in the LIGHTS repository. ATOL has three core components - (a) a novel keyword discovery mechanism (ATOL Keyword) which extends analyst-provided keywords for different categories by suggesting new descriptive and discriminative keywords that are relevant for the categories; (b) a classification framework (ATOLClassify) that uses the discovered keywords to map onion site content to a set of categories when sufficient labeled data is available; (c) a clustering framework (ATOLCluster) that can leverage information from multiple external heterogeneous knowledge sources, ranging from domain expertise to Bitcoin transaction data, to categorize onion content in the absence of sufficient supervised data. The paper presents empirical results of ATOL on onion datasets derived from the LIGHTS repository, and additionally benchmarks ATOL's algorithms on the publicly available 20 News groups dataset to demonstrate the reproducibility of its results. On the LIGHTS dataset, ATOLClassify gives a 12% performance gain over an analyst-provided baseline, while ATOLCluster gives a 7% improvement over state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms. We also discuss how ATOL has been deployed and externally evaluated, as part of the LIGHTS system.

TI A Knowledge-Based Analysis of the Blockchain Protocol
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB At the heart of the Bitcoin is a blockchain protocol, a protocol for achieving consensus on a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions. To the extent that a blockchain protocol is used for applications such as contract signing and making certain transactions (such as house sales) public, we need to understand what guarantees the protocol gives us in terms of agents' knowledge. Here, we provide a complete characterization of agent's knowledge when running a blockchain protocol using a variant of common knowledge that takes into account the fact that agents can enter and leave the system, it is not known which agents are in fact following the protocol (some agents may want to deviate if they can gain by doing so), and the fact that the guarantees provided by blockchain protocols are probabilistic. We then consider some scenarios involving contracts and show that this level of knowledge suffices for some scenarios, but not others.

AB The effectiveness of distributed Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications heavily relies on the cooperation of mobile users. Each user should receive a satisfying reward to compensate its resource consumption for cooperation. However, suitable incentive mechanisms that can meet the diverse requirements of users in dynamic and distributed P2P environments are still missing. Therefore in this paper, we propose a Bitcoin based incentive mechanism for distributed P2P applications that applies the basic idea of Bitcoin to incentivize users for cooperation. In this mechanism, users who help with a successful delivery get rewarded. Through a game theoretical analysis and evaluation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and security strength of our proposed incentive mechanism.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate a blockchain-based solution for transparently managing and analyzing data in a pay-as-you-go car insurance application. This application allows drivers who rarely use cars to only pay insurance premium for particular trips they would like to travel. One of the key challenges from database perspective is how to ensure all the data pertaining to the actual trip and premium payment made by the users are transparently recorded so that every party in the insurance contract including the driver, the insurance company, and the financial institution is confident that the data are tamper-proof and traceable.
   Another challenge from information retrieval perspective is how to perform entity matching and pattern matching on customer data as well as their trip and claim history recorded on the blockchain for intelligent fraud detection. Last but not least, the drivers' trip history, once have been collected sufficiently, can be much valuable for the insurance company to do offline analysis and build statistics on past driving behaviour and past vehicle runtime. These statistics enable the insurance company to offer the users with transparent and individualized insurance quotes. Towards this end, we develop a blockchain-based solution for micro-insurance applications that transparently keeps records and executes smart contracts depending on runtime conditions while also connecting with off-chain analytic databases.

AB Future electricity distribution grids will host a considerable share of variable renewable energy sources and local storage resources. Moreover, they will face new load structures due for example to the growth of the electric vehicle market. These trends raise the need for new paradigms for distribution grids operation, in which Distribution System Operators will increasingly rely on demand side flexibility and households will progressively become prosumers playing an active role on smart grid energy management. However, in present energy management architectures, the lack of coordination among actors limits the capability of the grid to enable the mentioned trends. In this paper we tackle this problem by proposing an architecture that enables households to autonomously exchange energy blocks and flexibility services with neighbors, operators and market actors. The solution is based on a blockchain transactive platform. We focus on a market application, where households can trade energy with their neighbors, aimed to locally balancing renewable energy production. We propose a market mechanism and dynamic transport prices that provide an incentive for households to locally manage energy resources in a way that responds to both prosumer and operator needs. We evaluate the impact of such markets through comprehensive simulations using power flow analysis and realistic load profiles, providing valuable insight for the design of appropriate mechanisms and incentives.

AB With the popularity of electric vehicles, more and more charging piles were built. All of the private piles only serve for their owners, and are left unused for a longer time comparing to public piles. In order to keep private piles busier, meanwhile providing alternatives to electric vehicle users when charging, this paper designs a resolution for sharing private piles using block-chain and smart contract. Without the third party, we can do untrusted payment between strangers after charging; the access control strategy in this resolution protect the data privacy of transactions.

AB Portfolio management is the decision-making process of allocating an amount of fund into different financial investment products. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. This paper presents a model-less convolutional neural network with historic prices of a set of financial assets as its input, outputting portfolio weights of the set. The network is trained with 0.7 years' price data from a cryptocurrency exchange. The training is done in a reinforcement manner, maximizing the accumulative return, which is regarded as the reward function of the network. Back test trading experiments with trading period of 30 minutes is conducted in the same market, achieving 10-fold returns in 1.8 month's periods. Some recently published portfolio selection strategies are also used to perform the same back tests, whose results are compared with the neural network. The network is not limited to cryptocurrency, but can be applied to any other financial markets.

AB Existing data management and searching system for Internet of Things uses centralized database. For this reason, security vulnerabilities are found in this system which consists of server such as IP spoofing, single point of failure and Sybil attack This paper proposes data management system is based on blockchain which ensures security by using ECDSA digital signature and SHA-256 hash function. Location that is indicated as IP address of data owner and data name are transcribed in block which is included in the blockchain. Furthermore, we devise data manegement and searching method through analyzing block hash value. By using security properties of blockchain such as authentication, non-repudiation and data integrity, this system has advantage of security comparing to previous data management and searching system using centralized database or P2P networks.

AB In this "post truth" age of "fake news" and "alternative facts" uncertainty in the provenance of policy makes transparency in decision making increasingly important for evidence-based policymakers. This paper demonstrates how the convergence of Agent Based Modelling, Smart Contracts, Blockchain, and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies make possible the development of participatory decision support frameworks. The concept is demonstrated in a public health context by implementing an Agent Based Model of disease spread within a simulated population (SIR model) as a so-called Smart Contract deployed on a public Blockchain network. We demonstrate that in order to "close the loop" the simulation outcomes can be visualized using commodity VR hardware, and future extensions towards fully interactive simulations are proposed.

AB In recent years, Blockchain technology has been highly valued, and the related applications have begun to be developed in large numbers. A smart contract is a software component encompass business logics and transactions that run on a blockchain. Thus, verifying whether the contract logics fully reflect the business requirements are one of the most important software engineering issues in blockchain application development. Currently, developing smart contracts is still a challenging task even for experienced programmers due to the lacking of an integrated tool for developing and testing. In response to this challenge, this paper presents a service platform that supports BDD-style (Behavior-Driven Development) smart contract development, testing, and deployment for the Ethereum-based blockchains. This platform focuses on providing and resolving the cross-cutting concerns across the life-cycle of smart contract development. The feasibility of this platform is shown by demonstrating how an application scenario, namely, loyalty points exchange, can be implemented using the proposed platform. Our experiences indicate that the burdens of developers when developing smart contracts can be effectively reduced and thus increases the quality of contracts.

AB Bitcoin, the arguably most popular cryptocurrency to date, allows users to perform transactions using freely chosen pseudonymous addresses. Previous research, however, suggests that these pseudonyms can easily be linked, implying a lower level of privacy than originally expected. To obfuscate the links between pseudonyms, different mixing methods have been proposed. One of the first approaches is the CoinJoin concept, where multiple users merge their transactions into one larger transaction. In theory, CoinJoin can be used to mix and transact bitcoins simultaneously, in one step. Yet, it is expected that differing bitcoin amounts would allow an attacker to derive the original single transactions. Solutions based on CoinJoin therefore prescribe the use of fixed bitcoin amounts and cannot be used to perform arbitrary transactions.
   In this paper, we define a model for CoinJoin transactions and metrics that allow conclusions about the provided anonymity. We generate and analyze CoinJoin transactions and show that with differing, representative amounts they generally do not provide any significant anonymity gains. As a solution to this problem, we present an output splitting approach that introduces sufficient ambiguity to effectively prevent linking in CoinJoin transactions. Furthermore, we discuss how this approach could be used in Bitcoin today.

AB Factoring is an important financial instrument for SMEs to solve liquidity problems, where the invoice is cashed to avoid late buyer payments. Unfortunately, this business model is risky as it relies on human interaction and involved actors (factors in particular) suffer from information asymmetry. One of the risks involved is 'double-financing': the event that an SME extracts funds from multiple factors. To reduce this asymmetry and increase the scalability of this important instrument, we propose a framework, DecReg, based on blockchain technology. We provide the protocols designed for this framework and present performance analysis. This framework will be deployed in practice as of February 2017 in the Netherlands.

In addition the advantages and disadvantages are pointed out as well as other applications. Results from the survey suggest that many experts are investigating the new technology, but the efforts made at Austrian, German and Swiss banks are low since there are still many open issues pending. Especially setting up a legal framework for the international treatment of payment transactions based on the blockchain would be an important step.

AB This conceptual research reflects the understanding of the wider and more coherent use of crypto-currencies and Blockchain' algorithms for the security and equity of operations. This is especially important for the transactions between the collective actors on different hierarchical positions, e.g., the State and private companies or associations, or individuals. The fog computing' hardware and software are helpful for the aims of improving taxation and ensuring reliability of any transactions. The neuron technologies provide creating and developing a multi-criteria assessment of assets or actions, which represent more correct system of affective and socially acceptable evaluations, than it can be calculated on the basis of the cognitive judgments. The ability to provide a high level of information security through systems like Etherium allows of building a reliable and transparent system of taxation and of regulation of all interactions between social, economic and political agents, including the financial and non-financial measurements.

AB Bitcoin as concept was coined in 2009 and can be described as a partly open and shared transactional database. What makes bitcoin unique is that for the first time, we can prove and move ownership of anything digital without a central authority. The technology facilitates many benefits, one being a worldwide, digital currency and we observe that some stores allow payments in bitcoin. Drawing on concepts from the Diffusion of Innovation theory we investigated: What are the end-users' motivations and barriers for using bitcoin as digital currency? Through a small survey, we collected 135 answers during the summer of 2016. Our findings include that the bitcoin users embrace bitcoin due to technological curiosity, thus an individual reason. The largest group, the non-users, state that they are awaiting for others to start using bitcoin, as they question the value and security issues. We conclude that we may witness a deadlock where "everybody waits for everybody", and that more research is needed. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB With the successful deployment of wireless networks such as cellular and Wi-Fi networks as well as development of lightweight hand-held devices, wireless communication became the fastest growing sector in communication industry and wireless networks have been part of every business. Over 25 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020. Because of exponentially increasing number of connected devices, we have Internet of Things (IoT) enabled applications that offer socioeconomic benefits. Different IoT applications have different operational requirements and constraints. For instance, IoT enabled transportation cyber-physical system needs lowest latency and high data rate, IoT enabled financial systems or banks need high security to support mobile banking, IoT enabled manufacturing systems need high resiliency to combat fault tolerance and cyber-attacks, IoT enabled cyber-physical power system needs the least latency and highest resiliency to avoid power outage caused by faults or cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose wireless network virtualization to create different virtual wireless networks (VWNs) through mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) to support different IoT enabled systems with diverse requirements and resiliency. Wireless virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization, provide better coverage, increase network capacity, enhance energy efficiency and provide security. In order to prevent double-spending (allocating same frequency to multiple network providers) of wireless resources, we have proposed to use blockchain based approach which provides quality-of-service to users. Furthermore, IoT is expected to generate massive amount of data (aka big data), we consider edge computing to process big data when individual devices have limited computing/processing and storage capabilities. Moreover, network segmentation through VWNs provides the security and enhances the network performance. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using numerical results obtained from simulation.

AB Nowadays, in this digital world, one of the biggest concerns for business and many other public entities, is to know precisely the "identity" of the users that are behind of their systems. Since the data can define a person, there have been many tries to develop technology to determine accurately who the users are and certify their basics attributes like name, address, credit record, as well as other personal characteristics like health status, hobbies and others. That is why Digital Identity has taken a significantly important role in this area and becoming as a crucial security measure in this interconnected environment.
   This research is a systematic mapping review with the goal of collecting all relevant existing research of Digital Identity on Blockchain technology implemented in a smart city environment. The objective of this paper is to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions of these areas from the technical point of view. It is expected that this paper can stimulate interest in theory and practice to further discussions and research in these areas.

TI APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES IN SYSTEMATIZING THE RESULTS OF
   INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY
SO VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-JURIDICHESKIE NAUKI
AB Introduction: this article offers a comparative analysis of systematization of the results of intellectual activity in the Russian Federation and abroad. Systems for the registration of creative works in various countries, including Russia, function in different areas. There are registers in libraries and archives, as well as those maintained by organizations for the collective management of rights. In Europe, for example, a register of so-called orphan works (works whose authors are unknown) has been created. At the same time, the fact that a variety of such registers exist often makes commercialization of copyrighted objects quite difficult, especially if the turnover in rights to such objects takes place predominantly on the Internet. This article considers various registration systems for the results of creative work and identifies possibilities for the application of blockchain technologies to the systematization of such results. Purpose: to identify regulatory models for the systematization of the results of creative work in the digital sphere for the purpose of using blockchain technologies for the registration of rights to the results of intellectual activity. Methods: the methodological framework of the research is based on dialectical, formal, functional and other general research methods, as well as special methods used by legal scholars: comparative law research and technical research. Results: the authors have identified and described the existing Russian and foreign mechanisms utilized for the systematization of the results of creative work. Based on the comparative analysis offered herein, the possibilities of using blockchain technologies to systematize the results of intellectual activity have been demonstrated for the purpose of the subsequent creation of a single register of intellectual property. Conclusions: the analysis of systematization of the results of intellectual activity in accordance with Russian law and laws of some foreign countries enables us to conclude that the use of blockchain technologies for the purpose of systematizing the results of intellectual activity makes it possible to store, disseminate and transfer information about copyright objects and their rightsholders, their disposal systems, users, etc., and, thusly, can be used instead of the existing databases for intellectual property. The systematization of the results of intellectual activity on the basis of blockchain technologies answers the necessary technical requirements, safety requirements, requirements to decentralization, provides various access levels, and eliminates the need to have a third party to verify the transactions. The use of blockchain technologies would make registration and maintenance of registers by organizations for collective management of copyright and related rights and other organizations much less expensive, and would help to eliminate unnecessary intermediaries in this area.

AB It is predicted that cryptocurrencies will play an important role in the global economy. Therefore, it is prudent for us to understand the importance and monetary value of such cryptocurrencies, and strategize our investments accordingly. One of the ways to obtain cryptocurrency is via mining. As solo mining is not possible because of the computational requirements, pool mining has gained popularity.
   In this paper, we focus on Bitcoin and its pools. With more than 20 pools in the network of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it becomes challenging for a new miner to decide the pool he must join such that the profit is maximized. We use prospect theory to predict the profit that a specific miner, given his hash rate power and electricity costs, is expected to make from each pool. A utility value is calculated for each pool based on its recent performance, hash rate power, total number of the pool members, reward distribution policy of the pool, electricity fee in the new miner's region, pool fee, and the current Bitcoin value. Then, based on these parameters during a certain time duration, the most profitable pool is found for that miner. We show how the utility values from a pool varies with electricity fee and dollar equivalent of a Bitcoin. To find the accuracy of our predictions, we mine Bitcoin by joining 5 different pools- AntPool, F2Pool, BTC.com, SlushPool, and BatPool. Using an Antminer S5 for each pool, we mine Bitcoin for 40 consecutive days. Results reveal that our prospect theoretic predictions are consistent with what we actually mine; however predictions using expected utility theory are not as close.

AB The flow of information among people in today's world is essential. People need to exchange data, but they also need to store larger chunks of data for future retrieval. Various business schemes have grown by feeding themselves on these assumptions. Some of them provide the needed infrastructure, such as, cables or wireless base stations in case of GSM/LTE networks, while others provide complementary storage capabilities (cloud storage services). In this paper, we introduce a Fully Distributed GRIDNET protocol (FD-GRIDNET). It facilitates a solution to a problem of motivating users to intercede in a data exchange. MANET/DTN networks were envisioned as a target environment, however we do not restrain our protocol by design only to such. FD-GRIDNET is the first fully distributed data exchange protocol, which rewards intermediaries with a cryptocurrency, one created on behalf of the described communication system itself. It constitutes a communication system with a closed economy cycle, where acting as a router earns cryptocurrency, which in turn can be used for one's own needs, such as, but not limited to -data transmission. Indeed, FD-GRIDNET can be said to facilitate a cryptocurrency of its own. It builds upon a proof-of-work concept, but introduces elements of proof-of-stake as well.

AB As decentralized renewable energy has been installed into the present grid, millions of consumers and prosumers interacting each other over power grid. The variety of needs for exchanging energy would arise based on each customers' situation. The future electricity grid should be a bidirectional system with interconnected using distributed energy management software. Being able to provide a secure and decentralized control to these autonomous, peer-to-peer exchanges is one of the biggest challenges.
   We propose to use Blockchain-based electricity trading system with Digitalgrid router as an underlying platform because it could fit these requirements. Digitalgrid router, which consists back-to-back bi-directional digital inverters with software-based control, enables us to realize power exchange.

AB Bitcoin and hundreds of other cryptocurrencies employ a consensus protocol called Nakamoto consensus which rewards miners for maintaining a public blockchain. In this paper, we study the security of this protocol with respect to rational miners and show how a minority of the computation power can incentivize the rest of the network to accept a blockchain of the minority's choice. By deviating from the mining protocol, a mining pool which controls at least 38.2% of the network's total computational power can, with modest financial capacity, gain mining advantage over honest mining. Such an attack creates a longer valid blockchain by forking the honest blockchain, and the attacker's blockchain need not disrupt any "legitimate" non-mining transactions present on the honest blockchain. By subverting the consensus protocol, the attacking pool can double-spend money or simply create a blockchain that pays mining rewards to the attacker's pool. We show that our attacks are easy to encode in any Nakamoto-consensus-based cryptocurrency which supports a scripting language that is sufficiently expressive to encode its own mining puzzles.

AB Intellectual-property (IP) rights refer to the ownership of intellectual achievement. Microfilms are getting popular nowdue to their low production cost. However, their IP rights are often violated as microfilms can be copied and transmitted via mobile devices easily. This paper proposes using blockchain (BC) to develop an IP-protection model for microfilms. Information registered at a BC cannot be changed without being notified, and this provides an ideal setting for IP protection. This paper proposes a BC-based framework for microfilms in China.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bitcoin cryptocurrency is reportedly one widely used digital currency in criminal activities (e.g. used for online purchases of illicit drugs and paying of ransom in ransomware cases). However, there has been limited forensic research of bitcoin clients in the literature. In this paper, the process memory of two popular bitcoin clients, bitcoin Core and electrum, is examined with the aims of identifying potential sources and types of potential relevant data (e.g. bitcoin keys, transaction data and passphrases). Artefacts obtained from the process memory are also studied with other artefacts obtained from the client device (application files on disk and memory-mapped files and registry keys). Findings from this study suggest that both bitcoin Core and electrum's process memory is a valuable source of evidence, and many of the artefacts found in process memory are also available from the application and wallet files on the client device (disk).

AB In theory, database transactions protect application data from corruption and integrity violations. In practice, database transactions frequently execute under weak isolation that exposes programs to a range of concurrency anomalies, and programmers may fail to correctly employ transactions. While low transaction volumes mask many potential concurrency-related errors under normal operation, determined adversaries can exploit them programmatically for fun and profit. In this paper, we formalize a new kind of attack on database-backed applications called an ACIDRain attack, in which an adversary systematically exploits concurrency-related vulnerabilities via programmatically accessible APIs. These attacks are not theoretical: ACIDRain attacks have already occurred in a handful of applications in the wild, including one attack which bankrupted a popular Bitcoin exchange. To proactively detect the potential for ACIDRain attacks, we extend the theory of weak isolation to analyze latent potential for non-serializable behavior under concurrent web API calls. We introduce a language-agnostic method for detecting potential isolation anomalies in web applications, called Abstract Anomaly Detection (2AD), that uses dynamic traces of database accesses to efficiently reason about the space of possible concurrent interleavings. We apply a prototype 2AD analysis tool to 12 popular self-hosted eCommerce applications written in four languages and deployed on over 2M websites. We identify and verify 22 critical ACIDRain attacks that allow attackers to corrupt store inventory, over-spend gift cards, and steal inventory.

AB The purpose of this paper is to explore applications of blockchain technology related to demand side management of smart grid and to present an example that blockchain is used to facilitate machine-to-machine (M2M) interaction and frame an electricity market in the context of demand request. We use blockchain technology to record data derived from power flow calculation model and electricity price customization, and use smart contract to store transaction data and transfer assets automatically. Firstly, we establish a power flow calculation for microgrid operation system of 34 node master-slave control island, and the power flow is calculated and an optimal generator work adjustment is used. Then, according to the price customization, the participation mode of priced demand response is acquired. The presented scenario includes that a power management system and a generator which can actively adjust the power generation trading with each other over a blockchain. According to flow calculation and price customization, power management system generate smart contracts automatically. The final is that two sides complete the transaction and the load state of grid has been adjusted. This work contributes a proof-of-concept implementation of the scenario. This example verifies the feasibility of the method.

AB Blockchains show promise as potential infrastructure for financial transaction systems. The security of blockchains today, however, relies critically on Proof-of Work (PoW), which forces participants to waste computational resources.
   We present REM (Resource-Efficient Mining), a new blockchain mining framework that uses trusted hardware (Intel SGX). REM achieves security guarantees similar to PoW, but leverages the partially decentralized trust model inherent in SGX to achieve a fraction of the waste of PoW. Its key idea, Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW), involves miners providing trustworthy reporting on CPU cycles they devote to inherently useful workloads. REM flexibly allows any entity to create a useful workload. REM ensures the trustworthiness of these workloads by means of a novel scheme of hierarchical attestations that may be of independent interest.
   To address the risk of compromised SGX CPUs, we develop a statistics-based formal security framework, also relevant to other trusted-hardware-based approaches such as Intel's Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET). We show through economic analysis that REM achieves less waste than PoET and variant schemes.
   We implement REM and, as an example application, swap it into the consensus layer of Bitcoin core. The result is the first full implementation of an SGX-based blockchain We experiment with four example applications as useful workloads for our implementation of REM, and report a computational overhead of 5 - 15%.

AB The Bitcoin mining protocol has been intensively studied and widely adopted by many other cryptocurrencies. However, it has been shown that this protocol is not incentive compatible, because the selfish mining strategy enables a miner to gain unfair rewards. Existing defenses either demand fundamental changes to block validity rules or have little effect against a resourceful attacker. This paper proposes a backward-compatible defense mechanism which outperforms the previous best defense. Our fork-resolving policy neglects blocks that are not published in time and appreciates blocks that incorporate links to competing blocks of their predecessors. Consequently, a block that is kept secret until a competing block is published contributes to neither or both branches, hence it confers no advantage in winning the block race. Additionally, we discuss the dilemma between partition recovery time and selfish mining resistance, and how to balance them in our defense.

AB Untrusted Computing in cloud is the main obstacle to promote cloud computing services, even users get an initial trusted execution environment, the events of dynamic software deployment are easy to cause a risk of compromised system. TTP and ACS are the common strategies to reach an agreement of valid application list and operations, however, extra entity should be added into the origin network and the reliability of system rely on the trust operation of third party.
   Consider this network computing model, the directly remote controlled security strategy is lacking for terminal users, while the security of user computing applications are controlled by its resources owner like cloud manager which might be not trusted in whole time. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a consortium blockchain based cleanroom security service protocol (CSSP), to track the deployment and usage of the user's software in a secure and tamper-resistant measure, to prevent running of error or illegal software in user computing environment. Unlike the traditional methods, CSSP is a two side protocol: service provider and user computing node, which reduce the redundant safety hazards nodes and its invalidation problem. Consortium Blockchain is an effectively method to reduce the energy consumption and keep the software service protocol between the manager and the user in safety state. The security analysis and evaluation shows that the approach has major potential in trusted network computing system and provide a higher secure level environment for users.

Volunteer service time and activity information recorded by sending the chain transaction. Effective time recognition is guaranteed by smart contract. It can ensure that the volunteer's time is independent of improper human interference, and the fairness of volunteer service, realizes the traceability and transparency of the entire time record process. Then we describe a specific case and use the system we proposed storing the volunteer service time, volunteers' service time can be certified effectively.

SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB Background: Bitcoin system, when more than 51% computing power is controlled by a single node, the block chain can be distorted maliciously. This is called 51% attack which is a well-known potential risk that could destroy the Bitcoin system.
   Method: The paper proves that under the current proof-of-work mechanism, computing power eventually will be centralized at a single node if miners are rational enough.
   Result: The paper propose a new proof-of-work mechanism that improves decentralization and reduces the risk of 51% attack without increasing the risk of Sybil attack.
   Concusions: This new mechanism introduces a series of principles such as Career open to all talents, without distinction of birth, Distribution according to labor and All Men are created equal.

TI Group bargaining based bitcoin mining scheme using incentive payment
   process
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency that has generated considerable public interests through a fully decentralised network with an inherently independence from governments or any central authorities. Although its short history has been volatile, the Bitcoin maintains a core group of committed users. In this study, we look at the Bitcoin complex structure and design a new Bitcoin mining protocol while developing a novel incentive payment process. To effectively implement an incentive payment mechanism, we adopt the concept of the group bargaining solution by considering a peer-to-peer relationship, and it is practically applied to a distributed computation network system. Based on the cooperative game model, we explore an efficient solution that can maximise Bitcoin users' rewards. Through system level simulations, the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with other existing schemes. The simulation results show that our group bargaining game approach outperforms the existing Bitcoin schemes in providing a better fair-efficient system performance.

TI Comparing Dimensional Models Assessing Personality Traits and
   Personality Pathology Among Adult ADHD and Borderline Personality
   Disorder
SO JOURNAL OF ATTENTION DISORDERS
AB Objective: This pilot study was a comparison of dimensional models assessing personality traits and personality pathology in a clinical sample of adults diagnosed with ADHD and adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), and a nonclinical control sample of healthy adults. Method: Personality traits were assessed using the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R) and dimensional personality pathology with the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). Results: Adults with ADHD and BPD produced higher Emotional Dysregulation/Neuroticism and Dissocial Behavior scores than controls. For the Extraversion/Inhibitedness scale, adults with BPD produced significantly lower scores than adults with ADHD and controls. On the Conscientiousness/Compulsivity domains, Conscientiousness scores were lower for both disorders, whereas low Compulsivity values were specific to adult ADHD. Conclusion: Our results suggest that patients with adult ADHD and BPD have distinguishable profiles of personality traits and personality pathology.

AB In spite of the virtual nature and the system operating purely based on pre-formulated computer algorithms, cryptocurrency networks have reached greater popularity with a significant follower base with people placing trust on the system operation. As credibility is an important factor for systems facilitating financial transactions, in this study we will be presenting a simple model facilitating identification of relevant important factors to be considered by users and a methodology for assessing the credibility of cryptocurrency networks. We identify two routes, systems and the psychological perspective in the credibility assessment process which varies with the user expertise.

AB Decentralized cryptocurrency systems offer a medium of exchange secured by cryptography, without the need of a centralized banking authority. Among others, Bitcoin is considered as the most mature one. Its popularity lies on the introduction of the concept of the blockchain, a public distributed ledger shared by all participants of the system. Double spending attacks and blockchain forks are two main issues in blockchain-based protocols. The first one refers to the ability of an adversary to use the very same bitcoin more than once, while blockchain forks cause transient inconsistencies in the blockchain. We show through probabilistic analysis that the reliability of recent solutions that exclusively rely on a particular type of Bitcoin actors, called miners, to guarantee the consistency of Bitcoin operations, drastically decreases with the size of the blockchain.

AB In this paper we provide a short quantitative analysis of Bitcoin Block Withholding (BWH) Attack. In this study, we investigate the incentive earned by a miner who either independently or at the diktat of a separate mining pool launches Block Withholding attack on a target mining pool. The victim pool shares its earned revenue with the rogue attacker. We investigate the property revenue function of the attacker and find parameters that could maximize the gain of the attacker. We then propose a new concept that we call "special reward". This special rewarding scheme is aimed at discouraging the attackers by granting additional incentive to a miner who actually finds a block. A BWH attacker who never submits a valid block to the pool will be deprived from this special reward and her gain will be less than her expectation. Depending upon the actual monetary value of the special reward a pool can significantly reduce the revenue of a BWH attacker and thus can even ward off the threat of an attack.

AB We present (DNS)-N-3, a system to replace the current top level DNS system and certificate authorities, offering increased scalability, security and robustness.
   (DNS)-N-3 is based on a distributed hash table and utilizes a domain name ownership system based on the Bitcoin blockchain. It addresses previous criticism that a DHT would not suffice as a DNS replacement.
   (DNS)-N-3 provides solutions to current DNS vulnerabilities such as DDOS attacks, DNS spoofing and censorship by local governments. (DNS)-N-3 eliminates the need for certificate authorities by providing a decentralized authenticated record of domain name ownership. Unlike previous DNS replacement proposals, (DNS)-N-3 is reverse compatible with DNS and allows for incremental implementation within the current system.

AB In this work we present Picasso: a lightweight device class fingerprinting protocol that allows a server to verify the software and hardware stack of a mobile or desktop client. As an example, Picasso can distinguish between traffic sent by an authentic iPhone running Safari on iOS from an emulator or desktop client spoofing the same configuration. Our fingerprinting scheme builds on unpredictable yet stable noise introduced by a client's browser, operating system, and graphical stack when rendering HTML5 canvases. Our algorithm is resistant to replay and includes a hardware-bound proof of work that forces a client to expend a configurable amount of CPU and memory to solve challenges. We demonstrate that Picasso can distinguish 52 million Android, iOS, Windows, and OSX clients running a diversity of browsers with 100% accuracy. We discuss applications of Picasso in abuse fighting, including protecting the Play Store or other mobile app marketplaces from inorganic interactions; or identifying login attempts to user accounts from previously unseen device classes.

AB The popularity of digital currencies, especially cryptocurrencies, has been continuously growing since the appearance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency protocol enabling transactions between individuals without the need of a trusted authority. Its network is formed from resources contributed by individuals known as miners. Users of Bitcoin currency create transactions that are stored in a specialised data structure called a block chain. Bitcoin's security lies in a proof-of-work scheme, which requires high computational resources at the miners. These miners have to be synchronised with any update in the network, which produces high data traffic rates. Despite advances in mobile technology, no cryptocurrencies have been proposed for mobile devices. This is largely due to the lower processing capabilities of mobile devices when compared with conventional computers and the poorer Internet connectivity to that of the wired networking. In this work, we propose LocalCoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that requires minimal computational resources, produces low data traffic and works with off-the-shelf mobile devices. LocalCoin replaces the computational hardness that is at the root of Bitcoin's security with the social hardness of ensuring that all witnesses to a transaction are colluders. It is based on opportunistic networking rather than relying on infrastructure and incorporates characteristics of mobile networks such as users' locations and their coverage radius in order to employ an alternative proof-of-work scheme. Localcoin features (i) a lightweight proof-of-work scheme and (ii) a distributed block chain.

AB Since 2009, the Bitcoin open-source software project has established a commanding presence in the digital currency space as a self-organizing, distributed system. The project stems from a long history of efforts to harness decentralization and progressive cryptography for social good, as espoused by the ethos of the Cypherpunks mailing list on which Bitcoin was first released. However, certain design choices in Bitcoin's core protocol have led to consolidation of the peer-to-peer nodes, rather than greater diversification, thus threatening system integrity. In this position paper, we explore the socio-technical limits that challenge Bitcoin's ability to remain fully decentralized and "self-contained" as an algorithmically governed system. The need to integrate into existing human systems and infrastructures complicates the project's original vision. We propose hardware, software and electricity management modifications to the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, recognizing the need for socio-inspired design strategies to revive network integrity. We then use Bitcoin as an example to discuss the fundamental limitations of "pure decentralization" and algorithmic self-governance.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Lots of existing work addresses the analysis of Bitcoin's publicly available transaction graph. There are evaluations of the user's anonymity and privacy, but no proper measurements of the underlying network. This paper presents novel insights about Bitcoin's P2P network, with a focus on the distribution among autonomous systems. The resilience of Bitcoin's ecosystem, the unambiguousness of the blockchain, the propagation and verification of transaction blocks, but also the anonymity of Bitcoin's users depend on the structure of the global network. Our work is the first thorough analysis of Bitcoin's underlying network, especially with regard to its distribution at autonomous system level. We traversed Bitcoin's network and made statements about the size of the accessible network and the number of clients. Further, we investigated the network's distribution on autonomous systems. Finally, we analysed the mechanism to announce known peers. It turns out that Bitcoin's peer announcement is not well-distributed, affecting information propagation.

This new type of currency was created to ease online transactions and to provide greater convenience in making payments. However, a critical component of a monetary system is the people who use it. Acknowledging this, we present results of our interview study (N=20) with two groups of participants (users and non-users) about how they perceive the most popular digital currency, Bitcoin. Our results reveal: non-users mistakenly believe they are incapable of using Bit coin, users are not well-versed in how the protocol functions, they have misconceptions about the privacy of transactions, and that Bitcoin satisfies properties of ideal payment systems as defined by our participants. Our results illustrate Bitcoin's tradeoffs, its uses, and barriers to entry.

The current system is primarily a paper-based system more suited to the 19th than the 21st century. While the states have implemented varying degrees of computerization and modernization, dealing with fifty separate registration databases has made it difficult for banks and their attorneys to automate their processes, leading to errors and loss. The system could be modernized by storing the records for all 50 states in a single shared database with external electronic access. In this paper, we propose an implementation of a distributed, replicated database utilizing a variation on the Bitcoin blockchain for data storage and validation.

SO BANKING BEYOND BANKS AND MONEY: A GUIDE TO BANKING SERVICES IN THE
   TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
SE New Economic Windows
AB Bitcoin has ushered in the age of blockchain-based digital currency systems. Secured by cryptography and computing power, and distributed across a decentralized network of anonymous nodes, these novel systems could potentially disrupt the way that monetary policy is administered-moving away from today's human-fallible central bankers and towards a technocratic, rules-based algorithmic approach. It can be argued that modern central banks have failed to stem macroeconomic crises, and may have, in fact, exacerbated negative outcomes by incentivizing excessive risk-taking and moral hazard via unconventional monetary tools such as quantitative easing and negative interest rates. A central bank typically serves three primary functions: to issue and regulate the supply of money; to serve as clearinghouse for settlement of payments transactions; and to serve as lender of last resort. Could a digital currency system serve as a rational substitute for a central bank? This perspective paper examines that question, and then suggests that indeed it could be plausible. While Bitcoin in its current form will prove to be inadequate to function as monetary authority, I put forward what an operative case could resemble.

AB Studies of legitimacy have typically looked at the creation and maintenance of legitimacy by both established and new organisations. This paper looks at how a set of entrepreneurs use the legitimacy of one, Alternative, community as a scaffold to build legitimacy in a more Mainstream one, despite the fact that norms between the two were often contradictory. Studying Bitcoin entrepreneurs in Europe, we find that the distributed, digital community of Bitcoin operates as a kind of MNC: the larger decentralised (and Alternative) community acts as the headquarters, while the local entrepreneurs seeking Mainstream legitimacy behave like subsidiaries. This allow them to rely on the legitimacy of the community at large, while simultaneously distinguishing themselves from the broader Bitcoin community as they seek legitimacy.

AB The case of the Somali shilling defies the historical view that sovereign powers (i.e., legal tender status, public receivability) are necessary to explain the acceptance of fiat money at a positive value. Following the Somali state's collapse in 1991, irredeemable paper shillings have continued to circulate at a positive value. Acceptance under statelessness is explained by a history that made continued acceptance a focal point among self-fulfilling strategies. Our explanation is consistent with an extended Kiyotaki-Wright model of fiat money. Although sovereign power may be necessary to launch a fiat money in practice, we maintain that it is not necessary for its survival.

The policy was vital in reducing duplication of effort and economic waste. As a result, we felt obligated to publish the Cannabis genome data in a similar spirit and placed them immediately on a cloud based Amazon server in August of 2011. While these rapid data release practices were heralded by many in the media, we still find some authors fail to find or reference said work and hope to compel the readership that this omission has more pervasive repercussions than bruised egos and is a regression for our community.

AB The volume and frequency of new cyber attacks have exploded in recent years. Such events have very complicated workflows and involve multiple criminal actors and organizations. However, current practices for threat analysis and intelligence discovery are still performed piecemeal in an ad-hoc manner. For example, a modern malware analysis system can dissect a piece of malicious code by itself. But, it cannot automatically identify the criminals who developed it or relate other cyber attack events with it. Consequently, it is imperative to automatically assemble the jigsaw puzzles of cybercrime events by performing threat intelligence fusion on data collected from heterogeneous sources, such as malware, underground social networks, cryptocurrency transaction records, etc. In this paper, we propose an Automated Threat Intelligence fuSion framework (ATIS) that is able to take all sorts of threat sources into account and discover new intelligence by connecting the dots of apparently isolated cyber events. To this end, ATIS consists of 5 planes, namely analysis, collection, controller, data and application planes. We discuss the design choices we made in the function of each plane and the interfaces between two adjacent planes. In addition, we develop two applications on top of ATIS to demonstrate its effectiveness.

TI Pectobacterium aroidearum and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp
   carotovorum as causal agents of potato soft rot in Lebanon
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB To identify bacteria causing severe soft rot on potato in Lebanon, pectinolytic bacteria were isolated from diseased samples collected in the Bekaa valley and the Akkar region, during 2009-2010. Six isolates that induced a hypersensitive reaction in tobacco plants and caused a marked soft rot when inoculated in potato tubers or stem, DAPP-PG 752 to DAPP-PG 757, were further characterized. Analysis of 16S-23S intergenic transcribed spacer-regions, digested with RsaI and CfoI, demonstrated that isolates DAPP-PG 753 to DAPP-PG 757 showed electrophoretic profiles similar to that of LMG 2408, a strain misclassified as Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, and different from that of DAPP-PG 752. Phylogenetic analysis using partial malate dehydrogenase gene sequences, clustered DAPP-PG 752 in a clade that contained the type strain of P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, while DAPP-PG 753 to DAPP-PG 757, together with LMG 2408, fell in a clade including strains of the recently described species Pectobacterium aroidearum. Multilocus sequence analysis of concatenated partial sequences of the atpD, gyrB, infB and rpoB genes confirmed the results obtained with the mdh gene sequences and identified DAPP-PG 752 as P. carotovorum, and LMG 2408 and the five related Lebanese isolates as P. aroidearum. The Lebanese P. aroidearum isolates were phenotypically similar to known P. aroidearum strains, based on API 50 CHE data. They showed identical BOX- and ERIC-PCR profiles that resembled profiles of known P. aroidearum strains. This study represents the first official report of P. aroidearum as causal agent of soft rot on potato plants and the first occurrence of P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum on potato plants in Lebanon.

AB The impact of medication adherence is proven to affect hospitalization risk and healthcare cost. In Malaysia, failure in taking medication as prescribed is a complicated and common problem. There are many reasons people fail to take their medication as prescribed. Some of the few common issues are remembering to consume their medicine timely, doubts in medication effectiveness, concerns on side effects or having difficulty in taking the medication (especially with injections or inhalers) and rising cost of prescribed medications. Tracking patient medication intake leads to many advantages, one of which is lower medication due to adherence, health-care cost which effects insurance coverage premiums. In this paper, we develop an application to track medication using a smart phone and the use of QR code. Each medication transaction requires a proof of work to signify that the user have taken their medication at the correct date and time. A QR-Code reader will be used to capture medication taken printed on medication labels and each scan is considered as a proof of work. Our contribution is to create a mobile application that can help track medication intake, as well as remind, inform and warn users about the medication that they are taking.

AB Cryptographic accumulators are a tool for compact set representation and secure set membership proofs. When an element is added to a set by means of an accumulator, a membership witness is generated. This witness can later be used to prove the membership of the element. Typically, the membership witness has to be synchronized with the accumulator value: it has to be updated every time another element is added to the accumulator, and it cannot be used with outdated accumulator values. However, in many distributed applications (such as blockchain-based public key infrastructures), requiring strict synchronization is prohibitive. We define low update frequency, which means that a witness only needs to be updated a small number of times, and old-accumulator compatibility, which means that a witness can be used with outdated accumulator values. Finally, we propose an accumulator that achieves both of those properties.

AB Data sharing presents extensive opportunities and challenges in domains such as the public sector, health care and financial services. This paper introduces the concept of "trusted data marketplaces" as a mechanism for enabling trusted sharing of data. It takes credit scoring an essential mechanism of the entire world-economic environment, determining access for companies and individuals to credit and the terms under which credit is provisioned as an example for the realization of the trusted data marketplaces concept. This paper looks at credit scoring from a data perspective, analyzing current shortcomings in the use and sharing of data for credit scoring, and outlining a conceptual framework in terms of a trusted data marketplace to overcome the identified shortcomings. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: (1) identify and discuss the core data issues that hinder innovation in credit scoring; (2) propose a conceptual architecture for trusted data marketplaces for credit scoring in order to serve as a reference architecture for the implementation of future credit scoring systems. The architecture is generic and can be adopted in other domains where data sharing is of high relevance.

AB Future wars will be cyber wars and the attacks will be a sturdy amalgamation of cryptography along with malware to distort information systems and its security. The explosive Internet growth facilitates cyber-attacks. Web threats include risks, that of loss of confidential data and erosion of consumer confidence in e-commerce. The emergence of cyber hack jacking threat in the new form in cyberspace is known as ransomware or crypto virus. The locker bot waits for specific triggering events, to become active. It blocks the task manager, command prompt and other cardinal executable files, a thread checks for their existence every few milliseconds, killing them if present. Imposing serious threats to the digital generation, ransomware pawns the Internet users by hijacking their system and encrypting entire system utility files and folders, and then demanding ransom in exchange for the decryption key it provides for release of the encrypted resources to its original form. We present in this research, the anatomical study of a ransomware family that recently picked up quite a rage and is called CTB locker, and go on to the hard money it makes per user, and its source C& C server, which lies with the Internet's greatest incognito mode- The Dark Net. Cryptolocker Ransomware or the CTB Locker makes a Bitcoin wallet per victim and payment mode is in the form of digital bitcoins which utilizes the anonymity network or Tor gateway. CTB Locker is the deadliest malware the world ever encountered.

TI Using Network Traffic to Infer Hardware State: A Kernel-Level
   Investigation
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS
AB In this article, we illustrate that the boundary of a general-purpose node can be extended into the network by extracting information from network traffic generated by that general-purpose node to infer the state of its hardware components. This information is represented in a delay signature latent within the network traffic. In contrast, the traditional approach to determine the internal state of a node's resources meant that a software application with internal processes had to be resident on the node. The aforementioned delay signature is the keystone that provides a correlation between network traffic and the internal state of the source node. We characterize this delay signature by (1) identifying the different types of assembly language instructions that source this delay and (2) describing how architectural techniques, such as instruction pipelining and caching, give rise to this delay signature. In theory, highly utilized nodes (due to multiple threads) will contain excessive context switching and contention for shared resources. One important shared resource is main memory, and excessive use of this resource by applications and internal processes eventually leads to a decrease in cache efficiency that eventually stalls the instruction pipeline. Our results support this theory; specifically, we have observed that excessive context switching in active applications increases the effective memory access time and wastes precious CPU cycles, thus adding additional delay to the execution of load, store, and other instructions. Because the operating system (OS) kernel accesses memory to send network packets, the delay signature is induced into network traffic in situations where user-level utilization is high. We demonstrate this theory in two case studies: (1) resource discovery in cluster grids and (2) network-based detection of bitcoin mining on compromised nodes.

TI Formulation and Evaluation of Liposomes for Transdermal Delivery of
   Celecoxib
SO JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF NATURAL PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS
AB Background: Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor recommended orally to treat arthritis and osteoarthritis. It is a highly lipophilic, poorly soluble drug with oral bioavailability of around 40%. Long term oral administration of celecoxib causes serious gastrointestinal side effects.
   Objectives: The current study aimed to assess the skin permeation of celecoxib by a transdermally applied liposomal formulation.
   Materials and Methods: Liposomes were prepared by thin film method using soya lecithin and cholesterol. Physicochemical characteristics of the liposomes such as, particle size, drug encapsulation efficiency were determined. Also, drug release and in vitro skin permeability through rat skin were evaluated using Franz diffusion cells.
   Results: The results showed that the maximum drug encapsulation efficiency was 43.24%. Drug release profile showed that 81.25% of the drugs released in the first 24 hours of the experiment. Fluxes (Jss), permeability coefficient (P),diffusivity coefficient (D) parameters of the optimum liposomal formulation were significantly higher than those of saturated aqueous solution of celecoxib. The decrease of lecithin increased values. Particle sizes of the formulations ranged from 0.117 to 1.123 pm. Jss, Dapp and P parameters in L -8 formulations were 29.18, 60.95, and 3.21 times higher than those of saturated water solution of celecoxib, respectively The results of vesicles characterization indicated the potential application of celecoxib loaded liposome as carrier system.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the components such as lecithin and cholesterol, and vortex time in liposomal formulations have an essential role in the physicochemical properties and celecoxib permeability through rat skin.

TI Lithium Diffusion in Cation-Mixing-Free LiMn1-xFexPO4 Synthesized by
   Hydrothermal Process
SO JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB Lithium diffusion properties of LiMn1-xFexPO4 synthesized by hydrothermal methods were characterized from electrochemical and structural analysis. Structural defects such as cation mixing in LiMn1-xFexPO4 impede the lithium-ion diffusion. Therefore, it is important to understand effects of cation mixing in LiMn1-xFexPO4 on lithium diffusivity of LiMn1-xFexPO4. The amount of cation mixing of lithium and Mn/Fe in LiMn1-xFexPO4 was obtained by means of neutron diffraction measurements. Rietveld refinements indicated that cation mixing in the prepared LiMn1-xFexPO4 was negligible. Apparent chemical diffusion coefficients (D-app) of lithium of LiMn1-xFexPO4 dependent on the Mn/Fe ratio were obtained by potential-step chronoamperometry (PSCA) measurements of thin composite electrodes. D-app of lithium insertion or extraction reaction of LiMn1-xFexPO4 for Mn2+/Mn3+ increased with Fe content. D-app for Fe2+/Fe3+ slightly increased with decreasing Fe content. The difference of Dapp value was attributed to the activation energies (E-a) of lithium diffusion process of LiMn1-xFexPO4. The E-a of LiMn1-xFexPO4 for Mn2+/Mn3+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ was determined by the energy barrier of lithium hopping at the interphase between Li-rich and Li-poor phase under electrochemical kinetic conditions.

AB Blockchain, an innovative public ledger of transactions that underpins digital currencies such as Bitcoin, has the potential to open up and offer radical alternatives to civic life, democracy and society. Yet there is currently only a small, technically savvy section of society who understand its principles. Therefore in order to work through and realize the potential of the blockchain and its transferability across society we need to find means to open up and reduce its 'ineffable' nature. This paper presents and reflects on an approach that made the complexity of the blockchain understandable or 'effable' using physical modeling. The design-based approach adopted a tangible system of Lego and colored stickers to allow participant-actors to physically enact transactions on a Blockchain Lego 'block'. This modeled simplification was not designed as a comprehensive or accurate explanation of Bitcoin and Blockchain but rather as a prompt for opening up rich dialogue and insightful lines of questioning.

AB We introduce the first graph-theoretic proof-of-work system, based on finding small cycles or other structures in large random graphs. Such problems are trivially verifiable and arbitrarily scalable, presumably requiring memory linear in graph size to solve efficiently. Our cycle finding algorithm uses one bit per edge, and up to one bit per node. Run-time is linear in graph size and dominated by random access latency, ideal properties for a memory bound proof-of-work. We exhibit two alternative algorithms that allow for a memory-time trade-off (TMTO)-decreased memory usage, by a factor k, coupled with increased runtime, by a factor Omega(k). The constant implied in Omega() gives a notion of memory-hardness, which is shown to be dependent on cycle length, guiding the latter's choice. Our algorithms are shown to parallelize reasonably well.

In this paper, we analyze a comprehensive Bitcoin transaction dataset and investigate the interrelationship between the flow of Bitcoin transactions and its price movement. Using network theory, we examine a few complexity measures of the Bitcoin transaction flow networks, and we model the joint dynamic relationship between these complexity measures and Bitcoin market variables such as return and volatility. We find that a particular complexity measure of the Bitcoin transaction network flow is significantly correlated with the Bitcoin market return and volatility. More specifically we document that the residual diversity or freedom of Bitcoin network flow scaled by the total system throughput can significantly improve the predictability of Bitcoin market return and volatility.

TI Glucose-responsive Hydrogels Based on ABA Triblock Copolymers Containing
   Phenylboronic Acid
SO ACTA POLYMERICA SINICA
AB A new type of poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) chain transfer reagent was synthesized and used to mediate the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of 3-(acrylamino) phenylboronic acid (AAPBA) to get three types of PAAPBA-b-PEO-b-PAABPA triblock copolymers with different PAAPBA lengths. The gelation of these copolymers at physiological pH was examined. It was found that hydrogel formation was dependent on the PAABPA block chain length when the block was too long, no stable gel can be obtained due to the high hydrophobicity of the PAABPA segment. The effects of temperature, polymer concentration and glucose on the rheological properties of the gel were investigated in detail. The results indicated that the formed hydrogels possess solid-like behavior, at high polymer concentrations, gels with high strength and high phase transfer temperature could be obtained. In the presence of high concentration of glucose, interaction of glucose with the PAAPBA block can lead to the increase of the hydrophilicity of the PAAPBA block, thus leading to the break of the hydrogel network with time and finally the gel dissolved in about 1.5 h. Finally, the hydrogels could load FITC-BSA in the hydrophilic regions, and the release profile of FITC-BSA was accelerated in the presence of glucose.

AB This paper aims to address two challenging questions: "What are the bases on which online users choose to use and/or mine their cryptocurrency?" and "Which factors strongly affect the coin's popularity and value?" We try to answer these two questions for eight chosen cryptocurrencies by conducting an online survey. Results obtained from the online survey indicate that more than half of the participants believe that the currency name and logo affect the choice of using and/or mining a cryptocurrency. Moreover, the majority of the participants stated the ease of mining, having strong, fun and large community along with anonymity, privacy, and the currency's value, popularity, potential and technology as advantages of the currencies they choose to use and/or mine. These results help in observing the people behavior and predicting how successful and promising a cryptocurrency might become in the future.

AB The use of Bitcoins is increasing rapidly. Bitcoins are utilized in e-commerce to purchase both legal and illegal goods, they are transferred and traded and companies have invested their capital in the new digital currency. While the technical aspects of the system are well established, the legal framework remains unclear. Legislators all over the world are just starting to discover this new virtual phenomenon. This article illustrates selected legal challenges arising in different fields of law (public, criminal and civil law). Particular attention is paid to the German situation while the US-American context is also considered.

AB The market development of cryptocurrencies illustrates an institutional change how payments can be released and received without the need of any intermediary or trusted central party to clear virtual transactions. As academia focuses mostly on Bitcoin, the increased money demand within cryptocurrencies, its linkages, the wide range of possible channels to release and receive executed payments (payment patterns) and the wide range of different underlying motivations why cryptocurrencies are demanded to release payments (payment behavior) is still uncovered. One might assume that payment patterns and payment behavior converges in the future as soon as the experimenting phase would have cooled down. However we observe that Bitcoin shows a strong, Litecoin a weak and Namecoin no weekday seasonality. By analyzing observed number of payments directly (between these cryptocurrencies) and indirectly (via the Bitcoin exchange-rate) we find no relationship. We conclude on these findings that payment patterns and payment behaviors on the basis of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Litecoin and Namecoin continue to diverge.

AB Botnets are organized networks of infected computers that are used for malicious purposes. An example is Kelihos.B, a botnet of the Kelihos family used primarily for mining bitcoins, sending spam and stealing bitcoin wallets. A large part of the Kelihos. B botnet was sinkholed in early 2012 and since then bots are sending requests to controlled servers. In this paper, we analyze and characterize the behavior of Kelihos. B. Our analysis is based on the log file of the bot request logged at the sinkhole from March 2012 to early November 2013. We investigate both the overall characteristics of the botnets, as well as on its evolution over time since the time of the sinkholing. Our results indicate that, although this trend is decreasing, there are possibly still newly infected bots even more than a year from the original sinkholing.

AB Due to the strength of bitcoin including the convenient payment and transfer, exchange into legal tender, low transfer fee, and others, its usage is increasing dramatically. Bitcoin is an e-money and virtual currency currently used as a means of payment in about 20,000 online companies and 1,000 offline stores as of Feb. 2014. Different from previous e-money, there is no issuing institution and it has trait of no regulation by countries or companies. However, as there is an increase in value of bitcoin followed by Cyprus financial crisis in past March, issues regarding the security breach on the rise. Since the exchange between legal tender and virtual currency is free in case of bitcoin, direct damage caused by security breach is very large. Also, as there is no governing institution, the user is responsible for all loss in case of damage occurrence. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to look into transaction method and security breach trend of bitcoin and its countermeasures.

AB This research applies theories of trust from e-commerce to digital currencies. In particular trust in business to consumer transactions carried out using digital currencies such as Bitcoin is explored. A model of online trust is considered to be valid in this different transaction context but the significance of each construct changes and some extensions are necessary. In particular the role of institutional trust in transactions has differences that are explored and new constructs are suggested. These are incorporated into a new digital currency enabled transactions trust model.

TI Musicians Seeking Psychiatric Help; A Preliminary Study of Psychiatric
   Characteristics
SO MEDICAL PROBLEMS OF PERFORMING ARTISTS
AB Musicians are at increased risk for mental disorders, in particular performance anxiety. Likely causes are high levels of occupational stress, special personality traits, and coping skills. In this cross-sectional study, routine outcome monitoring (ROM) data on clinical and psychosocial characteristics were collected from the first 50 musicians visiting our outpatient psychiatric clinic for performing artists and were compared to those of a large sample of psychiatric outpatients (n=1,498) and subjects from the general population. Of the musician outpatients, 82% (n=41) met the criteria of an Axis I psychiatric disorder. Performance anxiety could not be accurately diagnosed with the MINI-plus, and in a few cases it masked different psychiatric disorders. Musician outpatients scored significantly better on functional scales despite their Axis I disorder, with equal scores on scales measuring distress compared to general outpatients. Musicians displayed significantly higher mean scores on the DAPP-sf subscale measuring narcissistic personality traits than general outpatients and non-patient controls (p=0.001). Diagnostic challenges, in particular regarding performance anxiety, of musicians seeking psychiatric care are thoroughly discussed. Musicians with psychiatric disorders may constitute a group of patients with specific characteristics who may benefit from specialized psychiatric care, and health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence of psychiatric disorders in musicians.

AB In this paper, we study Bitcoin network for electronic cash transactions, and compare the extension to the BTCs network which inculcates provision of executing fast transactions with greater security and assurance with the former method of Proof-Of-Work for executing transactions. Above milestones are achieved by introducing the concepts of mutual trust and verifiable code execution between the payer and the payee in the network. Our work proposes a significant modification of the Pioneer model to provide a two-party trust framework for Bitcoin transactions; considerably faster compared to the generic trust platform of Bitcoin networks based on slow proof-of-work. The scheme proposed can promote the use of Bitcoin transactions in real life scenarios, where fast transactions are desirable due time constraints between the payment and the service.

TI An empirical investigation of volatility dynamics in the cryptocurrency
   market
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB By employing an asymmetric Diagonal BEKK model, this paper examines volatility dynamics of five major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, Litecoin, and Stellar Lumen. It is shown that the conditional variances of all the five cryptocurrencies are significantly affected by both previous squared errors and past conditional volatility. Moreover, in the case of Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, and Litecoin, asymmetric past shocks have a significant effect in the current conditional variance. Similar results are obtained for the cryptocurrencies' conditional covariances, which are significantly affected by cross products of previous error terms and past covariance terms while capturing asymmetric effects of past shocks accordingly. It is also shown that time-varying conditional correlations exist and are mostly positive. Finally, the cryptocurrencies' volatility dynamics are found to be responsive to major news, with Bitcoin and Litecoin exhibiting one structural breakpoint each in the conditional variance. The results improve our understanding of interdependencies between cryptocurrencies as well as of the events that affect their volatility dynamics and thus have important implications for both cryptocurrency users and investors.

TI SMER: a secure method of exchanging resources in heterogeneous internet
   of things
SO FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The number of IoT (Internet of things) connected devices increases rapidly. These devices have different operation systems and therefore cannot communicate with each other. As a result, the data they collected is limited within their own platform. Besides, IoT devices have very constrained resources like weak MCU (micro control unit) and limited storage. Therefore, they need direct communication method to cooperate with each other, or with the help of nearby devices with rich resources. In this paper, we propose a secure method to exchange resources (SMER) between heterogeneous IoT devices. In order to exchange resources among devices, SMER adopts a compensable mechanism for resource exchange and a series of security mechanisms to ensure the security of resource exchanges. Besides, SMER uses a smart contract based scheme to supervise resource exchange, which guarantees the safety and benefits of IoT devices. We also introduce a prototype system and make a comprehensive discussion.

AB In a data sharing group, each user can upload, modify, and access group files and a user is required to generate a new signature for the modified file after modification. There is a situation that two or more users modify the same file at almost the same time, which should be avoided as it gives rise to a signature conflict. However, the existing schemes do not take it into consideration. In this paper, we proposed a new mechanism SeShare for data storing based on blockchain to realize signature uniqueness, which solves the problem of generating signatures for the same file meanwhile by different group users. Specifically, we record every signature of a file in a blockchain in chronological order, and only one user is allowed to add new signature at the end of the blockchain when modification conflicts occur. On the other hand, to provide a secure data sharing service, SeShare introduces an efficient public auditing scheme for file integrity verification when a group user leaves the group. We also prove the security of the proposed scheme and evaluate the performance at the end of this paper. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of public auditing for user leaving.

AB In this study, we first investigate the impacts of leverage effect and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on one-step-ahead Bitcoin volatility using high-frequency data. We find that the leverage effect can impacts on future volatility significantly. However, the jumps and EPU seem not to impact future volatility during in-sample period. The MCS test results show that the leverage effect is more powerful than jump components in forecasting Bitcoin volatility. Moreover, using the common information of the leverage effect and EPU can improve the models' predictive ability. Finally, our robust tests are supported to these conclusions. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Makerchain: A blockchain with chemical signature for self-organizing
   process in social manufacturing
SO JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
AB The growth of personalized demands requires socialized resources to timely self-organize themselves with crowd intelligence for co-creating open architecture products. This social manufacturing paradigm drives an increased demand for makers to track the authenticity and quality of products. A new decentralized blockchain-driven model, named Makerchain, is presented to handle the cyber-credit of social manufacturing among various makers. An anti-counterfeiting method composed of chemical signature is proposed to represent unique features of personalized products. Twinning unique signature data to blockchain and other functional databases is realized and anticipated to make manufacturing service transactions among makers more trustworthy. Based on an automated execution mechanism of smart contracts among makers, a decentralized manufacturing network can be enabled for automating transactions among makers, as well as third-party verification of product lifecycle through a trail of historic events. A Makerchain Decentralized Application (DApp) is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach through which clustered makers can self-organizing themselves around personalized demands.

   Fractional Grey Lotka-Volterra dynamical system
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Fractional Grey Lotka-Volterra Model with variable order is introduced and used for modeling the transaction counts of three cryptocurrencies namely Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Bitcoin and Litecoin then both three cryptocurrencies transaction counts are modeled in 2 and 3-dimensional framework respectively. Dataset include transaction counts of cryptocurrencies of interest. The 2-dimensional model uses Bitcoin and Litecoin transactions from April, 28, 2013 to February, 10, 2018. The 3-dimensional model uses transactions from August, 7, 2013 to February, 10, 2018. The actual values and the model values of n-dimensional model n = {2, 3} are displayed. The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) suggests a high accuracy of the 3-dimensional Variable-order Fractional Lotka-Volterra model (VFGLVM) for the overall model values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for both model values of Litecoin and Ripple. The 2-dimensional VFGLVM has a good accuracy for the overall forecasting values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for the forecasting values of Litecoin. By analysing values of Lyapunov exponents and patterns of the corresponding Lotka-Volterra models, the 2 and 3-dimensional models show a chaotic behavior. Forecasting values indicate a future slight linear increase in transacting Bitcoin and a future decreasing transaction of Litecoin and Ripple. Bitcoin will keep relatively higher transaction counts and Litecoin transaction counts will be everywhere higher than that of Ripple. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Multiresolution analysis and spillovers of major cryptocurrency markets
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB The paper explores market coherencies and volatility causal linkages of seven leading cryptocurrencies for a sample period from August 8, 2014 to February 2, 2018. Wavelet-based methods are used to examine market connectedness. Parametric and nonparametric tests are employed to investigate direction of volatility spillovers of the assets. Highlights of our results indicate that: (1) probable diversification benefits are confined from intraweek to monthly scales for specific market pairs, and also for the investment basket having all seven assets; (2) incremental predictive power becomes useful in unveiling the nonlinear nature of volatility feedback linkages within time-scales; and (3) the level of connectedness and volatility causal linkages are found to be sensitive to trading scales and the proxy for market volatility. Based on these results, investors and risk managers are cautioned to incorporate such market dynamics in any adopted trading strategy for these asset markets. We believe our findings hold much relevance for portfolio diversification and risk management.

AB As an emerging decentralized secure data management platform, blockchain has gained much popularity recently. To maintain a canonical state of blockchain data record, proof-of-work based consensus protocols provide the nodes, referred to as miners, in the network with incentives for confirming new block of transactions through a process of "block mining" by solving a cryptographic puzzle. Under the circumstance of limited local computing resources, e.g., mobile devices, it is natural for rational miners, i.e., consensus nodes, to offload computational tasks for proof of work to the cloud/fog computing servers. Therefore, we focus on the trading between the cloud/fog computing service provider and miners, and propose an auction-based market model for efficient computing resource allocation. In particular, we consider a proof-of-work based blockchain network, which is constrained by the computing resource and deployed as an infrastructure for decentralized data management applications. Due to the competition among miners in the blockchain network, the allocative externalities are particularly taken into account when designing the auction mechanisms. Specifically, we consider two bidding schemes: the constant-demand scheme where each miner bids for a fixed quantity of resources, and the multi-demand scheme where the miners can submit their preferable demands and bids. For the constant-demand bidding scheme, we propose an auction mechanism that achieves optimal social welfare. In the multi-demand bidding scheme, the social welfare maximization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we design an approximate algorithm which guarantees the truthfulness, individual rationality and computational efficiency. Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed auction mechanisms with the two bidding schemes can efficiently maximize the social welfare of the blockchain network and provide effective strategies for the cloud/fog computing service provider.

TI Bitcoin as a safe haven: Is it even worth considering?
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Research in cryptofinance has continued to consider whether Bitcoin possesses a safe haven property as traditionally defined by its correlation with other assets during times of market stress. However, this neglects other attributes of assets that are important to investors during periods of crisis. Bitcoin is more volatile, less liquid, and costlier to transact (in terms of time and fees) than other assets (including gold - the traditional safe haven) even in normal market conditions. Until the market matures, it is therefore unlikely to be worthwhile considering Bitcoin as a safe haven.

TI Bitcoin returns and risk: A general GARCH and GAS analysis
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This paper performs a general GARCH and GAS analysis for modelling and forecasting bitcoin returns and risk. Since Bitcoin trading exhibits excess volatility compared with other securities, it is important to model its risk and returns. We consider heavy-tailed GARCH models as well as GAS models based on the score function of the predictive conditional density of the bitcoin returns. We compare out-of-sample 1%-Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasts under 45 different specifications using three backtesting procedures. We find that GAS models with heavy-tailed distributions provide the best out-of-sample forecast and goodness-of-fit properties to bitcoin returns and risk modelling. Normally-distributed GARCH models are always outperformed by heavy-tailed GARCH or GAS models. Besides, heavy-tailed GAS models provide the best conditional and unconditional coverage for 1%-VaR forecasts, illustrating the importance of modelling excess kurtosis for bitcoin returns. Hence, our findings have important implications for risk managers and investors for using bitcoin in optimal hedging or investment strategies.

TI Herding in the cryptocurrency market: CSSD and CSAD approaches
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB We analyse the existence of herding in the cryptocurrency market through the cross-sectional standard (absolute) deviation of returns. Our results show that extreme dispersion of returns is explained by rational asset pricing models although it is possible to observe herding during down markets, which highlights the inefficiency and risk of cryptocurrencies. We also observe that the smallest digital currencies are herding with the largest ones, thus traders base their decisions on the performance of the main cryptocurrencies. However, the herding phenomenon cannot be solely attributed to Bitcoin, since the rest of the market is not herding with the main cryptocurrency.

TI Investigating the influence of organizational factors on blockchain
   adoption An innovation theory perspective
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB Purpose Blockchain possesses the potential to disrupt and reshape a plethora of industries in the next decade. However, blockchain adoption rates in technology developed countries, such as Ireland, are relatively low. Motivated by blockchain's potential to transform sociotechnical systems, the lack of systematic inquiry pertaining to blockchain studies from an information system perspective, the authors propose the following research question: "How do organizational factors influence blockchain adoption in organizations based in a developed country?" Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to elucidate the impact of organizational factors on the adoption of blockchain and the adoption of blockchain in companies based in Ireland. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and the methods of qualitative content analysis were used to identify the most important technology-organization-environment (TOE) blockchain adoption factors. Organizational factors are often viewed as the most significant determinants of IT innovation adoption in organizations. Consequently, using a multiple-case study of 20 companies based in Ireland, the authors investigate how the top three organizational factors identified from the blockchain literature affected these companies decision to adopt or not adopt blockchain. Findings The literature review on blockchain adoption identified specific technological, organizational and environmental factors. Furthermore, the case study findings identified three patterns: top management support and organizational readiness are enablers for blockchain adoption, and large companies are more likely to adopt blockchain than small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors explain these patterns by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a developed country. Practical and scientific contributions are also presented.
   Originality/value This is one of the first studies to identify specific TOE blockchain adoption factors. Further, the authors examine how the three most identified organizational adoption factors impact organizations decisions to adopt blockchain. Finally, the authors discuss how the resulting three patterns identified by examining the nature of blockchain and the characteristics of Ireland as a technology developed country.

TI BEST: Blockchain-based secure energy trading in SDN-enabled intelligent
   transportation system
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Tactile Internet is a fairly recent technological trend associated with the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era, with potential applications in a broad range of industrial, societal and business use cases. The real-time machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions (e.g., in unmanned vehicles and the underpinning infrastructure within the smart city ecosystem) in the intelligent transportation sector, for example, contribute to the potential utility of Tactile Internet in this particular sector (and the broader smart city). In the context of unmanned vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles and electric (ground) vehicles, one of several key challenges to its broader utility is how to design a secure energy trading ecosystem that can be used for purposes such as charging and discharging from the supporting smart grids. Most existing approaches in the literature focused on conventional and centralized security mechanisms, which may not be applicable for energy trading in a smart city environment. Moreover, the need for real-time processing for energy trading computation is one of the essential requirements of Tactile Internet. Therefore, to address these challenges, BEST: a Blockchain-based secure energy trading scheme for electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, in BEST, blockchain is used to validate EVs' requests in a distributed manner; thus, ensuring resilience against the single point of failure. The miner nodes are selected to validate the requests on the basis of energy requirements, time of stay, dynamic pricing, and connectivity record, as well as other factors that are crucial for the operator at the time of operation. Moreover, to provide low latency and real-time services, software-defined networking is used as the network's backbone to transfer EVs' requests to a global software defined network controller. Finally, BEST is evaluated on the basis of the communication and computation costs incurred during various transactions between the EVs and the smart grid. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the potential deployment of BEST in energy trading. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enabling the Internet of Mobile Crowdsourcing Health Things: A Mobile
   Fog Computing, Blockchain and IoT Based Continuous Glucose Monitoring
   System for Diabetes Mellitus Research and Care
SO SENSORS
AB Diabetes patients suffer from abnormal blood glucose levels, which can cause diverse health disorders that affect their kidneys, heart and vision. Due to these conditions, diabetes patients have traditionally checked blood glucose levels through Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) techniques, like pricking their fingers multiple times per day. Such techniques involve a number of drawbacks that can be solved by using a device called Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which can measure blood glucose levels continuously throughout the day without having to prick the patient when carrying out every measurement. This article details the design and implementation of a system that enhances commercial CGMs by adding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to them that allow for monitoring patients remotely and, thus, warning them about potentially dangerous situations. The proposed system makes use of smartphones to collect blood glucose values from CGMs and then sends them either to a remote cloud or to distributed fog computing nodes. Moreover, in order to exchange reliable, trustworthy and cybersecure data with medical scientists, doctors and caretakers, the system includes the deployment of a decentralized storage system that receives, processes and stores the collected data. Furthermore, in order to motivate users to add new data to the system, an incentive system based on a digital cryptocurrency named GlucoCoin was devised. Such a system makes use of a blockchain that is able to execute smart contracts in order to automate CGM sensor purchases or to reward the users that contribute to the system by providing their own data. Thanks to all the previously mentioned technologies, the proposed system enables patient data crowdsourcing and the development of novel mobile health (mHealth) applications for diagnosing, monitoring, studying and taking public health actions that can help to advance in the control of the disease and raise global awareness on the increasing prevalence of diabetes.

TI Credit-Based Payments for Fast Computing Resource Trading in
   Edge-Assisted Internet of Things
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The introduction of edge computing into blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) for offloading computational tasks is attracting increasing attention. Computing resource trading unavoidably happens in edgeassisted IoT. However, efficient computing resource trading cannot be achieved because of the "cold start" and "long return" problems. To address these challenges, we propose to use a credit-based payment for fast computing resource trading in edge-assisted blockchain-enabled IoT; therefore, the IoT nodes can finish fast payment and frequent trading by borrowing resource coins from other IoT nodes based on their credit values. In our resource-coin loan problem, we propose an iterative double-auction-based algorithm, where a broker is introduced to solve the loan allocation problem and to determine the size of the loan each lender would provide to each borrower. Furthermore, the broker enforces specific loan pricing rules to induce the borrowers and lenders to bid truthfully. Then, the hidden privacy information could be extracted to achieve the optimal resource-coin allocation and loan pricing. The proposed algorithm can maximize the economic benefits while protecting privacy. Simulations showed that the proposed algorithm can maximize social welfare. In addition, we compared the proposed algorithm with the credit-bank-based method in terms of the satisfaction function and payments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was individually rational, truthful, and budget-balanced.

TI FogBus: A Blockchain-based Lightweight Framework for Edge and Fog
   Computing
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Recently much emphasize is given on integrating Edge, Fog and Cloud infrastructures to support the execution of various latency sensitive and computing intensive Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although different real-world frameworks attempt to assist such integration, they have limitations in respect of platform independence, security, resource management and multi-application execution. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, named FogBus that facilitates end-to-end IoT-Fog(Edge)-Cloud integration. FogBus offers platform independent interfaces to IoT applications and computing instances for execution and interaction. It not only assists developers to build applications but also helps users to run multiple applications at a time and service providers to manage their resources. Moreover, FogBus applies Blockchain, authentication and encryption techniques to secure operations on sensitive data. Due to its simplified and cross platform software systems, it is easy to deploy, scalable and cost efficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FogBus by creating a computing environment with it that integrates finger pulse oximeters as IoT devices with Smartphone-based gateway and Raspberry Pi-based Fog nodes for Sleep Apnea analysis. We also evaluate the characteristics of FogBus in respect of other existing frameworks and the impact of various FogBus settings on system parameters through deployment of a real-world IoT application. The experimental results show that FogBus is comparatively lightweight and responsive, and different FogBus settings can tune the computing environment as per the situation demands.

TI RepuCoin: Your Reputation Is Your Power
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB Existing proof-of-work cryptocurrencies cannot tolerate attackers controlling more than 50 percent of the network's computing power at any time, but assume that such a condition happening is "unlikely". However, recent attack sophistication, e.g., where attackers can rent mining capacity to obtain a majority of computing power temporarily, render this assumption unrealistic. This paper proposes RepuCoin, the first system to provide guarantees even when more than 50 percent of the system's computing power is temporarily dominated by an attacker. RepuCoin physically limits the rate of voting power growth of the entire system. In particular, RepuCoin defines a miner's power by its 'reputation', as a function of its work integrated over the time of the entire blockchain, rather than through instantaneous computing power, which can be obtained relatively quickly and/or temporarily. As an example, after a single year of operation, RepuCoin can tolerate attacks compromising 51 percent of the network's computing resources, even if such power stays maliciously seized for almost a whole year. Moreover, RepuCoin provides better resilience to known attacks, compared to existing proof-of-work systems, while achieving a high throughput of 10000 transactions per second (TPS).

SO COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers, it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature, research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements such as food safety, food quality and food traceability.

TI Alkaline Stability of Quaternized Diels-Alder Polyphenylenes
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB Alkaline stability of anion exchange membranes (AEMs) is an essential requirement for the practical application of alkaline membrane fuel cells. In this study, we investigate the alkaline stability of Diels-Alder polyphenylenes (DAPPs) under various stability testing conditions. Structural analysis and membrane properties of the DAPPs indicated that different chemical structural changes of quaternized DAPPs occur depending on test conditions. Benzyltrimethylammonium-functionalized DAPPs degraded rapidly via nucleophilic benzyl substitution under a relatively mild condition at 80 degrees C with 4 M NaOH, whereas DAPPs with hexyltrimethylammonium (HTMA DAPP) exhibited much better alkaline stability under the same condition. While only cross-linking of unreacted alkyl bromides of HTMA DAPP occurred at 80 degrees C, we observed the degradation of the cations via beta elimination after long-term testing. At higher temperature or reduced relative humidity (RI-1) conditions, for example, 160 degrees C with 8 M NaOH or RH 10% at 100 degrees C, the rapid degradation of the cation in HTMA DAPP occurred via nucleophilic methyl substitution. These results suggest that accelerated stress tests may not be a quick and straightforward alternative to prolonged alkaline stability tests of AEMs.

TI Supply chain re-engineering using blockchain technology: A case of smart
   contract based tracking process
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The emergence of blockchain technology has created a number of potential innovations in handling business activities across various industries. However, few studies discuss the potential influence of blockchain technology from a business process re-engineering perspective. This study focuses on the feasibility and inceptive application of supply chain processes. We proposed a blockchain-based framework along with the use of an affiliated technology, i.e., smart contracts, to derive the feasible benefits of the supply chain process design. Through the illustrative design of an integrated process, we provide an achievable use case of the disintermediation of business processes via a conceptual, shared information ledger. This ledger not only facilitates the sharing of tracking information but also promotes a network for multilateral collaboration among supply chain members. The pursuit of transparency and accountability across supply chain processes can potentially influence decentralization and automation. A comparative analysis of the current and proposed frameworks is conducted to support the core reasoning of this study. Additionally, future implications on managerial practice and academic research are explored to provide pervasive suggestions for similar attempts in different sectors. We conclude with an evaluation of the potential influence of blockchain technology on supply chain management.

TI PTAS: Privacy-preserving Thin-client Authentication Scheme in
   blockchain-based PKI
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Recent years have witnessed tremendous academic efforts and industry growth in Internet of Things (loT). Security issues of loT have become increasingly prominent. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) can provide authentication service to loT devices which is a crucial element to the security of loT. However, the conventional PKIs are organized as a tree-like centralized structure which has demonstrated serious usability and security shortcomings such as the single point of failure. Blockchain has numerous desirable properties, such as decentralized nature, cryptographic technology and unalterable transaction record, these properties make it a potential tool to build a decentralized blockchain-based PKI. Nevertheless, the latest proposals for blockchain-based PKI did not take thin-clients into consideration where thin-clients indicate those users who cannot download the entire blockchain due to the limited storage capacity of their equipment (most loT devices fall into this category). To settle this problem, we firstly present a Privacy-preserving Thin-client Authentication Scheme (PTAS) employing the idea of private information retrieval (PIR), which enables thin-clients to run normally like full node users and protect their privacy simultaneously. Furthermore, in order to enhance security, we further propose a (m-1)-private PTAS which means thin-client's information can be protected against a collusion of at most (m-1) full node users. Besides, security analysis and functional comparison are performed to demonstrate high security and comprehensive functionality of our schemes. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to compare computational overhead and communication overhead of PTAS and (m-1)-private PTAS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this article, we examine the use of emerging blockchain applications in various migration and diaspora related initiatives in the emerging economies of Africa, Asia and Europe. By building on existing social networks of mutual obligation and quasi-ethnic affinities, blockchain technologies may facilitate the ability to enlarge the scope of diasporas and change the nature of belonging, sovereignty, migration and statehood. Through exploring the selective foregrounding of mutuality and materiality in such alternative value transfer systems, we seek to explain the dynamics of trust and agency that these networks generate to extend commitments and loyalties in the transnational space.

TI Forecasting Bitcoin risk measures: A robust approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
AB Over the last few years, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have attracted the interest of many investors, practitioners and researchers. However, little attention has been paid to the predictability of their risk measures. This paper compares the predictability of the one-step-ahead volatility and Value-at-Risk of Bitcoin using several volatility models. We also include procedures that take into account the presence of outliers and estimate the volatility and Value-at-Risk in a robust fashion. Our results show that robust procedures outperform non-robust ones when forecasting the volatility and estimating the Value at-Risk. These results suggest that the presence of outliers plays an important role in the modelling and forecasting of Bitcoin risk measures. (C) 2019 International Institute of Forecasters.

TI Bitcoin: Safe haven, hedge or diversifier? Perception of bitcoin in the
   context of a country's economic situation - A stochastic volatility
   approach
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The aim of the article is to verify whether bitcoin can act as a hedge, diversifier or safe haven on various stock markets, depending on the economic situation in the countries. To diversify the sample, we include five very different countries in our study: Japan, Venezuela, China, Estonia, and Sweden. Using daily data over the period 2014-2017, we estimate the dynamic conditional correlation model between main stock indices and bitcoin price in local currencies (Bitflyer - in the case of the yen, Kraken - in the case of the euro, Huobi in the case of yuan and LocalBitcoins in all the remaining cases), as well as between main stock indices and the bitcoin price in the US dollar (Bitfinex exchange). We apply the Stochastic Volatility Model with the Dynamic Conditional Correlation. We add binary variables into the dynamic correlation equation, indicating the occurrence of extreme return on the stock-exchange index in the lower 1%, 5% and 10% quantile. The conclusions vary, depending whether we consider trade on the local bitcoin exchanges or in the global one. We conclude that bitcoin was treated as a safe haven asset only in the case of Venezuela and investments in bolivars. In the case of local investments in Japan and China bitcoin behaved as a diversifier. In the bitcoin-friendly economies of Sweden and Estonia it acted as a weak hedge. In the case of the USD trade, the results suggest that bitcoin is a weak hedge with respect to all of the analyzed markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI How the blockchain enables and constrains supply chain performance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL DISTRIBUTION & LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the enabling and constraining roles of blockchain technology (BCT) in managerial work practices and conceptualise the technology-performance relationship in supply chain management (SCM). Design/methodology/approach A structured literature review and a theory-driven approach are used. A set of propositions are developed, suggesting how the use of BCT in supply chains can be understood to simultaneously enable and constrain SCM and performance. Findings The analysis identifies four enabling and three constraining blockchain identities to explain how the technology either "facilitates" or "impedes" SCM and supply chain performance. Traceability, which emanates from its ability to provide data immutability, ranks highly as a core innovation of the technology. The blockchain is mainly seen as an opportunity to exploit existing supply chain resources and competencies. Research limitations/implications - One limitation of the research is its conceptual nature. Future research should test the developed propositions empirically. Further research should focus on BCT as an opportunity to explore and as a relationship-building technology. More research is also needed focussing on the complex and simultaneous enabling and constraining effects of BCT in supply chains. Originality/value The paper shows the important and complex Janus-faced implications of embedding BCT in supply chains and demonstrates how organisational theory can be applied to explore the relationship between blockchain and SCM.

TI A Comprehensive Study of Security and Privacy Guidelines, Threats, and
   Countermeasures: An IoT Perspective
SO JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS
AB As Internet of Things (IoT) involvement increases in our daily lives, several security and privacy concerns like linkability, unauthorized conversations, and side-channel attacks are raised. If they are left untouched, such issues may threaten the existence of IoT. They derive from two main reasons. One is that IoT objects are equipped with limited capabilities in terms of computation power, memory, and bandwidth which hamper the direct implementation of traditional Internet security techniques. The other reason is the absence of widely-accepted IoT security and privacy guidelines and their appropriate implementation techniques. Such guidelines and techniques would greatly assist IoT stakeholders like developers and manufacturers, paving the road for building secure IoT systems from the start and, thus, reinforcing IoT security and privacy by design. In order to contribute to such objective, we first briefly discuss the primary IoT security goals and recognize IoT stakeholders. Second, we propose a comprehensive list of IoT security and privacy guidelines for the edge nodes and communication levels of IoT reference architecture. Furthermore, we point out the IoT stakeholders such as customers and manufacturers who will benefit most from these guidelines. Moreover, we identify a set of implementation techniques by which such guidelines can be accomplished, and possible attacks against previously-mentioned levels can be alleviated. Third, we discuss the challenges of IoT security and privacy guidelines, and we briefly discuss digital rights management in IoT. Finally, through this survey, we suggest several open issues that require further investigation in the future. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work is the first survey that covers the above-mentioned objectives.

TI Price clustering and sentiment in bitcoin
SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB While prior research provides evidence of price clustering in bitcoin, this study seeks to explain the unusual level of bitcoin price clustering using various measures of bitcoin-level and market-wide sentiment. Our results suggest that sentiment has a strong positive association with price clustering. In economic terms, a one standard deviation increase in sentiment - measured by Google Trends - explains about 2.5% to 5% of the unusual level of price clustering in Bitcoin. We also find that our results are robust when we use other measures of investor sentiment.

SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB This paper analyzes the connectedness between forex and cryptocurrencies using the quantile cross-spectral approach. The sample covers six forex and six cryptocurrencies over the period of September 2015 December 2017. Compared with the results obtained from standard correlations and DMCA, the quantile cross-spectral approach provides richer information on the dependence structure across different quantiles and frequencies. The results show that there are some significant negative dependencies between forex and cryptocurrencies from both the short- and long-term perspectives; thus, it is worth diversifying between these two asset groups. Moreover, the connection between cryptocurrencies is not as strong as is widely believed.

TI Towards Secure Industrial IoT: Blockchain System With Credit-Based
   Consensus Mechanism
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an indispensable role for Industry 4.0, where people are committed to implement a general, scalable, and secure IIoT system to be adopted across various industries. However, existing IIoT systems are vulnerable to single point of failure and malicious attacks, which cannot provide stable services. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) gains considerable interest. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present a blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism for IIoT. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which can guarantee system security and transaction efficiency simultaneously. In order to protect sensitive data confidentiality, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on directed acyclic graph-structured blockchains, which is more efficient than the Satoshi-style blockchain in performance. We implement the system on Raspberry Pi, and conduct a case study for the smart factory. Extensive evaluation and analysis results demonstrate that credit-based PoW mechanism and data access control are secure and efficient in IIoT.

TI Blockchain-Based Internet of Vehicles: Distributed Network Architecture

SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The rapid growth of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has brought huge challenges for large data storage, intelligent management, and information security for the entire system. The traditional centralized management approach for IoV faces the difficulty in dealing with real-time response. The blockchain, as an effective technology for decentralized distributed storage and security management, has already showed great advantages in its application of Bitcoin. In this paper, we investigate how the blockchain technology could be extended to the application of vehicle networking, especially with the consideration of the distributed and secure storage of big data. We define several types of nodes such as vehicle and roadside for vehicle networks and form several sub-blockchain networks. In this paper, we present a model of the outward transmission of vehicle blockchain data, and then give detail theoretical analysis and numerical results. This paper has shown the potential to guide the application of blockchain for future vehicle networking.

TI Where is my feature and what is it about? A case study on recovering
   feature facets
SO JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE
AB Developers commonly use features to define, manage, and communicate functionalities of a system. Unfortunately, the locations of features in code and other characteristics (feature facets), relevant for evolution and maintenance, are often poorly documented. Since developers change, and knowledge fades with time, such information often needs to be recovered. Modern projects boast a richness of information sources, such as pull requests, release logs, and otherwise specified domain knowledge. However, it is largely unknown from what sources the features, their locations, and their facets can be recovered. We present an exploratory study on identifying such information in two popular, variant-rich, and long-living systems: The 3D-printer firmware Marlin and the Android application Bitcoin-wallet. Besides the available information sources, we also investigated the projects' communities, communications, and development cultures. Our results show that a multitude of information sources (e.g., commit messages and pull requests) is helpful to recover features, locations, and facets to different extents. Pull requests were the most valuable source to recover facets, followed by commit messages and the issue tracker. As many of the studied information sources are, so far, rarely exploited in techniques for recovering features and their facets, we hope to inspire researchers and tool builders with our results.

TI Blockchain in the built environment and construction industry: A
   systematic review, conceptual models and practical use cases
SO AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION
AB The construction industry is facing many challenges including low productivity, poor regulation and compliance, lack of adequate collaboration and information sharing, and poor payment practices. Advances in distributed ledger technologies (DLT), also referred to as Blockchain, are increasingly investigated as one of the constituents in the digital transformation of the construction industry and its response to these challenges.
   The overarching aim of this study was to analyse the current state of DLT in the built environment and the construction sector with a view to developing a coherent approach to support its adoption specifically in the construction industry. Three objectives were established to achieve this: (a) to present the first state-of-the-art and literature review on DLT in the built environment and construction industry providing a consolidated view of the applications explored and potential use cases that could support disruption of the construction industry. Seven use-categories were identified: [1] Smart Energy, [2] Smart Cities & the Sharing Economy, [3] Smart Government, [4] Smart Homes, [5] Intelligent Transport, [6] BIM and Construction Management, and [7] Business Models and Organisational Structures; (b) to propose a framework for implementation composed of two conceptual models (i.e. the DLT Four-Dimensional Model, and the DLT Actors Model), developed according to extended socio-technical systems theory and including four dimensions (technical, social, process and policy), to support the development of DLT-based solutions that are adequate to the challenges faced by the construction industry. The DLT Four-Dimensional Model and the DLT Actors Model contribute to improve the understanding of the concepts involved when discussing DLT applications in construction and represent flexible, adaptable and scalable knowledge constructs and foundations that can be used for various further investigations; and (c) to appraise three specific use cases (i.e. Project Bank Accounts, regulation and compliance, and a single shared access BIM model) as potential areas for DLT through the application of a decision support tool. The results show that Project Bank Accounts (FBAs) and regulation and compliance are candidate areas for DLT applications and warrant further attention. However, for the third use case (i.e. single shared-access BIM model) DLT are still insufficiently developed at this time.
   The research shows that there is real potential for DLT to support digitalisation in the construction industry and enable solutions to many of its challenges. However, there needs to be further investigation of the readiness of the industry, its organisations and processes, and to evaluate what changes need to occur before implementation can be successful. Further investigations will include the development of a roadmap process incorporating the four dimensions to evaluate readiness across a series of use cases for the construction industry.

TI Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Carpooling Using Blockchain-Assisted
   Vehicular Fog Computing
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Carpooling enables passengers to share a vehicle to reduce traveling time, vehicle carbon emissions, and traffic congestion. However, the majority of passengers lean to find local drivers, but querying a remote cloud server leads to an unnecessary communication overhead and an increased response delay. Recently, fog computing is introduced to provide local data processing with low latency, but it also raises new security and privacy concerns because users' private information (e.g., identity and location) could be disclosed when these information are shared during carpooling. While they can be encrypted before transmission, it makes user matching a challenging task and malicious users can upload false locations. Moreover, carpooling records should be kept in a distributed manner to guarantee reliable data auditability. To address these problems, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving carpooling scheme using blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing to support conditional privacy, one-to-many matching, destination matching, and data auditability. Specifically, we authenticate users in a conditionally anonymous way. Also, we adopt private proximity test to achieve one-to-many proximity matching and extend it to efficiently establish a secret communication key between a passenger and a driver. We store all location grids into a tree and achieve get-off location matching using a range query technique. A private blockchain is built to store carpooling records. Finally, we analyze the security and privacy properties of the proposed scheme, and evaluate its performance in terms of computational costs and communication overhead.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a secure FaBric blockchain-based data transmission technique for industrial IoT. This technique uses the blockchain-based dynamic secret sharingmechanism. A reliable trading center is realized using the power blockchain sharing model, which can also share power trading books. The power data consensus mechanism and dynamic linked storage are designed to realize the secure matching of the power data transmission. Experiments show that the optimized FaBric power data storage and transmission has high security and reliability. The proposed technique can improve the transmission rate and packet receiving rate by 12% and 13%, respectively. Moreover, the proposed technique has good superiority in sharing management and decentralization.

TI LightChain: A Lightweight Blockchain System for Industrial Internet of
   Things
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB While the intersection of blockchain and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has received considerable research interest lately, the conflict between the high resource requirements of blockchain and the generally inadequate performance of IIoT devices has not been well tackled. On one hand, due to the introductions of mathematical concepts, including Public Key Infrastructure, Merkle Hash Tree, and Proof of Work (PoW), deploying blockchain demands huge computing power. On the other hand, full nodes should synchronize massive block data and deal with numerous transactions in peer-to-peer network, whose occupation of storage capacity and bandwidth makes IIoT devices difficult to afford. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain system called LightChain, which is resource-efficient and suitable for power-constrained IIoT scenarios. Specifically, we present a green consensus mechanism named Synergistic Multiple Proof for stimulating the cooperation of IIoT devices, and a lightweight data structure called LightBlock to streamline broadcast content. Furthermore, we design a novel Unrelated Block Offloading Filter to avoid the unlimited growth of ledger without affecting blockchain's traceability. The extensive experiments demonstrate that LightChain can reduce the individual computational cost to 39.32% and speed up the block generation by up to 74.06%. In terms of storage and network usage, the reductions are 43.35% and 90.55%, respectively.

AB In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based solution and framework for document sharing and version control to facilitate multi-user collaboration and track changes in a trusted, secure, and decentralized manner, with no involvement of a centralized trusted entity or third party. This solution is based on utilizing Ethereum smart contracts to govern and regulate the document version control functions among the creators and developers of the document and its validators. Moreover, our solution leverages the benefits of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to store documents on a decentralized file system. The proposed solution automates necessary interactions among multiple actors comprising developers and approvers. Smart contracts have been developed using Solidity language, and their functionalities were tested using the Remix IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The paper demonstrates that our smart contract code is free of commonly known security vulnerabilities and attacks. The code has been made publically available at Github. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI EdgeChain: An Edge-IoT Framework and Prototype Based on Blockchain and
   Smart Contracts
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On one hand, IoT devices are "weak" and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively "vulnerable" facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named "EdgeChain" based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or "coin" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.

We argue that blockchain technology affects the database engine of the accounting information system (AIS) through digitisation of the current paper-based validation process. In a blockchain-based AIS, accountants will no longer be the central authority but will remain the preparer of financial reports required by regulations; they will continue to influence policies such as the choice and accreditation of validators and serve as validators of last resort. Audit evidence still needs to be gathered for rendering of an audit opinion in a blockchain-based AIS. While digitisation of the validation process reduces the error rate and lowers the cost of vouching and tracing, and immutability of blockchain data reduces the incentive and opportunities for fraud, a blockchain-based AIS alone does not guarantee that financial reports are true and fair. Lower error rates and reduced incentives for accounting fraud in a blockchain-based AIS are expected to improve audit quality. This prediction will need to be empirically tested when blockchain-based AIS become available. Using the three-tier architecture of the AIS, this paper addresses the gap in the literature that misses how characteristics of blockchain technology can influence the implementation of a blockchain-based AIS with related implications for the accounting profession.

TI LRCoin: Leakage-Resilient Cryptocurrency Based on Bitcoin for Data
   Trading in IoT
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Currently, the number of Internet of Things (ha) devices making up the IoT is more than 11 billion and this number has been continuously increasing. The prevalence of these devices leads to an emerging IoT business model called Device-as-a-service, which enables sensor devices to collect data disseminated to all interested devices. The devices sharing data with other devices could receive some financial reward, such as Bitcoin. However, side-channel attacks, which aim to exploit some information leaked from the IoT devices during data trade execution, are possible since most of the IoT devices are vulnerable to be hacked or compromised. Thus, it is challenging to securely realize data trading in IoT environment due to the information leakage, such as leaking the private key for signing a Bitcoin transaction in Bitcoin system. In this paper, we propose LRCoin, a kind of leakage-resilient cryptocurrency based on bitcoin in which the signature algorithm used for authenticating bitcoin transactions is leakage-resilient. LRCoin is suitable for the scenarios where information leakage is inevitable, such as loT applications. Our core contribution is proposing an efficient bilinear-based continual-leakage-resilient ECDSA signature. We prove the proposed signature algorithm is unforgeable against adaptively chosen messages attack in the generic bilinear group model under the continual leakage setting. Both the theoretical analysis and the implementation demonstrate the practicability of the proposed scheme.

TI Security Attacks in Named Data Networking of Things and a Blockchain
   Solution
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is visioned to connect everything in the world by a common networking technique. In spite that Internet protocol is the most prevailing networking solution, it is difficult to adapt to loT which is born with scalability, heterogeneity, and dynamics. Thanks to the content-centric communication paradigm, it exerts data-naming strategy to incorporate the heterogeneity and dynamics so as to apply for IoT, composing Named Data Networking (NDN) of Things. However, the paradigm also introduces new types of security attacks. In this paper, the NDN of Things architecture will be illustrated and the security analysis is conducted. Furthermore, the potential security attacks of NDN of Things are categorized and the performance impact caused by security attacks is evaluated. Finally, the solutions for NDN of Things security attacks are discussed and a blockchain solution is illustrated.

TI Design and Implementation of an Integrated IoT Blockchain Platform for
   Sensing Data Integrity
SO SENSORS
AB With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is getting out of its infancy, into full maturity, and tends to be developed in an explosively rapid way, with more and more data transmitted and processed. As a result, the ability to manage devices deployed worldwide has been given more and advanced requirements in practical application performances. Most existing IoT platforms are highly centralized architectures, which suffer from various technical limitations, such as a cyber-attack and single point of failure. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data accessing, while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security. In this paper, we propose an integrated IoT platform using blockchain technology to guarantee sensing data integrity. The aim of this platform is to afford the device owner a practical application that provides a comprehensive, immutable log and allows easy access to their devices deployed in different domains. It also provides characteristics of general IoT systems, allows for real-time monitoring, and control between the end user and device. The business logic of the application is defined by the smart contract, which contains rules and conditions. The proposed approach is backed by a proof of concept implementation in realistic IoT scenarios, utilizing Raspberry Pi devices and a permissioned network called Hyperledger Fabric. Lastly, a benchmark study using various performance metrics is made to highlight the significance of the proposed work. The analysis results indicate that the designed platform is suitable for the resource-constrained IoT architecture and is scalable to be extended in various IoT scenarios.

TI Blockchain adoption: A value driver perspective
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB The ongoing discussion regarding blockchain technologies is focused primarily on cryptocurrencies, but blockchain features and functionalities have developed beyond financial instruments. As the technologies provide new functionalities, the associated value proposition changes as well. This study explores the relationship between blockchain technologies and their underlying value drivers. Four identified distinct blockchain stages of increased maturity are analyzed and discussed. This covers the evolutionary technology types focused on transactions, smart contracts, decentralized applications, and the introduction of artificial intelligence supporting decentralized decision making. In addition, we address management issues around appropriate blockchain adoption using a blockchain value driver-focused framework that gives decision makers actionable questions and recommendations. We provide practitioners with a method for assessing suitable blockchain adoption that addresses the specific value creation associated with a given organizational strategy. For academics, we critically identify and assess the characteristics of the blockchain stages and their strategy implications and provide a structured approach conceptualizing blockchain technology evolution.

TI Blockchain and the future of energy
SO TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB This paper discusses the emergence of blockchain technology in the energy sector in the light of ongoing energy market transformation. The study builds on literature research and expert interviews, and provides insights into the future energy landscape in the context of the blockchain advent. While the interviewees acknowledge the great, though disruptive, potential of blockchain technology for the primary activities in the electricity sector, there is agreement that inflexible regulatory frameworks impose the biggest challenge. The widest impact which blockchain technology will have in the short-term will be in electric vehicle integration, while in the long-term blockchain will enable peer-to-peer microgrids. The role that the blockchain will play, though, relies mainly on the business model innovation in energy. While a growing body of literature discusses specific blockchain applications and solutions in an advanced technological set-up, this paper presents a holistic picture of the blockchain applicability in the energy sector and thematises this very powerful and versatile technology against the background of two emerging economies: South Africa and Russia.

TI How Valuable Is FinTech Innovation?
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB We provide large-scale evidence on the occurrence and value of FinTech innovation. Using data on patent filings from 2003 to 2017, we apply machine learning to identify and classify innovations by their underlying technologies. We find that most FinTech innovations yield substantial value to innovators, with blockchain being particularly valuable. For the overall financial sector, internet of things (IoT), robo-advising, and blockchain are the most valuable innovation types. Innovations affect financial industries more negatively when they involve disruptive technologies from nonfinancial startups, but market leaders that invest heavily in their own innovation can avoid much of the negative value effect.

AB Blockchain and AI are promising techniques for next-generation wireless networks. Blockchain can establish a secure and decentralized resource sharing environment. Al can be explored to solve problems with uncertain, time-variant, and complex features. Both of these techniques have recently seen a surge in interest. The integration of these two techniques can further enhance the performance of wireless networks. In this article, we first propose a secure and intelligent architecture for next-generation wireless networks by integrating AI and blockchain into wireless networks to enable flexible and secure resource sharing. Then we propose a blockchain empowered content caching problem to maximize system utility, and develop a new caching scheme by utilizing deep reinforcement learning. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

TI Changing power: Shifting the role of electricity consumers with
   blockchain technology - Policy implications for EU electricity law
SO ENERGY POLICY
AB One of the pressing legal questions of the energy transition is how to integrate 1,rosumers", consumers who start producing electricity, in the electricity market. So far, their influence remains limited or fully absent because their role as independent market participants is barely or not facilitated as they are usually subject to regulated remuneration schemes. Blockchain technology offers changing the approach of "integration in the market" into "becoming the market" by enabling peer-to-peer transactions. Currently, transactions are facilitated by third parties, suppliers and system operators, whose main task is centrally compiling and coordinating information on loads and generation and contracting supply and distribution services. Instead, blockchain technology enables new ways of organising decentralised persons without the immediate need for one centrally connecting entity. This implies profound legal- and policy consequences. Based on information on first use cases of blockchain applications in the electricity sector, this article identifies those main policy implications for EU electricity law and thereby adds to the discussion how blockchain technology could facilitate `rosumers" to develop as independent market participants in the electricity sector from an energy law perspective.

TI Grey Lotka-Volterra models with application to cryptocurrencies adoption
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB The study uses grey Lotka-Volterra model (GLVM) of two and three dimensions for assessing the interaction between cryptocurrencies. The 2-dimensional study is on Bitcoin and Litecoin while the 3-dimensional study is on Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple. Records from 28-April-2013 to 10-February-2018 provide forecasting values for Bitcoin and Litecoin through 2-dimensional GLVM study, while records from 7-August-2013 to 10-February-2018 provide forecasting values of Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple through 3-dimensional GLVM study. The behaviour of Bitcoin and Litecoin or both Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple in future is proposed by looking at the 100 last forecasting values of n-dimensional GLVM study, n = {2, 3}. Lyapunov exponents of the 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra models reveals that it is a chaotic dynamical system. Plots of 2 and 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra models for filtered datasets suggest also a chaos. Using the mean absolute percentage error criterion, it was found that the accuracy of the GLVM is better than that of the grey model (GM(1,1)). By analysing the 2-dimensional GLVM, Bitcoin and Litecoin are found in the competition known as mutualism or equivalently a win-win situation where Bitcoin transaction is constant while Litecoin transaction has the increasing trend. The 3-dimensional GLVM analysis evokes however, an increasing trend in transacting both Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ripple where Bitcoin keep relatively higher transaction counts. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB Blockchain technologies are benefiting from significant interest in both societal and business contexts. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have grown rapidly in user adoption over the past 8 years. However, blockchain technologies, which fuel cryptocurrencies, have the potential to extend to other business applications even more profoundly. Blockchain can be leveraged to drive innovation and increase efficiencies in new domains including digital arts management, supply chains, and healthcare-but there remain technical, organizational, and regulatory head winds that must be overcome before mass adoption can occur. In this article, we provide a brief history of blockchain and identify some of the key features that have enabled its popular uptake in the world of cryptocurrencies. We discuss how blockchain technologies have evolved from traditional software and web technologies and then examine their underlying strengths and evaluate new, noncryptocurrency use cases. We conclude with a look at the limitations of blockchain and present several important factors for managers considering blockchain implementation within their organizations.

In addition, some confusion remains between the block chain (with definite article) and blockchain (no article), distributed ledger technologies, and their applications. Our article offers a primer on blockchain technology aimed at general managers and executives. The key contributions of this article lie in providing an explanation of blockchain, including how a blockchain transaction works and a clarification of terms, and outlining different types of blockchain technologies. We also discuss how different types of blockchain impact business models. Building on the well-established business model framework by Osterwalder and Pigneur, we outline the effect that blockchain technologies can have on each element of the business model, along with illustrations from firms developing blockchain technology.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The cryptocurrency market has emerged in recent years with profound implications to central financial institutions such as banking. Bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies were recently analyzed using methods from statistical physics, but focus was exclusively on behavior of prices. Here we explore multifractal behavior of daily price changes and daily volume changes of fifty cryptocurrencies using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Our results indicate that price changes are more complex than volume changes, and that large and small fluctuations dominate multifractal behavior of price and volume changes, respectively. We also find there is an absence of correlations in price changes, while volume changes present anti-persistent long-term correlations. Shuffling the series reveals that multifractality of both price and volume changes arises from a broad probability density function. The multifractal behavior of the cryptocurrency market is surprisingly similar to that of stock markets, but differs from that of regular exchange rates. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

While Narrow Band Internet of Things is gradually designed for commercial applications, it also confronts with several security concerns such as identification and privacy. Blockchain technique is equipped with authentication, auditing, and accountability, and thus it can serve as a promising tool for providing secure data communication on the network. To enhance the security level and achieve reliable data authentication and accountability for Narrow Band Internet of Things system, in this article, we combine the merits of blockchain technique and propose a blockchain-based architecture for Narrow Band Internet of Things. The presented architecture consists of three layers which are sensing layer, transport layer, and transaction layer. We describe the interaction processes between each layer in detail and construct the algorithms which are used to conduct data authentication and blockchain generation. By evaluation, our scheme is demonstrated to obtain favorable performances in terms of privacy, authentication, accountability, and efficiency, which makes it an appropriate method to be applied for secure data communication in Narrow Band Internet of Things systems.

AB Capable of aggregating multiple energy resources, the energy service company (ESCO) has been regarded as a promising alternative for improving power system flexibility and facilitate the consumption of renewable resources in the energy market. However, the issues have become significantly more serious related to the privacy and security of the data in consumption and trading. In this paper, we address the problem by proposing a privacy-preserving energy scheduling (PPES) model based on energy blockchain network. A Lagrangian relaxation method is applied to decompose the model into several individual optimal scheduling problems, and the individual scheduling problems are solved by consensus algorithm and smart contracts in energy blockchain network. The performance of the proposed model and method is evaluated with several case studies based on multiple energy nodes. Simulation results show the rationality and validity of the proposed method, and the model is conducive to the protection of environment and transparent scheduling of energy service companies (ESCOs). In addition, it can reflect the information of energy demand and supply to improve the privacy and security of data.

We estimate a multivariate stochastic volatility model with discontinuous jumps to mean returns and volatility. This formulation allows us to extract a time varying shared average volatility and to account for possible large outliers. Nine cryptocurrencies with roughly three years of daily price observations are considered in the sample. Our results point to two high volatility periods in 2017 and early 2018. Qualitatively, the permanent volatility component seems driven by major market developments, as well as the level of popular interest in cryptocurrencies. Transitory mean jumps become larger and more frequent starting from early 2017, further suggesting shifts in cryptocurrencies return dynamics. Calibrated simulation exercises suggest the long memory dependence features of cryptocurrencies are well reproduced by stationary models with jump components.

TI COIN-OPERATED CAPITALISM
SO COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW
AB This Article presents the legal literature's first detailed analysis of the inner workings of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). We characterize the ICO as an example of financial innovation, placing it in kinship with venture capital contracting, asset securitization, and (obviously) the IPO. We also take the form seriously as an example of technological innovation, in which promoters are beginning to effectuate their promises to investors through computer code, rather than traditional contract.
   To understand the dynamics of this shift, we first collect contracts, "whitepapers," and other disclosures for the fifty top-grossing ICOs of 2017. We then analyze how the software code controlling the projects' ICOs reflected (or failed to reflect) their disclosures. Our inquiry reveals that many ICOs failed even to promise that they would protect investors against insider self-dealing. Fewer still ma ;tested such promises in code. Surprisingly, in a community known for espousing a technolibertarian belief in the power of "trustless trust" built with carefully designed code, a significant fraction of issuers retained centralized control through previously undisclosed code permitting modification of the entities' governing structures.
   These findings offer valuable lessons to legal scholars, economists, and policymakers about the roles played by gatekeepers, the value of regulation, and the possibilities for socially valuable private ordering in a relatively anonymous, decentralized environment.

TI Intelligent Micro Energy Grid in 5G Era: Platforms, Business Cases,

SO ELECTRONICS
AB As fifth-generation mobile communication systems give rise to new smart grid technologies, such as distributed energy resources, advanced communication systems, the Internet of Things, and big data analytics, the development of novel platforms and business models that ensure reliability and profitability of microgrid operations become increasingly important. In this study, we introduce an open micro energy grid platform to operate the widely distributed microgrids in Korea. Subsequently, we present commercial microgrid business models supported by the open micro energy grid platform equipped with an artificial intelligence engine and provide test results from testbeds connected to the platform. In contrast to the existing microgrid business models in the market, we propose a universal architecture and business model of the future microgrid, comprising (i) an energy robot-management operation business model, (ii) electric vehicle-based demand response, (iii) blockchain technology for energy trading, and (iv) a service-oriented business model. Finally, we propose a new business model for an intelligent virtual power plant (VPP) operator along with the architecture of the VPP and its proof of concept (PoC). We expect the proposed business model to provide energy solution providers with guidelines to develop various VPP services.

TI Enhanced Security Framework for E-Health Systems using Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB An individual's health data is very sensitive and private. Such data are usually stored on a private or community owned cloud, where access is not restricted to the owners of that cloud. Anyone within the cloud can access this data. This data may not be read only and multiple parties can make to it. Thus, any unauthorized modification of health-related data will lead to incorrect diagnosis and mistreatment. However, we cannot restrict semipublic access to this data. Existing security mechanisms in e-health systems are competent in dealing with the issues associated with these systems but only up to a certain extent. The indigenous technologies need to be complemented with current and future technologies. We have put forward a method to complement such technologies by incorporating the concept of blockchain to ensure the integrity of data as well as its provenance.

TI Getting off the ground: the case of bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS
AB By declaring an item legal tender or making it publicly receivable, governments might generate sufficient demand to determine the medium of exchange. How do private actors launch a new money? There are two views in the literature. The first requires offering an item with a use value to some agents that is distinct from its role as a medium of exchange. The second suggests that agents might coordinate on an intrinsically useless item. With these views in mind, I survey the logs from the original bitcoin forum, bitcoin-list. I find that early participants in the bitcoin community understood the importance of coordination and took steps to coordinate users.

TI Distributed E-Voting and E-Bidding Systems Based on Smart Contract
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Traditional voting and bidding systems largely rely on paperwork and human resources throughout the voting process, which can incur high costs in terms of both time and money. Electronic voting and electronic bidding systems can be used to reduce costs, and many new systems have been introduced. However, most systems require a powerful and trusted third party to guarantee system integrity and security. With developments in blockchain technology, research has begun to highlight the core concept of decentralization. In this study, we introduce the first decentralized electronic voting and bidding systems based on a blockchain and smart contract. We also use cryptographic techniques such as oblivious transfer and homomorphic encryptions to improve privacy protection. Our proposed systems allow voters and bidders to participate in the opening phase and improve participant anonymity, the privacy of data transmission, and data reliability and verifiability. Moreover, compared with other electronic voting and bidding systems, our systems are safer and more efficient.

TI BBARS: Blockchain-Based Anonymous Rewarding Scheme for V2G Networks
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB In vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, battery-powered vehicle (BV) provides service to the power grid. In order to encourage more BVs to provide the service for power grid, it is necessary to reward the BVs from the power grid. To extensively deploy V2G networks, some security and privacy problems must be solved. In this paper, for the first time, we propose the novel concept of blockchain-based anonymous rewarding scheme (BBARS) for V2G networks. The novel concept comes from the application requirement which has not been solved by now. We give the formal system model and security model of BBARS. Then, we design the concrete BBARS scheme by making use of two different public key cryptosystem. Through security analysis and performance analysis, the designed scheme is provably secure and efficient. The analysis results also show the designed BBARS scheme is practical for secure V2G networks in smart grid.

TI Microgrid Group Trading Model and Solving Algorithm Based on Blockchain
SO ENERGIES
AB With the development of the energy Internet and the integration of multi-type energy situations, it is of great significance to study the competition game of a multi-agent microgrid group system for its development. As an emerging distributed database technology, blockchain technology has great application potential in the field of energy trading. Firstly, blockchain technology is coupled with the microgrid group transaction, and the information flow transaction model of a microgrid group based on blockchain technology is established. Aiming at this complex multi-objective optimization problem, an improved ant colony optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the model. Finally, the competitive trading model and solving algorithm are simulated and analyzed. The relevant results show that the near global optimum price strategy of each time based on the proposed model can effectively balance the efficiency of each subject in the market. In addition, the model ensures that there is no high-income and low-cost phenomenon in the trading process, therefore the security and quality of the market are guaranteed.

TI Blockchain based secure data sharing system for Internet of vehicles: A
   position paper
SO VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS
AB One of the benefits of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is improved traffic safety and efficiency, for example due to the capability to share vehicular messages in real-time. While most of the vehicular messages only need to be shared by nearby vehicles, some messages (e.g., announcement messages) may need to be more broadly distributed, for example to vehicles in a wider region. Finding a single trusted entity to store and distribute such messages can be challenging, and vehicles may not be inclined to participate (e.g., generation and distribution of announcement messages) unless they can benefit from such participation. In addition, achieving both security and privacy can be challenging. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based secure data sharing system to address the above challenges in an IoV setting. Specifically, in our system, announcement messages are stored using blockchain. To encourage/incentivize participation, vehicles that faithfully broadcast the announcement messages and/or contribute to the block generation will be rewarded by some cryptocurrency. Our system is also designed to be privacy-preserving and realizes both priori and posteriori countermeasures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Cryptocurrencies have attracted the attention of many investors and policymakers given the increase in popularity of Bitcoin. In this context, we analyse the cryptocurrency market by means of cap-weighted and equally weighted market portfolios that include all the altcoins available for three different periods (2015-2017, 2016-2017 and 2017). By using the most traditional tests of efficiency, we observe three main features of the cryptocurrency market: it is weak-form inefficient due to the behaviour of all the altcoins, it is more inefficient over time, especially in 2017, and the creation of new cryptocurrencies has not significantly changed the efficiency of the market.

TI Variables Influencing Cryptocurrency Use: A Technology Acceptance Model
   in Spain
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The first commercial transaction with the first cryptocurrency in 2010 marked the start of a revolution in transactions. Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dramatically transform how we do transactions, just as the Internet revolutionized how we communicate. Currently, more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies are quoted on the market, and many more are being launched in initial coin offerings for use as an exchange method in a specific business ecosystem or as rights to assets or liabilities. As an emerging fintech, cryptocurrencies open up many opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges and limitations. This paper analyzes the key factors for the successful development of a cryptocurrency from a consumer-behavior perspective. Using a technology acceptance theoretical framework, we test a model able to explain almost 85% of the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, risk was not a significant factor. This could be because most of the respondents considered operating with cryptocurrencies to be risky; the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power. However, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption. The performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success. The research was conducted in Spain with college-educated adults with basic knowledge of the Internet.

TI A Secured Proxy-Based Data Sharing Module in IoT Environments Using
   Blockchain
SO SENSORS
AB Access and utilization of data are central to the cloud computing paradigm. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the tendency of data sharing on the cloud has seen enormous growth. With data sharing comes numerous security and privacy issues. In the process of ensuring data confidentiality and fine-grained access control to data in the cloud, several studies have proposed Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) schemes, with Key Policy-ABE (KP-ABE) being the prominent one. Recent works have however suggested that the confidentiality of data is violated through collusion attacks between a revoked user and the cloud server. We present a secured and efficient Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) scheme that incorporates an Inner-Product Encryption (IPE) scheme in which decryption of data is possible if the inner product of the private key, associated with a set of attributes specified by the data owner, and the associated ciphertext is equal to zero . We utilize a blockchain network whose processing node acts as the proxy server and performs re-encryption on the data. In ensuring data confidentiality and preventing collusion attacks, the data are divided into two, with one part stored on the blockchain network and the other part stored on the cloud. Our approach also achieves fine-grained access control.

TI The drivers of Bitcoin demand: A short and long-run analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB Since 2010, Bitcoin has shown high price volatility, spurring a debate regarding the underlying reasons that lead economic agents to demand it. This paper analyzes the demand for Bitcoin in order to determine whether it stems from Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange, a speculative asset, or as a safe-haven commodity. We examine Bitcoin from a monetary-theory perspective and build a demand model that explores both the long-term and short-term relationships among variables. Our findings show that Bitcoin behaves as a speculative asset in the short term. In the long term, however, speculation does not seem to influence demand for Bitcoin. Instead, demand might be driven by expectations regarding Bitcoin's future utility as a medium of exchange.

TI Blockchain Electricity Trading Under Demurrage
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB This letter proposes a novel demurrage mechanism for blockchain electricity marketplaces, whereby the redemptive value of energy-backed tokens declines with time. This mechanism is intended to reward organic price-responsive load shifting by incentivising the consumption of electricity when it is locally abundant. To demonstrate how such a demurrage mechanism might function in practice, this letter describes a mixed complementarity model of a notional token marketplace. These market simulations indicate that, in equilibrium and with rational actors, the demurrage mechanism creates price signals that temporally align the production and consumption of electricity.

TI Blockchain Technology and Electricity Wholesale Markets: Expert Insights
   on Potentials and Challenges for OTC Trading in Europe
SO ENERGIES
AB In this manuscript, we investigate the adoption of blockchain for over-the-counter (OTC) electricity wholesale trading under the EU regulatory framework. Our analysis of the core legislation reveals six potential issues: (1) data immutability-related error correction, (2) personal data protection and immutability, (3) access to different data layers, (4) obligation and capacity to report, (5) identification of counterparties and (6) conflict of interest. These six issues were used as basis for a survey with experts in this field from industry and academia. The majority of our respondents indicated four major points: (i) reduction of transaction costs is the main expected benefit, (ii) the application of blockchain can be compliant with the current regulatory framework, (iii) a sandbox is the most welcome regulatory approach to reduce legal uncertainty, and (iv) the first use case to be commercially implemented is expected to be a P2P platform, ahead of a use case focused on post-trade processes. We believe that the results presented in this manuscript might serve as guidance for market participants aiming to enable the development of blockchain.

It argues that (contract) law remains relevant for most transactions even if they are entirely structured by way of smart contract. The reason for this is that the power of smart contracts to create and enforce obligations against attempts by the legal system to thwart their execution is limited. These limitations are most relevant for obligations to perform certain actions outside the blockchain, but also apply to other obligations contingent on facts outside the records stored on the blockchain.

In this article, I argue that the democratic potential of the blockchain hinges on the specific design of the rules governing the validation of blocks. In support of this argument, I shed light on the governance problems raised by standard protocols such as proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and on-chain voting.

TI Cryptocarbon: The promises and pitfalls of forest protection on a
   blockchain
SO GEOFORUM
AB In this commentary, we explore how blockchain is being leveraged to address the fundamental problems with market-based forest protection globally. In doing so, we consider the ways `cryptocarbon' initiatives are creating new challenges that have so far escaped critical scrutiny. A blockchain is a distributed and immutable electronic database - a ledger of every transaction that has ever taken place on a network, stored as cryptographically secured blocks, strung together in a chain. The technology is being increasingly hyped as applicable for a whole range of industries, social service provisions, and environmental management concerns. This includes the facilitation of natural asset market mechanisms, like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD + ). The original aim of REDD + was to incentivise conservation, making tropical forests more valuable standing than cut down. Multiple factors, including lack of consumer interest, created an oversupply of carbon commodities. Ninety-five percent of the world's avoided deforestation credits, representing millions of hectares of conserved forest, were stuck without a buyer. Several flagging REDD + projects are now hoping that blockchain technology can carry them to new heights of market capitalisation. However, like with any powerful new technology, the benefits remain ambiguous.

AB The article titled "Defining Supply Chain Management" published in 2001 in the Journal of Business Logistics has been cited over 4,900 times in the last 17 years. In this paper, we first provide a historical review of how the article originated and the contributions the article made to both the theory and practice of supply chain management (SCM). Next, we highlight the key market and technological changes that have emerged in SCM followed by how the theory proposed in the 2001 article can still be relevant to support SCM research and practice going forward. We also propose ways of configuring a supply chain and partnering across companies to serve customers in an optimal way. We conclude with a call for research on developing new frameworks to better describe, explain, predict, and shed light on the evolving nature of SCM.

TI Bitcoin price growth and Indonesia's monetary system
SO EMERGING MARKETS REVIEW
AB Concerned by the volatility of Bitcoin price growth (BPG), Bank Indonesia-Indonesia's central bank-discourages trading cryptocurrencies. We examine the relationship between Bitcoin price growth (BPG) and Indonesia's monetary aggregates (inflation, real exchange rate, and money velocity). In doing so, we develop the conceptual link between Bitcoin and monetary aggregates. We find strong and robust evidence that BPG leads to inflation growth, currency appreciation, and a reduction in money velocity. Our results have policy implications for other central banks in terms of achieving stability of the monetary system if BPG is indeed a concern for those countries.

TI Blockchain anchored supply chain automation
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Increasing globalization, e-commerce usage, and social awareness are leading to increased consumer demand for variety, value, convenience, immediacy, verifiable authenticity and provenance, ethical materials sourcing and manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and services after sales. Fulfilling this increased complexity of consumer demand has required supply chains to evolve into multienterprise networks with numerous flow paths in production, merchandising, and fulfillment involving many organizational/institutional handoffs, to effectively manage a large number of complex products with shorter life cycles and high transaction volumes. The supply chain management models of today place higher demands on automation and require a transition from the traditional paradigm of planning followed by long-loop execution for a handful of segments to a paradigm of managing a portfolio of end-to-end instrumented data-rich microsegmented supply chains that are monitored and adjusted in near real time. These essential aspects and challenges of supply chain management require the supporting information technology to also evolve. In this paper, we propose a novel reference software architecture to address the complex requirements of modern supply chains that also integrates blockchain into several layers of the stack. We present several examples where this reference architecture is applicable, and then demonstrate through a use case in production that integrating blockchain technology helps with providing visibility, documenting provenance, and allowing permissioned data access to facilitate the automation of many high-volume tasks such as reconciliations, payments, and settlements.

TI A novel hybrid share reporting strategy for blockchain miners in PPLNS
   pools
SO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB In blockchain pool mining, Pay-Per-Last-N-Shares (PPLNS) is one of the most commonly used reward mechanisms in practice, in which the mining pools will distribute the reward among the miners whose reported shares fall in the last N shares, according to the proportion of the number of shares of the miner in the last N shares. In the PPLNS mechanism, miners' reporting strategies may impose significant impacts to their rewards via determining the number of shares appeared in the last N shares. As such, how to strategically report their shares to the pool has become an important decision faced by miners. In this paper, we study the share reporting problem in PPLNS pools, and establish a share reporting model for a miner to optimize his/her rewards. We also propose a novel hybrid share reporting strategy for the miner based on our model, and design computational experiments to evaluate our hybrid share reporting strategy. The experimental results show that the hybrid strategy outperforms two baseline share reporting strategies commonly used in practice. This work is the first attempt to study the share reporting issue faced by miners in PPLNS pools, and it can provide important managerial insights for blockchain pool miners when making their share reporting decisions.

TI Identity-based public auditing for cloud storage systems against
   malicious auditors via blockchain
SO SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Cloud storage systems provide users with convenient data storage services, which allow users to access and update outsourced data remotely. However, these cloud storage services do not guarantee the integrity of the data that users store in the cloud. Thus, public auditing is necessary, in which a third-party auditor (TPA) is delegated to audit the integrity of the outsourced data. This system allows users to enjoy on-demand cloud storage services without the burden of continually auditing their data integrity. However, certain TPAs might deviate from the public auditing protocol and/or collude with the cloud servers. In this article, we propose an identity-based public auditing (IBPA) scheme for cloud storage systems. In IBPA, the nonces in a blockchain are employed to construct unpredictable and easily verified challenge messages, thereby preventing the forging of auditing results by malicious TPAs to deceive users. Users need only to verify the TPAs' auditing results in batches to ensure the integrity of their data that are stored in the cloud. A detailed security analysis shows that IBPA can preserve data integrity against various attacks. In addition, a comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that IBPA is feasible and efficient.

TI Regulation by Blockchain: the Emerging Battle for Supremacy between the
   Code of Law and Code as Law
SO MODERN LAW REVIEW
AB This paper critically examines the intersection and interactions between conventional law produced and enforced by national legal systems (ie the 'code of law') and the internal rules of blockchain systems, which take the form of executable software code and cryptographic algorithms operating across a distributed computing network ('code as law'). In so doing, it seeks to identify whether, and to what extent, 'regulation by blockchain' will successfully avoid governance by conventional law. It identifies three different ways in which the code of law is likely to interact with code as law, based primarily on the intended motives and purposes of those engaged in activities in developing, maintaining or undertaking transactions upon the network. It argues that these different classes of case are likely to generate different kinds of dynamic interaction between the blockchain code and conventional legal systems, and critically examines the normative foundations of these emerging and anticipated interactions.

TI Secure and Reliable IoT Networks Using Fog Computing with
   Software-Defined Networking and Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS
AB Designing Internet of Things (IoT) applications faces many challenges including security, massive traffic, high availability, high reliability and energy constraints. Recent distributed computing paradigms, such as Fog and multi-access edge computing (MEC), software-defined networking (SDN), network virtualization and blockchain can be exploited in IoT networks, either combined or individually, to overcome the aforementioned challenges while maintaining system performance. In this paper, we present a framework for IoT that employs an edge computing layer of Fog nodes controlled and managed by an SDN network to achieve high reliability and availability for latency-sensitive IoT applications. The SDN network is equipped with distributed controllers and distributed resource constrained OpenFlow switches. Blockchain is used to ensure decentralization in a trustful manner. Additionally, a data offloading algorithm is developed to allocate various processing and computing tasks to the OpenFlow switches based on their current workload. Moreover, a traffic model is proposed to model and analyze the traffic indifferent parts of the network. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in simulation and in a testbed. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves higher efficiency in terms of latency and resource utilization.

TI Is Blockchain Technology Suitable for Managing Personal Health Records?
   Mixed-Methods Study to Test Feasibility
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: There are many perspectives on the advantages of introducing blockchain in the medical field, but there are no published feasibility studies regarding the storage, propagation, and management of personal health records (PHRs) using blockchain technology.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of blockchains in the medical field in relation to transactions with and propagation of PHRs in a private blockchain.
   Methods: We constructed a private blockchain network using Ethereum version 1.8.4 and conducted verification using the de-identified PHRs of 300 patients. The private blockchain network consisted of one hospital node and 300 patient nodes. In order to verify the effectiveness of blockchain-based PHR management, PHRs at a time were loaded in a transaction between the hospital and patient nodes and propagated to the whole network. We obtained and analyzed the time and gas required for data transaction and propagation on the blockchain network. For reproducibility, these processes were repeated 100 times.
   Results: Of 300 patient records, 74 (24.7%) were not loaded in the private blockchain due to the data block size of the transaction block. The remaining 226 individual health records were classified into groups A (80 patients with outpatient visit data less than 1 year old), B (84 patients with outpatient data from between 1 and 3 years before data collection), and C (62 patients with outpatient data 3 to 5 years old). With respect to mean transaction time in the blockchain, C (128.7 seconds) had the shortest time, followed by A (132.2 seconds) and then B (159.0 seconds). The mean propagation times for groups A, B, and C were 1494.2 seconds, 2138.9 seconds, and 4111.4 seconds, respectively; mean file sizes were 5.6 KB, 18.6 KB, and 45.38 KB, respectively. The mean gas consumption values were 1,900,767; 4,224,341; and 4,112,784 for groups A, B, and C, respectively.
   Conclusions: This study confirms that it is possible to exchange PHR data in a private blockchain network. However, to develop a blockchain-based PHR platform that can be used in practice, many improvements are required, including reductions in data size, improved personal information protection, and reduced operating costs.

TI Clustering patterns in efficiency and the coming-of-age of the
   cryptocurrency market
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB The efficient market hypothesis has far-reaching implications for financial trading and market stability. Whether or not cryptocurrencies are informationally efficient has therefore been the subject of intense recent investigation. Here, we use permutation entropy and statistical complexity over sliding time-windows of price log returns to quantify the dynamic efficiency of more than four hundred cryptocurrencies. We consider that a cryptocurrency is efficient within a time-window when these two complexity measures are statistically indistinguishable from their values obtained on randomly shuffled data. We find that 37% of the cryptocurrencies in our study stay efficient over 80% of the time, whereas 20% are informationally efficient in less than 20% of the time. Our results also show that the efficiency is not correlated with the market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies. A dynamic analysis of informational efficiency over time reveals clustering patterns in which different cryptocurrencies with similar temporal patterns form four clusters, and moreover, younger currencies in each group appear poised to follow the trend of their 'elders'. The cryptocurrency market thus already shows notable adherence to the efficient market hypothesis, although data also reveals that the coming-of-age of digital currencies is in this regard still very much underway.

TI A Trusted Routing Scheme Using Blockchain and Reinforcement Learning for
   Wireless Sensor Networks
SO SENSORS
AB A trusted routing scheme is very important to ensure the routing security and efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There are a lot of studies on improving the trustworthiness between routing nodes, using cryptographic systems, trust management, or centralized routing decisions, etc. However, most of the routing schemes are difficult to achieve in actual situations as it is difficult to dynamically identify the untrusted behaviors of routing nodes. Meanwhile, there is still no effective way to prevent malicious node attacks. In view of these problems, this paper proposes a trusted routing scheme using blockchain and reinforcement learning to improve the routing security and efficiency for WSNs. The feasible routing scheme is given for obtaining routing information of routing nodes on the blockchain, which makes the routing information traceable and impossible to tamper with. The reinforcement learning model is used to help routing nodes dynamically select more trusted and efficient routing links. From the experimental results, we can find that even in the routing environment with 50% malicious nodes, our routing scheme still has a good delay performance compared with other routing algorithms. The performance indicators such as energy consumption and throughput also show that our scheme is feasible and effective.

TI Energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining: A study of electricity
   consumption in mining cryptocurrencies
SO ENERGY
AB Cryptocurrency is a relatively new combination of cryptology and currency in financial areas and is increasingly frequently used worldwide. Blockchain applications are expected to reshape the renewable energy market. However, there is a lack of studies covering the power usage of digital currencies. Therefore, this study ran experiments on mining efficiency of nine kinds of cryptocurrencies and ten algorithms. A comparison of statistical analysis of data in a benchmark and experiment results of Monero mining was conducted. Thereafter, this study provided an estimation of global electricity consumption of the Monero mining activity. The results indicated that the hashing algorithm mainly determines the mining efficiency. Data analysis and experiments and estimated Monero mining electricity consumption in the world and its carbon emission in China as a case study. In 2018, Monero mining may consume 645.62 GWh of electricity in the world after its hard fork. The Monero mining in China may consume 30.34 GWh and contribute a carbon emission of 19.12-19.42 thousand tons from April to December in 2018. Although cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology are promising, their influence on energy conversation and sustainable development should be further studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Predicting the direction, maximum, minimum and closing prices of daily
   Bitcoin exchange rate using machine learning techniques
SO APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING
AB Bitcoin is the most accepted cryptocurrency in the world, which makes it attractive for investors and traders. However, the challenge in predicting the Bitcoin exchange rate is its high volatility. Therefore, the prediction of its behavior is of great importance for financial markets. In this way, recent studies have been carried out on what internal and/or external Bitcoin information is relevant to its prediction. The increased use of machine learning techniques to predict time series and the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments motivated the present study to seek more accurate predictions for the Bitcoin exchange rate. In this way, in a first stage of the proposed methodology, different feature selection techniques were evaluated in order to obtain the most relevant attributes for the predictions. In the sequence, it was analyzed the behavior of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Ensemble algorithms (based on Recurrent Neural Networks and the k-Means clustering method) for price direction predictions. Likewise, the ANN and SVM were employed for regression of the maximum, minimum and closing prices of the Bitcoin. Moreover, the regression results were also used as inputs to try to improve the price direction predictions. The results showed that the selected attributes and the best machine learning model achieved an improvement of more than 10%, in accuracy, for the price direction predictions, with respect to the state-of-the-art papers, using the same period of information. In relation to the maximum, minimum and closing Bitcoin prices regressions, it was possible to obtain Mean Absolute Percentage Errors between 1% and 2%. Based on these results, it was possible to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology when compared to other studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Simulation Model for Blockchain Systems Using Queuing Theory
SO ELECTRONICS
AB In recent years, blockchains have obtained so much attention from researchers, engineers, and institutions; and the implementation of blockchains has started to revive a large number of applications ranging from e-finance, e-healthcare, smart home, Internet of Things, social security, logistics and so forth. In the literature on blockchains, it is found that most articles focused on their engineering implementation, while little attention has been devoted to the exploration of theoretical aspects of the system; however, the existing work is limited to model the mining process only. In this paper, a queuing theory-based model is proposed for understanding the working and theoretical aspects of the blockchain. We validate our proposed model using the actual statistics of two popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, by running simulations for two months of transactions. The obtained performance measures parameters such as the Number of Transactions per block, Mining Time of Each Block, System Throughput, Memorypool count, Waiting Time in Memorypool, Number of Unconfirmed Transactions in the Whole System, Total Number of Transactions, and Number of Generated Blocks; these values are compared with actual statistics. It was found that the results gained from our proposed model are in good agreement with actual statistics. Although the simulation in this paper presents the modeling of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies only, the proposed model can be used to represent a wide range of blockchain-based systems.

TI Trend Prediction Classification for High Frequency Bitcoin Time Series
   with Deep Learning
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB We provide a trend prediction classification framework named the random sampling method (RSM) for cryptocurrency time series that are non-stationary. This framework is based on deep learning (DL). We compare the performance of our approach to two classical baseline methods in the case of the prediction of unstable Bitcoin prices in the OkCoin market and show that the baseline approaches are easily biased by class imbalance, whereas our model mitigates this problem. We also show that the classification performance of our method expressed as the F-measure substantially exceeds the odds of a uniform random process with three outcomes, proving that extraction of deterministic patterns for trend classification, and hence market prediction, is possible to some degree. The profit rates based on RSM outperformed those based on LSTM, although they did not exceed those of the buy-and-hold strategy within the testing data period, and thus do not provide a basis for algorithmic trading.

TI Regulating Cryptocurrencies: A Supervised Machine Learning Approach to
   De-Anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency whose transactions are recorded on a distributed, openly accessible ledger. On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity's real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with approximate to 385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of approximate to 79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem. We discuss the potential applications of our method for organizational regulation and compliance, societal implications, outline study limitations, and propose future research directions. A prototype implementation of our method for organizational use is included in the appendix.

TI Blockchain Applications - Usage in Different Domains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Originally conceived as a mechanism to enable a trustless cryptocurrency - Bitcoin, blockchain has since unbound itself from its original purpose as an increasing number of industries and stakeholders' eye the technology as an attractive alternative to solve existing business solutions as well as disrupt mature industries. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the blockchain technology, tracking its increase in popularity in relation to similar technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. The objective of this paper is to identify the current standing of the blockchain technology within the literature while also identifying the major fields of study and areas of application for which blockchain offers a valuable solution. This paper finds that unique features to the blockchain, such as privacy, security, anonymity, decentralization, and immutability, provide valuable benefits to various fields and subjects. This paper also finds that exploring the application of blockchain has only begun with some limited studies in areas, such as the Internet of Things, energy, finance, healthcare, and government, that also stand to benefit disproportionately from its implementation.

TI Convening Technologies: Blockchain and the Music Industry
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB This article traces the debates occurring in the music industry where blockchain technology surged as an ideal solution for long-standing disagreements over distribution, publishing, licensing, sales, streaming, and listening. The projections (in conferences, media, opinion pieces, and academic reports) started as techno-utopian, but over time the discourse shifted from "radical" to "incorporative" goals. The technological dreams were scaled back as the scope of social challenges to technological solutions became clearer. Borrowing from Clive Barnett's theory of convening publics, we argue that the role of the blockchain in this environment was not necessarily as a technological solution, but rather as a "convening" force that brought disparate actors together. Nonetheless, we still have to ask, who is invited to convene, and who is left out?

TI An analysis of price discovery between Bitcoin futures and spot markets
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper analyzes the Bitcoin price discovery process. We collect data on futures and spot prices for the period December 2017 to May 2018 and compute Hasbrouck's information share and Gonzalo and Granger's common factor component to quantify the contribution of each market to the price discovery process. Both measures coincide in suggesting that the Bitcoin futures market dominates the price discovery process. We also find that both prices are driven by a common factor that is given by a weighted combination of the futures and spot market. Finally, we observe that deviations from the equilibrium condition equating the futures and spot log-price have predictive ability for the return on the Bitcoin spot price but not on the futures price.

AB Wireless sensor networks are an easy target for report fabrication attacks, where compromised sensor nodes can be used by an adversary to flood the network with bogus/false reports. En-route filtering is a mechanism where intermediate forwarding nodes identify and drop false reports while they are being forwarded towards the sink. Existing en-route filtering schemes either have high storage overhead or low filtering efficiency. In this article, we propose a blockchain based deterministic en-route filtering scheme, capable of dropping false reports efficiently. Further, the proposed scheme does not require any key exchange between sensor nodes for data endorsement/authentication, thus reducing the associated key storage overhead and communication overhead. Finally, the proposed scheme can also adapt to dynamic networks and mobile sinks making it suitable for modern wireless sensor networks.

TI A New Lattice-Based Signature Scheme in Post-Quantum Blockchain Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology has gained significant prominence in recent years due to its public, distributed, and decentration characteristics, which was widely applied in all walks of life requiring distributed trustless consensus. However, the most cryptographic protocols used in the current blockchain networks are susceptible to the quantum attack with rapid development of a sufficiently large quantum computer. In this paper, we first give an overview of the vulnerabilities of the modern blockchain networks to a quantum adversary and some potential post-quantum mitigation methods. Then, a new lattice-based signature scheme has been proposed, which can be used to secure the blockchain network over existing classical channels. Meanwhile, the public and private keys are generated by the Bonsai Trees technology with RandBasis algorithm from the root keys, which not only ensure the randomness, but also construct the lightweight nondeterministic wallets. Then, the proposed scheme can be proved secure in random oracle model, and it is also more efficient than similar literatures. In addition, we also give the detailed description of the post-quantum blockchain transaction. Furthermore, this work can help to enrich the research on the future post-quantum blockchain (PQB).

TI Privacy-Oriented Blockchain-Based Distributed Key Management
   Architecture for Hierarchical Access Control in the IoT Scenario
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the explosive growth of valuable data produced by user equipment have led to strong demand for access control, especially hierarchical access control, which is performed from a group communication perspective. However, the key management strategies for such a future Internet are based mostly on a trusted third party that requires full trust of the key generation center (KGC) or central authority (CA). Recent studies indicate that centralized cloud centers will be unlikely to deliver satisfactory services to customers because we place too much trust in third parties; therefore, these centers do not apply to user privacy-oriented scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by proposing a novel blockchain-based distributed key management architecture (BDKMA) with fog computing to reduce latency and multiblockchains operated in the cloud to achieve cross-domain access. The proposed scheme utilizes blockchain technology to satisfy the decentralization, fine-grained auditability, high scalability, and extensibility requirements, as well as the privacy-preserving principles for hierarchical access control in IoT. We designed system operations methods and introduced different authorization assignment modes and group access patterns to reinforce the extensibility. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with existing models using various performance measures. The simulation results show that the multiblockchain structure substantially improves system performance, and the scalability is excellent as the network size increases. Furthermore, dynamic transaction collection time adjustment enables the performance and system capacity to be optimized for various environments.

AB by adopting the vision of Industry 4.0, many industrial sectors are eyeing the potential for advancing their systems to achieve higher productivity, cost-effectiveness, reliability, quality, and flexibility. One important sector that can greatly benefit from adopting Industry 4.0 principles and technologies is the manufacturing industry. This will help create the smart manufacturing era where advanced technologies and systems in Industry 4.0 will enhance the different processes within the manufacturing value chain and increase efficiency and profitability. However, Industry 4.0 requires effective integration of many technologies and systems and seamless operations across all components. This creates many challenges when creating applications for smart manufacturing including security, trust, traceability, reliability, and agreement automation within the manufacturing value chain. Several of these challenges can be addressed using blockchain. This paper discusses how blockchain can support smart manufacturing applications in manufacturing. In addition, the paper proposes a middleware approach for utilizing blockchain services and capabilities to enable more secure, trustable, traceable, reliable, and autonomous smart manufacturing applications. This approach will offer many advantages to secure and establish good trust among involved parties in the manufacturing value chain. In addition, this will enable a verity of new applications to realize the promising benefits of Industry 4.0 for smart manufacturing.

TI BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AND BIM PROCESS: REVIEW AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION
AB A Blockchain Technology (BCT) is an emergent digital technology that in recent years has gained widespread traction in various industrial, public, and business sectors; primarily in financial and banking realms owing to the rapid increase of cryptocurrency valuation in recent years. A blockchain Technology (BCT) is, in essence, a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. It was introduced as the working mechanism that formed the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain extensive mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. It was evident that the underlying principles characteristic of BCT functional attributes and secure digital infrastructure could find application in nearly any conceivable industry. BCT aims at creating a system that would be a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring and cyber-resilient system that assures the facilitation and protection of truly efficient data exchange system.
   This research depicts a survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry and examines the potential incorporation within the Building Information Modeling (BIM) process. Furthermore, the paper investigates how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM workflow by emphasizing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The focus on collaboration and the distributed nature of both technologies imply the suitability for implementing an integrative framework, and in extension, posit that effectively leveraging DLT's robust, reliable, and secure network infrastructure, and BIM workflow processes can be significantly enhanced. The paper examines the fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their prospective future applications and current advances, and their categorization based on intrinsic characteristics of consensus reaching and permissions. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the design review process such as using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas. HLF is the underlying BCT infrastructure that can serve to highlight key postulations to elucidate the idealized BIM workflow aptly.

AB Resource-constrained distributed systems such as the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing and fog computing are deployed for real-time monitoring and evaluation. Current security solutions are problematic when there is a centralized controlling entity. The blockchain provides decentralized security architectures using proof-of-work (PoW). Proof-of-work is an expensive process for IoT and edge computing due to the deployment of resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a novel consensus algorithm called Proof-of-Authentication (PoAh) to replace Proof-of-Work and introduce authentication in such environments to make the blockchain application-specific. This paper implemented the Proof-of-Authentication system to evaluate its sustainability and applicability for the IoT and edge computing. The evaluation process is conducted in both simulation and real-time testbeds to evaluate performance. Finally, the process of Proof-of-Authentication and its integration with blockchain in resource-constrained distributed systems is discussed. Our proposed PoAh, while running in limited computer resources (e.g. single-board computing devices like the Raspberry Pi) has a latency in the order of 3 secs.

SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Blockchain is emerging as a promising technology that is able to support transparent, secure, and immutable transactions traceability in decentralized networks. Its usage in many application domains, including the Internet of Things, is gaining the attention of even more researchers and industries worldwide. In line with current research interests, the work presented in this letter has been carried out in the context of the European H2020 symbIoTe project. Among its main features, the symbIoTe framework offers bartering functionalities across a federation of Internet of Things platforms. This letter extends the baseline implementation of bartering functionalities and formulates a novel methodology that properly integrates and takes advantages from the Blockchain technology. Even if the proposed approach is general, the main facets characterizing the conceived approach are illustrated through a fictional use case envisaging the provisioning of Intelligent Transportation System and air pollution services in a Smart City.

AB Cryptocurrencies have provided a promising infrastructure for pseudonymous online payments. However, low throughput has significantly hindered the scalability and usability of cryptocurrency systems for increasing numbers of users and transactions. Another obstacle to achieving scalability is the requirement for every node to duplicate the communication, storage, and state representation of the entire network.
   In this paper, we introduce the Asynchronous Consensus Zones, which scales blockchain system linearly without compromising decentralization or security. We achieve this by running multiple independent and parallel instances of single- chain consensus systems termed as zones. The consensus happens independently within each zone with minimized communication, which partitions the workload of the entire network and ensures a moderate burden for each individual node as the network grows. We propose eventual atomicity to ensure transaction atomicity across zones, which achieves the efficient completion of transactions without the overhead of a two- phase commit protocol. Additionally, we propose Chu- ko- nu mining to ensure the effective mining power in each zone to be at the same level of the entire network, making an attack on any individual zone as hard as that on the full network. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our work: on a testbed including 1,200 virtual machines worldwide to support 48,000 nodes, our system delivers 1,000 x throughput and 2,000 x capacity over the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.

TI Secure Identifier Management Based on Blockchain Technology in NDN
   Environment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the recent increase in the number of IoT devices and the development of centralized management systems, risks in cyber space, including personal information phishing, malicious code infection, hacking, and DDos attack, are becoming major issues in the real world. The recently developed distributed data management technology, blockchain, provides reliability in transactions without the intervention of a third party. This new technology, blockchain, promotes integrity and reliability of transaction records by allowing for all network participants to jointly own and verify data, which was previously done by a central server. Due to distributed data management, the technology can reduce brokerage fees and construction costs, and guarantees high levels of integrity and security of data. This paper examines the effective identifier management using blockchain technology under the named data networking environment. The proposed system does not expose a specific user's identifier by creating a transaction using the content name of the identifier. The identifier can be safely stored and managed through such an identifier split management technique.

TI Blockchain-Based Traffic Event Validation and Trust Verification for
   VANETs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Sharing traffic information on the vehicular network can help in the implementation of intelligent traffic management, such as car accident warnings, road construction notices, and driver route changes to reduce traffic congestion earlier. In the future, in the case of autonomous driving, traffic information will be exchanged more frequently and more immediately. Once the exposed traffic incident is incorrect, the driving route will be misleading, and the driving response may be in danger. The blockchain ensures the correctness of data and tampers resistance in the consensus mechanism, which can solve such similar problems. This paper proposes a proof-of-event consensus concept applicable to vehicular networks rather than proof-of-work or proof-of-authority approaches. The traffic data are collected through the roadside units, and the passing vehicles will verify the correctness when receiving the event notification. In addition, a two-phase transaction on blockchain is introduced to send warning messages in appropriate regions and time periods. The simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can effectively feedback the correctness of traffic events and provide traceable events with trust verification.

AB A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger that can record transactions between parties in a verifiable and permanent manner. Each node contains its ledger, and the contents of each ledger are maintained to be the same by a consensus algorithm. It is essential to ensure the safety and liveness of the consensus algorithms in blockchain platforms. The Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which is a consensus algorithm for the Stellar cryptocurrency using the blockchain, is utilized for the federated Byzantine agreement. The quorum configuration is one of the essential factors for ensuring the safety and liveness of the SCP; however, it has been rarely studied. In this study, we model the SCP with timed automata and verify the model using a model checking technique, with the purpose of investigating and evaluating the SCP. Through the modeling and verification of the SCP, we could check whether a certain quorum configuration ensures consensus or not, before execution on an actual network. We present several abstraction techniques that help in coping with the extremely large state space of the SCP model in formal verification. The proposed modeling and verification techniques can be utilized for other consensus protocols of various blockchain platforms using the Byzantine agreement.

TI Decentralized Big Data Auditing for Smart City Environments Leveraging
   Blockchain Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The idea of big data has gained extensive attention from governments and academia all over the world. It is especially relevant for the establishment of a smart city environment combining complex heterogeneous data with data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Big data is generated from many facilities and sensor networks in smart cities and often streamed and stored in the cloud storage platform. Ensuring the integrity and subsequent auditability of such big data is essential for the performance of AI-driven data analysis. Recent years has witnessed the emergence of many big data auditing schemes that are often characterized by third party auditors (TPAs). However, the TPA is a centralized entity, which is vulnerable to many security threats from both inside and outside the cloud. To avoid this centralized dependency, we propose a decentralized big data auditing scheme for smart city environments featuring blockchain capabilities supporting improved reliability and stability without the need for a centralized TPA in auditing schemes. To support this, we have designed an optimized blockchain instantiation and conducted a comprehensive comparison between the existing schemes and the proposed scheme through both theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation. The comparison shows that lower communication and computation costs are incurred with our scheme than with existing schemes.

AB Blockchain technology enables the formation of a distributed record of a digital event in decentralized manner where data and related transactions are not under the control of any third party. This technology was early used for value transfer but now it has vast range of applications in different fields such as healthcare, banking, internet of things and many others. In the field of education, it also provides numerous opportunities for decentralized management of records in educational institutions in an interoperability manner. The main objective of this research is to highlight the existing issues related to the educational institutes and to find suitable blockchain features that could resolve them. We have adopted a systematic literature review approach for the identification and the extraction of relevant information from the shortlisted studies. This study describes existing issues in three aspects physical, digital and financial. The results of the analysis shows that the manipulation risk, difficulty in verification and exchanging record between institutions are the major issues faced by the educational institutions. This study, then explores blockchain features including decentralization, traceability and consensus mechanism that can be used to address the issues related to the educational institution. Finally, due to unique and underlying technology, it has still some technical challenges and boundaries along with immutability feature, disclosure of personal privacy and scalability issue also discussed in this study.

AB In this paper, we formulate the consensus problem and its solutions as seen in public blockchains and contrast them to those of the traditional distributed consensus. The Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm introduced in Bitcoin provides the first elegant and practical solution for reaching distributed consensus in a large-scale untrusted environment. Due to the enormous energy cost of PoW, many alternative consensus algorithms have been proposed for public blockchains aiming at drastically reducing the energy consumption for reaching consensus. We examine four blockchain consensus algorithms, namely Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, Proof of Space, and Proof of Elapsed Time, with respect to the consensus model we have formulated and point out the challenges of adopting them in public blockchains.

TI Activity-aware essential tremor evaluation using deep learning method
   based on acceleration data
SO PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS
AB Background: Essential tremor (ET), one of the most common neurological disorders is typically evaluated with validated rating scales which only provide a subjective assessment during a clinical visit, underestimating the fluctuations tremor during different daily activities. Motion sensors have shown favorable performances in both quantifying tremor and voluntary human activity recognition (HAR).
   Objective: To create an automated system of a reference scale using motion sensors supported by deep learning algorithms to accurately rate ET severity during voluntary activities, and to propose an IOTA based blockchain application to share anonymously tremor data.
   Method: A smartwatch-based tremor monitoring system was used to collect motion data from 20 subjects while they were doing standard tasks. Two neurologists rated ET by Fahn-Tolosa Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS). Supported by deep learning techniques, activity classification models (ACMs) and tremor evaluation models (TEMs) were created and algorithms were implemented, to distinguish voluntary human activities and evaluate tremor severity respectively.
   Result A practical application example showed that the proposed ACMs can classify six typical activities with high accuracy (89.73%-98.84%) and the results produced by the TEMs are significantly correlated with the FTMTRS ratings of two neurologists (r(1 )= 0.92, p(1) = 0.008; r(2) = 0.93, p(2) = 0.007).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that motion sensor data, supported by deep learning algorithms, can be used to classify human activities and evaluate essential tremor severity during different activities.

TI Multiscale fluctuations and complexity synchronization of Bitcoin in

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Bitcoin appeared as a currency, but it is treated as a speculative product due to its violent fluctuation. The main purpose of this article is to find out the fluctuations similarities and differences between China and US Bitcoin markets, as well as Bitcoin market and stock market by Econophysics. We use the multiscale composite complexity synchronization (MCCS) correlation to study the complexity synchronization of Bitcoin price and stock indices fluctuations in those two markets. And we use the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) to analyze the inner fractal features of each time series's small and large fluctuations. The corresponding shuffled time series are also utilized to do the above two kinds of analysis, in order to distinguish what lead to the complexity synchronization and multifractal properties, the different long-range correlations for the times series' small and large fluctuations or the probability density functions for fluctuations of those nonstationary times series, or both of them. By this study, we find that small fluctuations have the strong memory and synchronization while big fluctuations possess the weak memory and synchronization, and the Bitcoin market has greater synchronicity than the stock market, and large fluctuations in China financial market are persistent while they are anti-persistent in US market.

TI A Bayesian approach to identify Bitcoin users
SO PLOS ONE
AB Bitcoin is a digital currency and electronic payment system operating over a peer-to-peer network on the Internet. One of its most important properties is the high level of anonymity it provides for its users. The users are identified by their Bitcoin addresses, which are random strings in the public records of transactions, the blockchain. When a user initiates a Bitcoin transaction, his Bitcoin client program relays messages to other clients through the Bitcoin network. Monitoring the propagation of these messages and analyzing them carefully reveal hidden relations. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model using a probabilistic approach to link Bitcoin addresses and transactions to the originator IP address. To utilize our model, we carried out experiments by installing more than a hundred modified Bitcoin clients distributed in the network to observe as many messages as possible. During a two month observation period we were able to identify several thousand Bitcoin clients and bind their transactions to geographical locations.

SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB This article provides a multi-disciplinary overview of the contemporary cybercrime ecosystem and its developments. It does so by reviewing and synthesising recent cybercrime research from fields such as cybersecurity, law and criminology. The article also examines ways in which gaps between the aforementioned fields arise and how to lessen them to increase cybersecurity. This article is divided into four main parts. The first part offers background on cybercrime and some of its main elements. It defines terminology, sets out a legal taxonomy of cybercrime offences and presents the estimated costs, threat agents and characteristics of various illicit activities and technical aspects of cybercrime. Parts two, three and four build on this preceding analysis by (separately) examining three prominent threat vectors within the ecosystem - malware, the darknet and Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For each threat vector, the article identifies and investigates features, history, functions and current and expected states of development within the ecosystem. Through its attention to and synthesis of current research and results from different fields, this article offers a synoptic account of the cybercrime ecosystem, which can bridge potential knowledge gaps between fields.

TI Security in Cyber-Enabled Design and Manufacturing: A Survey
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING
AB Developments in digital technology and manufacturing processes have expanded the horizon of designer innovation in creating products. In addition to this, real-time collaborative platforms help designers shorten the product development cycle by enabling collaborations with domain experts from concept generation to product realization and after-market. These collaborations are extending beyond enterprise and national boundaries, contributing to a growing concern among designers regarding the security of their sensitive information such as intellectual property (IP) and trade secrets. The source of such sensitive information leaks could be external (e.g., hacker) or internal (e.g., disgruntled employee) to the collaboration. From a designer's perspective, this fear can inhibit participation in a collaboration even though it might result in better products or services. In this paper, we aim to contextualize this evolving security space by discussing various security practices in digital domains, such as encryption and secret sharing, as well as manufacturing domains, such as physically unclonable function (PUF) and physical part watermarking for anticounteifeiting and tamper evidence purposes. Further, we classify these practices with respect to their performance against different adversarial models for different stages in product development. Such a classification can help designers to make informed decisions regarding security practices during the product realization process.

TI An Analysis of Bitcoin's Price Dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper aims to enhance the understanding of which factors affect the price development of Bitcoin in order for investors to make sound investment decisions. Previous literature has covered only a small extent of the highly volatile period during the last months of 2017 and the beginning of 2018. To examine the potential price drivers, we use the Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity approach. Our study identifies the technological factor Hashrate as irrelevant for modeling Bitcoin price dynamics. This irrelevance is due to the underlying code that makes the supply of Bitcoins deterministic, and it stands in contrast to previous literature that has included Hashrate as a crucial independent variable. Moreover, the empirical findings indicate that the price of Bitcoin is affected by returns on the S&P 500 and Google searches, showing consistency with results from previous literature. In contrast to previous literature, we find the CBOE volatility index (VIX), oil, gold, and Bitcoin transaction volume to be insignificant.

TI A privacy-preserving Internet of Things device management scheme based
   on blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Blockchain as a new technique has attracted attentions from industry and academics for sharing data across organizations. Many blockchain-based data sharing applications, such as Internet of Things devices management, need privacy-preserving access services over encrypted data with dual capabilities. On one hand, they need to keep the sensitive data private such that others cannot trace and infer sensitive data stored in the block. On the other hand, they need to support fine-grained access control both from time and users' attributes. However, to the best of our knowledge, no blockchain systems can support time-bound and attributes-based access with high efficiency. In this article, we propose a privacy-preserving Internet of Things devices management scheme based on blockchain, which provides efficient time-bound and attribute-based access and supports key automatic revocation. The analysis and experiments show that our scheme is quite efficient and deployable.

TI How infrastructures anchor open entrepreneurship: The case of Bitcoin
   and stigma
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB This paper delves into the question: How does an entrepreneur commercialising an open source technology (an open entrepreneur) respond when an underlying infrastructure that is maintained by a distributed and heterogeneous community become stigmatised, particularly when the source of the stigma is unclear? Research has found that, when faced with stigma, the most effective and robust strategy for established nondigital firms is to try to and create a distance from it. Open entrepreneurs with different ideologies would likely benefit from similar actions; however, the interdependencies created when they rely upon a digital infrastructure may make this strategy impossible. Given the tensions between ideological heterogeneity and a shared infrastructure, howand whydo open entrepreneurs respond to stigma? This paper extends existing literature on stigma by developing a model of ideologically mediated responses to stigma by open entrepreneurs through an inductive study based upon interviews, archival, and forum data. We further contribute to extant literature on open entrepreneurship by proposing a model of ideologically mediated responses to stigma, which is grounded in group identity theory. We also build on digital infrastructure literature by proposing the concept of digital infrastructure anchoring. Lastly, we show how ideological heterogeneity leads to business model heterogeneity among open entrepreneurs and discuss the practical implications of this research.

TI A Blockchain-Based Location Privacy Protection Incentive Mechanism in
   Crowd Sensing Networks
SO SENSORS
AB Crowd sensing is a perception mode that recruits mobile device users to complete tasks such as data collection and cloud computing. For the cloud computing platform, crowd sensing can not only enable users to collaborate to complete large-scale awareness tasks but also provide users for types, social attributes, and other information for the cloud platform. In order to improve the effectiveness of crowd sensing, many incentive mechanisms have been proposed. Common incentives are monetary reward, entertainment & gamification, social relation, and virtual credit. However, there are rare incentives based on privacy protection basically. In this paper, we proposed a mixed incentive mechanism which combined privacy protection and virtual credit called a blockchain-based location privacy protection incentive mechanism in crowd sensing networks. Its network structure can be divided into three parts which are intelligence crowd sensing networks, confusion mechanism, and blockchain. We conducted the experiments in the campus environment and the results shows that the incentive mechanism proposed in this paper has the efficacious effect in stimulating user participation.

TI Data Transmission Scheme Considering Node Failure for Blockchain
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB In recent years, Blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention from the industrial circle. Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology, which must be validated, stored and maintained by all nodes to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. The communication efficiency of Blockchain is an important factor restricting its application. Existing algorithms can provide data routing schemes for Blockchain but without considering the node failure. On Blockchain, node failure is a common phenomenon due to the nodes' selfishness and nodes' mobility. Node failure degrades the network performance or even sometimes makes the network useless. This paper proposes a data transmission scheme considering node failure for finishing validation of block data on Blockchain, which firstly sets response threshold level to detect failure node, and then using greedy idea constructs communication tree to organize all nodes forwarding block data. Based to the multi-link concurrent communication tree model, this scheme maximizes the potential transmitting capacity of nodes and assigns proper tasks to other nodes beside source node, so it can shorten the validation time of Blockchain transaction, and improve resistance to node failure. Theoretical proof and experimental results show the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed data transmission scheme.

TI Revisiting the Risks of Bitcoin Currency Exchange Closure
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
AB Bitcoin has enjoyed wider adoption than any previous cryptocurrency; yet its success has also attracted the attention of fraudsters who have taken advantage of operational insecurity and transaction irreversibility. We study the risk that investors face from the closure of Bitcoin exchanges, which convert between Bitcoins and hard currency. We examine the track record of 80 Bitcoin exchanges established between 2010 and 2015. We find that nearly half (38) have since closed, with customer account balances sometimes wiped out. Fraudsters are sometimes to blame, but not always. Twenty-five exchanges suffered security breaches, 15 of which subsequently closed. We present logistic regressions using longitudinal data on Bitcoin exchanges aggregated quarterly. We find that experiencing a breach is correlated with a 13 times greater odds that an exchange will close in that same quarter. We find that higher-volume exchanges are less likely to close (each doubling in trade volume corresponds to a 12% decrease in the odds of closure). We also find that exchanges that derive most of their business from trading less popular (fiat) currencies, which are offered by at most one competitor, are less likely to close.

TI A survey on essential components of a self-sovereign identity
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE REVIEW
AB This paper provides an overview of the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept, focusing on four different components that we identified as essential to the architecture. Self-Sovereign Identity is enabled by the new development of blockchain technology. Through the trustless, decentralised database that is provided by a blockchain, classic Identity Management registration processes can be replaced.
   We start off by giving a simple overview of blockchain based SSI, introducing an architecture overview as well as relevant actors in such a system. We further distinguish two major approaches, namely the Identifier Registry Model and its extension the Claim Registry Model.
   Subsequently we discuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and current approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko's Triangle. As the user of an SSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication solutions.
   Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that are presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only loosely connected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards to blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology.
   Storage solutions for the verifiable claims, both on- and off-chain, are presented with their advantages and disadvantages. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Differentially Private Data Sharing in a Cloud Federation with
   Blockchain
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
AB Cloud federation is an emergent cloud-computing paradigm that allows services from different cloud systems to be aggregated in a single pool. To support secure data sharing in a cloud federation, anonymization services that obfuscate sensitive datasets under differential privacy have been recently proposed. However, by outsourcing data protection to the cloud, data owners lose control over their data, raising privacy concerns. This is even more compelling in multi-query scenarios in which maintaining privacy amounts to controlling the allocation of the so-called privacy budget. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach that enables data owners to control the anonymization process and that enhances the security of the services. Our approach relies on blockchain to validate the usage of the privacy budget and adaptively change its allocation through smart contracts, depending on the privacy requirements provided by data owners. Prototype implementation with the Hyperledger permissioned blockchain validates our approach with respect to privacy guarantee and practicality.

TI A Study on the Transparent Price Tracing System in Supply Chain
   Management Based on Blockchain
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Over the past few years, the importance of improving the product distribution structure has increased worldwide. Therefore, distribution prices are now disclosed and product information is shared with consumers. However, distribution channels are complex and supply chain management (SCM) is autonomously executed in each company. For this reason, it has been frequently pointed out that the distribution process is not transparent and the distribution margin is high. In this paper, we propose a system that guarantees the transparency of the product distribution structure by applying blockchain and smart contracts to the price-tracking portion of supply chain management systems. This approach allows companies to track their trades by enhancing transparency in the SCM, thereby discouraging companies from pursuing excessive profits. In addition, companies can cut management costs by automatically storing distribution details in a blockchain network and managing information more securely.

TI Decentralized Clearing in Financial Networks
SO MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
AB We consider a situation in which agents have mutual claims on each other, summarized in a liability matrix. Agents' assets might be insufficient to satisfy their liabilities, leading to defaults. In case of default, bankruptcy rules are used to specify the way agents are going to be rationed. A clearing payment matrix is a payment matrix consistent with the prevailing bankruptcy rules that satisfies limited liability and priority of creditors. Since clearing payment matrices and the corresponding values of equity are not uniquely determined, we provide bounds on the possible levels equity can take. Unlike the existing literature, which studies centralized clearing procedures, we introduce a large class of decentralized clearing processes. We show the convergence of any such process in finitely many iterations to the least clearing payment matrix. When the unit of account is sufficiently small, all decentralized clearing processes lead essentially to the same value of equity as a centralized clearing procedure. As a policy implication, it is not necessary to collect and process all the sensitive data of all the agents simultaneously and run a centralized clearing procedure.

AB Minimizing the breach detection gap (BDG) for cyber-attacks is a big concern for all organizations and governments. Cyber-attacks are discovered daily, many of which have gone undetected for days to years before the victim organizations detect and deploy the cyber defense. Cyber defense solutions are advancing to combat risks and attacks from traditional to next-generation advanced defense protection solutions. However, many individuals, organizations and businesses continue to be hit by new waves of global cyber-attacks. In this paper, we present a blockchain-enabled federated cloud computing framework that uses the Dempster-Shafer theory to reduce BDG by continuously monitoring and analyzing the network traffics against cyber-attacks. We evaluate the proposed approach using numerical results, and the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches.

TI Optimal Computational Power Allocation in Multi-Access Mobile Edge
   Computing for Blockchain
SO SENSORS
AB Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and trustable ledger for recording and storing digital transactions. The mining process of Blockchain, however, incurs a heavy computational workload for miners to solve the proof-of-work puzzle (i.e., a series of the hashing computation), which is prohibitive from the perspective of the mobile terminals (MTs). The advanced multi-access mobile edge computing (MEC), which enables the MTs to offload part of the computational workloads (for solving the proof-of-work) to the nearby edge-servers (ESs), provides a promising approach to address this issue. By offloading the computational workloads via multi-access MEC, the MTs can effectively increase their successful probabilities when participating in the mining game and gain the consequent reward (i.e., winning the bitcoin). However, as a compensation to the ESs which provide the computational resources to the MTs, the MTs need to pay the ESs for the corresponding resource-acquisition costs. Thus, to investigate the trade-off between obtaining the computational resources from the ESs (for solving the proof-of-work) and paying for the consequent cost, we formulate an optimization problem in which the MTs determine their acquired computational resources from different ESs, with the objective of maximizing the MTs' social net-reward in the mining process while keeping the fairness among the MTs. In spite of the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we exploit its layered structure and propose efficient distributed algorithms for the MTs to individually determine their optimal computational resources acquired from different ESs. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and the performance of our proposed multi-access MEC for Blockchain.

SO JOURNAL OF NEURO-ONCOLOGY
AB PurposeTo quantify changes and prognostic value of diffusion MRI measurements obtained using mono-exponential, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and stretched exponential (SE) models prior and after chemoradiation in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM).MethodsDiffusion-weighted images (DWIs) were acquired in twenty-three patients following surgery, prior chemoradiation and within 7days following completion of treatment, using b-values ranging from 0 to 5000s/mm(2). Mono-exponential diffusion (apparent diffusion coefficient: ADC), isotropic (non-directional) DKI model with apparent diffusivity (Dapp) and kurtosis (Kapp) estimates as well as SE model with distributed-diffusion coefficient (DDC) and mean intra-voxel heterogeneity () were computed for all patients prior and after chemoradiation. Median values were calculated for normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and contrast-enhancing tumor (CET). The magnitudes of diffusion change prior and after chemoradiation were used to predict overall survival (OS).ResultsDiffusivity in NAWM was consistent for all diffusion measures during chemoradiation, while diffusivity measurements (ADC, Dapp and DDC) within CET changed significantly. A strong positive correlation existed between ADC, Dapp, and DDC measurements prior to chemoradiation; however, this association was weak following chemoradiation, suggesting a more complex microstructural environment after cytotoxic therapy. When combined with baseline tumor volume and MGMT status, age and ADC changes added significant prognostic values, whereas more complex diffusion models did not show significant value in predicting OS.ConclusionsDespite increased tissue complexity following chemoradiation, advanced diffusion models have longer acquisition times, provide largely comparable measures of diffusivity, and do not appear to provide additional prognostic value compared to mono-exponential ADC maps.

TI Building a Community of Users for Open Market Energy
SO ENERGIES
AB Energy markets are based on energy transactions with a central control entity, where the players are companies. In this research work, we propose an IoT (Internet of Things) system for the accounting of energy flows, as well as a blockchain approach to overcome the need for a central control entity. This allows for the creation of local energy markets to handle distributed energy transactions without needing central control. In parallel, the system aggregates users into communities with target goals and creates new markets for players. These two approaches (blockchain and IoT) are brought together using a gamification approach, allowing for the creation and maintenance of a community for electricity market participation based on pre-defined goals. This community approach increases the number of market players and creates the possibility of traditional end users earning money through small coordinated efforts. We apply this approach to the aggregation of batteries from electrical vehicles so that they become a player in the spinning reserve market. It is also possible to apply this approach to local demand flexibility, associated with the demand response (DR) concept. DR is aggregated to allow greater flexibility in the regulation market based on an OpenADR approach that allows the turning on and off of predefined equipment to handle local microgeneration.

This paper designs a novel Food Trading System with COnsortium blockchaiN (FTSCON) to eliminate information asymmetry in the food trade, in order to establish a sustainable and credible trading environment, the system uses consortium blockchain technology to meet the challenge of different authentications and permissions for different roles in food trade. Meanwhile, we have used the online double auction mechanism to eliminate competition. We also have designed a improved Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (iPBFT) algorithm to improve efficiency. In addition, a case study based on a series of data from Shandong Province, China indicate that the FTSCON can achieve profit improvement of merchants. Therefore, the proposed system proved to have high commercial value.

TI IoT Based information and communication system for enhancing underground
   mines safety and productivity: Genesis, taxonomy and open issues
SO AD HOC NETWORKS
AB Underground mining operations require robust and efficient communication like other industrial enterprises. Communication in the mining industry is the most critical factor to ensure the safety and security of the underground working environment. A robust IT communication infrastructure in underground mining will enhance safety and provide information in real-time which can result in a quick response to some fatal situation. Communication technologies that are capable of bearing the rough terrain and extreme environment inside a mine and between the surface and underground workstations is a critical factor for the monitoring of various underground mining operations remotely. Internet of Things (IoT) can play a massive role in the mining operations to improve the safety of the workers with enhanced productivity. Wireless communication, which is a part of IoT setup, is already playing a vital role in underground mine communication (UMC). Recently, IoT with its building blocks has been introduced to deploy and automate the operation of 'self-advancing goaf edge support (SAGES)' systems in an attempt to explore the possibility of the technology for real-time performance monitoring of support system including the behaviour of overlying roof strata in underground coal mines. The machine helps in supporting the roof of the mines during mining the coal. This paper presents a conceptual framework for implementation of IoT to make this underground support system smarter i.e. Smart-SAGES. The taxonomy of security challenges in UMC IoT combination has been described in detail in order to identify clear security goals. The blockchain based system seems to be a promising technology for the mining industry as it may help in curbing the penetration and disruption of cyber-attacks due to heterogeneous devices and distributed network. Various open issues in UMC have also been outlined. Vulnerabilities like information disclosure and Denial-of-Service attack (DoS attack) were discovered during the threat and risk analysis on the SAGES data logger. The SAGES falls into information generation block of IoT ecosystem. Therefore, it is advisable to incorporate the security by design approach from the initial phase of the development. Thus, the data transmission and storage can be made secure. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO PLOS ONE
AB Cryptocurrency is a well-developed blockchain technology application that is currently a heated topic throughout the world. The public availability of transaction histories offers an opportunity to analyze and compare different cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we present a dynamic network analysis of three representative blockchain-based cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Namecoin. By analyzing the accumulated network growth, we find that, unlike most other networks, these cryptocurrency networks do not always densify over time, and they are changing all the time with relatively low node and edge repetition ratios. Therefore, we then construct separate networks on a monthly basis, trace the changes of typical network characteristics (including degree distribution, degree assortativity, clustering coefficient, and the largest connected component) over time, and compare the three. We find that the degree distribution of these monthly transaction networks cannot be well fitted by the famous power-law distribution, at the same time, different currency still has different network properties, e.g., both Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are heavy-tailed with disassortative mixing, however, only the former can be treated as a small world. These network properties reflect the evolutionary characteristics and competitive power of these three cryptocurrencies and provide a foundation for future research.

TI Scalable funding of Bitcoin micropayment channel networks
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB The Bitcoin network has scalability problems. To increase its transaction rate and speed, micropayment channel networks have been proposed; however, these require to lock funds into specific channels. Moreover, the available space in the blockchain does not allow scaling to a worldwide payment system. We propose a new layer that sits in between the blockchain and the payment channels. The new layer addresses the scalability problem by enabling trustless off-blockchain channel funding. It consists of shared accounts of groups of nodes that flexibly create one-to-one channels for the payment network. The new system allows rapid changes of the allocation of funds to channels and reduces the cost of opening new channels. Instead of one blockchain transaction per channel, each user only needs one transaction to enter a group of nodes-within the group the user can create arbitrarily many channels. For a group of 20 users with 100 intra-group channels, the cost of the blockchain transactions is reduced by 90% compared to 100 regular micropayment channels opened on the blockchain. This can be increased further to 96% if Bitcoin introduces Schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.

TI Proof of Kernel Work: a democratic low-energy consensus for distributed
   access-control protocols
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB We adjust the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism used in Bitcoin and Ethereum so that we can build on its strength while also addressing, in part, some of its perceived weaknesses. Notably, our work ismotivated by the high energy consumption for mining PoW, and we want to restrict the use of PoW to a configurable, expected size of nodes, as a function of the local blockchain state. The approach we develop for this rests on three pillars: (i) Proof of Kernel Work (PoKW), a means of dynamically reducing the set of nodes that can participate in the solving of PoW puzzles such that an adversary cannot increase his attack surface because of such a reduction; (ii) Practical Adaptation of Existing Technology, a realization of this PoW reduction through an adaptation of existing blockchain and enterprise technology stacks; and (iii) Machine Learning for Adaptive System Resiliency, the use of techniques from artificial intelligence to make our approach adaptive to system, network and attack dynamics. We develop here, in detail, the first pillar and illustrate the second pillar through a real use case, a pilot project done with Porsche on controlling permissions to vehicle and data log accesses. We also discuss pertinent attack vectors for PoKW consensus and their mitigation. Moreover, we sketch how our approach may lead to more democratic PoKW-based blockchain systems for public networks that may inherit the resilience of blockchains based on PoW.

TI Blockchain and law: Incompatible codes?
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB Blockchain has recently joined a long line of technological innovations that have been characterised as disruptive to, and possibly even subversive of, fundamental legal principles. This article looks behind the hype to examine how blockchain might - or might not - be compatible with established legal and regulatory models. Data protection is discussed as an example of an area of law that some have claimed cannot be reconciled with blockchain. Various other conflicts are also identified and concerns about blockchain are placed in the context of wider historical debates about new technologies vs law. (C) 2018 Christopher Millard.

AB Gibraltar foundations have attracted a lot of interest in the charitable and financial services areas, most notably in the distributed ledger (or block-chain) technology (DLT) and initial coin offering space. Gibraltar is one of the first jurisdictions to embrace DLT technology and the financial services activity it has generated, whilst recognizing the risks inherent in those activities and moving to legislate against them. Given the combination of the interest recently generated in these areas, and the suitability of the Gibraltar foundation as a vehicle through which to engage in these activities, it is of little surprise that Gibraltar foundations are attracting an increasing amount of attention and interest.

TI Timing Error Prediction AVFS With Detection Window Tuning for
   Wide-Operating-Range ICs
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS
AB In-situ timing monitoring-based adaptive voltage frequency scaling (AVFS) is effective in eliminating the timing margin. However, for wide-operating-range applications, one big challenge is that severe process, voltage, and temperature variations causes varying need for detection window. Therefore, a timing error prediction based AVFS method is proposed with on-chip detection window tuning to solve this problem. In addition, to cope with the area overhead problem, an activation-oriented monitoring paths selection method is proposed to decrease the insertion rate. Implemented on a 45-nm CMOS Bitcoin miner chip working across 0.6 V-1.1 V, it increases the throughput by 190.8%, 83.3%, 67.9%, and 25.4% at 0.6 V, 0.72 V, 0.9 V, and 1.1 V, respectively, for a typical die at 25 degrees C, compared to baseline frequencies. Measurement results demonstrate that our AVFS system is suitable for wide-operating-range applications.

TI Blockchain-based decentralized content trust for docker images
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB It is feasible to deploy Docker containers in IoT (Internet of Things) devices because their runtime overhead is almost zero. Default Docker installation does not verify an image authenticity. Authentication is vital for users to trust that the image is not malicious or tampered with. As Docker is currently a popular choice for developers, tightening its security is a priority for system administrators and DevOps engineers. Docker recently deployed Notary as a solution to verify authenticity of their images. Notary is a viable solution, but it has some potential threats. This paper specifically addresses its vulnerability towards Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and propose a potential solution: blockchain-based Decentralized Docker Trust (DDT). The proposed solution involves decentralizing the trust via a blockchain. The solution greatly reduces the risk of DoS and at the same time provides a signature verification service for Docker images. We demonstrate the proposed blockchain-based solution's scalability and efficiency by conducting performance evaluation. At the same time, we also implemented a system prototype of Decentralized Docker Trust (DDT), and conducted performance evaluation for it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) across multiple data centers.

TI Copolymer P(BS-co-LA) Enhanced Compatibility of PBS/PLA Composite
SO JOURNAL OF POLYMERS AND THE ENVIRONMENT
AB The copolymer P(BS-co-LA) with various block chains are synthesized and employed as the interface linker in poly(butyl succinate) (PBS)/polylactic acid (PLA) blends to enhance the compatibility of PBS and PLA. The crystallization and rheological properties are determined by various methods, as well as the mechanical properties. The results indicate that the addition of P(BS-co-LA) decreases the crystallization temperature and degree of crystallinity in the PBS/PLA composite. The P(BS-co-LA) with a long-block chain remarkably enhances the compatibility of PBS/PLA composites than short block chains, and the PBS/PLA/P(BS-hb-LA) composites show great elongation at break and impact strength. Besides, the crystallinity and the rate of crystallization are increased, which are also observed by the X-ray diffraction. All approaches lead to the same result that P(BS-co-LA) with the long block chain is an excellent compatibility agent to enhance mechanical properties of the PBS/PLA composites.

TI Google matrix of Bitcoin network
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
AB We construct and study the Google matrix of Bitcoin transactions during the time period from the very beginning in 2009 till April 2013. The Bitcoin network has up to a few millions of bitcoin users and we present its main characteristics including the PageRank and CheiRank probability distributions, the spectrum of eigenvalues of Google matrix and related eigenvectors. We find that the spectrum has an unusual circle-type structure which we attribute to existing hidden communities of nodes linked between their members. We show that the Gini coefficient of the transactions for the whole period is close to unity showing that the main part of wealth of the network is captured by a small fraction of users. In global the Google matrix analysis of bitcoin network gives a new understanding of the bitcoin transactions with PageRank and CheiRank characterization of sellers and buyers which are dominant not simply due to the sold/bought volume but also by taking into account if bitcoins are sold to (bought by) other important sellers (buyers).

TI Current trends, concerns and peculiarities of the turnover of
   cryptocurrency
SO ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB Sponsorship of international terrorism and transnational criminal activity poses a significant threat to the financial system, and due to the rapid expansion of payment opportunities in the Internet, risks have increased significantly, which requires a study of foreign legal experience and the development of a law enforcement strategy to control the circulation of the cryptocurrency.
   The authors have come to the following conclusions. The use of cryptocurrencies is a promising way to maintain economic development by applying modern accounting and information technologies. International experience clearly demonstrates the importance and role of cryptocurrencies in the activities of transnational criminal groups relating to the financing of terrorism and human trafficking. In the context of globalisation and implementation of the European integration in Ukraine, the turnover of cryptocurrencies needs to be regulated at the legislative level. Thus, it is necessary to accelerate the approval of the Draft Law "On the turnover of cryptocurrency in Ukraine" No. 7183 as of 06 October 2017. It is advisable to introduce a system of registration (licencing) of crypto-currency exchange and exchangers at the national level. At the same time, it is necessary to impose an obligation on cryptoexchangers to collect information about customers. Also, it is necessary to regulate activities of companies that sell goods and services to customers for cryptocurrency, as it is accepted by PayPal, Braintree and other payment systems.

Daily returns of 6 major crypto-currencies and market index CCI30 for the period 07-08-2015 t0 18-01-2018 is used. Possibility of herding under up and down market and high and low volatility is tested. Herding is found under up and down market activity, indicating over-enthusiasm and over-reaction. Market volatility is found not to have any significant impact on herding behavior. Herding is found to be dependent upon the market activity rather than market volatility.

TI Applying Blockchain Technology: Evidence from Norwegian Companies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The aim of this study is to develop a theoretical framework for blockchain, operations in particular. Furthermore, we aim to identify the main drivers and barriers of digital innovation and explore the general possibilities of blockchain applications within the maritime industry. A case study approach is applied: the Norwegian offshore industry. Primary data is collected through interviews, while secondary data is collected from industrial and company reports, the Internet, and national and international media reports. We have discovered that cost reduction intentions, the high level of regulation in the maritime industry, and the large amount of data that maritime companies should process, along with the intention to work more effectively, are the main drivers of digital innovation. On the other hand, the high cost of implementation, the bad quality of Internet connections offshore, the old age of decision-makers, the technology-oriented culture, the lack of investment initiatives, the low level of blockchain diffusion through the supply chain, and risk aversion are the main barriers. The results of the qualitative study show that some of the barriers and motives of digital innovation and the introduction to blockchain technology were pointed out by earlier studies. However, we have identified several unique drivers and barriers specific to the industry. Finally, the blockchain process framework is developed.

TI Beyond BitCoin-legal impurities and off-chain assets
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Blockchain technology allows the creation of distributed ledgers. These distribute control among the players rather than requiring a centralized database, and so can reduce costs and speed-up transactions. However, when it is used for assets which exist outside the blockchain itself, an unmodified adoption of the technology would bypass legal and regulatory requirements which, for these kinds of assets, cannot be bypassed without fundamental change to the law.
   Building those requirements into any blockchain-based system introduces features which are not necessary for performing its core functions, and we call these 'legal impurities'. The most important legal impurities required are those relating to identification of the parties, and introducing the ability of a trusted third party to make modifications to the ledger. Not only does introducing these legal impurities make fundamental changes to the concept behind blockchain, but it is also essential that they are implemented in ways which do not threaten the integrity of the blockchain as evidence.
   This article has been produced by members of the Microsoft Cloud Computing Research Centre, a collaboration between the Cloud Legal Project, Centre for Commercial Law Studies, Queen Mary University of London and the Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge.

TI Postprandial Glycaemic Responses of Dried Fruit-Containing Meals in
   Healthy Adults: Results from a Randomised Trial
SO NUTRIENTS
AB The aim of this study was to explore the glycaemic response (GR) patterns of four dried fruits (DF) and the mixed meals containing dried fruits, rice and almonds. Dried apples (DApp), dried jujubes (DJ), raisins (Ra) and dried apricots (DApr) were tested in eleven healthy subjects in random order. Test meals included the following 3 groups: (1) dried fruits containing 50 g available carbohydrates; (2) mixed meals consisting of DF and rice (DF + R), each contributing 25 g available carbohydrates; (3) Group (2) supplemented with 30 g almonds (DF + R + A). The postprandial GR and other characteristics in 240 min were investigated. The GI values of 4 DFs were 43 for DApp, 55 for DJ, 56 for both Ra and DApr. The DApp displayed the smallest amplitude of glycaemic excursion within 240 min (MAGE(0-240)). Compared with rice, the DApp + R meal elicited a significantly reduced GR and a smaller MAGE(0-240) (GI 81 vs. 65). With the addition of almonds, the GIs and MAGE(0-240) decreased significantly in all DF + A + R combinations except DApp + R + A. The ratio of total fructose/glucose contents of test meals were negatively correlated to GIs. Dried fruits and nuts may have the potential to mitigate the postprandial GR when jointly introduced into glycaemic management diets.

TI Toward a Charged Homo[2]catenane Employing Diazaperopyrenium Homophilic
   Recognition
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
AB An octacationic diazaperopyrenium (DAPP(2+))-based homo[2]catenane (DAPPHC(8+)), wherein no fewer than eight positive charges are associated within a mechanically interlocked molecule, has been produced in 30% yield under ambient conditions as a result of favorable homophilic interactions, reflecting a delicate balance between strong pi-pi interactions and the destabilizing penalty arising from Coulombic repulsions between DAPP(2+) units. This DAPPHC(8+) catenane is composed of two identical mechanically interlocked tetracationic cyclophanes, namely DAPPBox(4+), each of which contains one DAPP(2+) unit and one extended viologen (ExBIPY(2+) unit, linked together by two p-xylylene bridges. The solid-state structure of the homo[2]catenane demonstrates how homophilic interactions play an important role in the formation of DAPPHC(8+), in which the mean ring planes of the two DAPPBox(4+) cyclophanes are oriented at about 60 with respect to each other, with a centroid-to-centroid separation of 3.7 angstrom between the mean planes of the outer ExBIPY(2+) and inner DAPP(2+) units, and 3.6 angstrom between the mean planes of the two inner DAPP(2+) units. We show that irradiation of the DAPPHC(8+) catenane at 330 nm in acetonitrile solution results in simultaneous energy and electron transfer. The latter occurs from the inner DAPP(2+) dimer to the outer ExBIPY(2+) unit, leading to the generation of a temporary charge-separated state within a rigid and robust homo[2]catenane. Compared to DAPPBox(4+), both forward- and back-electron transfer in DAPPHC(8+) occur with faster rates, owing to the closer proximity between the electron donor and acceptor in the homo[2]catenane than in the separated cyclophane.

TI Multiple Authorities Attribute-Based Verification Mechanism for
   Blockchain Mircogrid Transactions
SO ENERGIES
AB Recently, advancements in energy distribution models have fulfilled the needs of microgrids in finding a suitable energy distribution model between producer and consumer without the need of central controlling authority. Most of the energy distribution model deals with energy transactions and losses without considering the security aspects such as information tampering. The transaction data could be accessible online to keep track of the energy distribution between the consumer and producer (e.g., online payment records and supplier profiles). However this data is prone to modification and misuse if a consumer moves from one producer to other. Blockchain is considered to be one solution to allow users to exchange energy related data and keep track of it without exposing it to modification. In this paper, electrical transactions embedded in blockchain are validated using the signatures of multiple producers based on their assigned attributes. These signatures are verified and endorsed by the consumers satisfying those attributes without revealing any information. The public and private keys for these consumers are generated by the producers and endorsement procedure using these keys ensures that these consumers are authorized. This approach does not need any central authority. To resist against collision attacks, producers are given a secret pseudorandom function seed. The comparative analysis shows the efficiency of proposed approach over the existing ones.

   Materials and Methods: Between December 2014 and April 2016, we retrospectively enrolled 72 consecutive patients with head and neck masses who had undergone RS-EPI-based DKI scan (b value of 0, 500, 1000, and 1500 s/mm(2)) for pretreatment evaluation. Imaging data were post-processed by using monoexponential and diffusion kurtosis (DK) model for quantitation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), apparent diffusion for Gaussian distribution (D-app), and apparent kurtosis coefficient (K-app). Unpaired t test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare differences of quantitative parameters between malignant and benign groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed to determine and compare the diagnostic ability of quantitative parameters in predicting malignancy.
   Results: Malignant group demonstrated significantly lower ADC (0.754 +/- 0.167 vs. 1.222 +/- 0.420, p < 0.001) and Dapp (1.029 +/- 0.226 vs. 1.640 +/- 0.445, p < 0.001) while higher Kapp (1.344 +/- 0.309 vs. 0.715 +/- 0.249, p < 0.001) than benign group. Using a combination of Dapp and Kapp as diagnostic index, significantly better differentiating performance was achieved than using ADC alone (area under curve: 0.956 vs. 0.876, p = 0.042).
   Conclusion: Compared to DWI, DKI could provide additional data related to tumor heterogeneity with significantly better differentiating performance. Its derived quantitative metrics could serve as a promising imaging biomarker for differentiating malignant from benign masses in head and neck region.

TI Lightweight and Manageable Digital Evidence Preservation System on
   Bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB An effective and secure system used for evidence preservation is essential to possess the properties of anti-loss, anti-forgery, anti-tamper and perfect verifiability. Traditional architecture which relies on centralized cloud storage is depressingly beset by the security problems such as incomplete confidence and unreliable regulation. Moreover, an expensive, inefficient and incompatible design impedes the effort of evidence preservation. In contrast, the decentralized blockchain network is qualified as a perfect replacement for its secure anonymity, irrevocable commitment, and transparent traceability. Combining with subliminal channels in blockchain, we have weaved the transaction network with newly designed evidence audit network. In this paper, we have presented and implemented a lightweight digital evidence-preservation architecture which possesses the features of privacy-anonymity, audit-transparency, function-scalability and operation-lightweight. The anonymity is naturally formed from the cryptographic design, since the cipher evidence under encrypted cryptosystem and hash-based functions leakages nothing to the public. Covert channels are efficiently excavated to optimize the cost, connectivity and security of the framework, transforming the great computation power of Bitcoin network to the value of credit. The transparency used for audit, which relates to the proof of existence, comes from instant timestamps and irreversible hash functions in mature blockchain network. The scalability is represented by the evidence chain interacted with the original blockchain, and the extended chains on top of mainchain will cover the most of auditors in different institutions. And the lightweight, which is equal to low-cost, is derived from our fine-grained hierarchical services. At last, analyses of efficiency, security, and availability have shown the complete accomplishment of our system.

AB The goal of the paper is to provide a vague summary of currently existing blockchain use cases in the information technology industry. Respective use cases have been examined in already existing scientific papers, Master Theses, industry white papers and blogs of industry experts. The paper also contains a description of blockchain main technological aspects and working principles, which allows making the assessment of the presented use cases. For each use case respective companies or organisations are added that are applying or testing the given solution. Due to research limitations the paper should not be considered an exhaustive blockchain use case description.
   The paper also provides short introduction into a feasibility analysis of specific blockchain use case. The authors describe the basic steps of potential idea evaluation with regards to blockchain main aspects. It helps understand the necessity for development of a detailed blockchain feasibility model.

TI Smart contracts in Spain; the regulation of smart contracts
SO REVISTA DE DERECHO CIVIL
AB Smart contracts are a reality that has been applied for decades, although they have gained relevance due to the discovery of the blockchain. Both the smart contracts that are executed according to said technology and those which take place outside of it, respond essentially to the same scheme: they are code sequences which express or implement existing agreements that can produce legal effects whose essential feature is that they are self-executable autonomously. This paper is dedicated to the study of the legal challenges that arise from smart contracts executed outside the blockchain; in particular, to whether or not they are contracts, to their making process, to the incidence that the error has on them, to their proof in the judicial procedure, as well as to some aspects related to payment. In order to get a full understanding of smart contracts, their meaning, their historical origin, their operation, their advantages and their difficulties will be also analyzed.

TI Blockchain Tracking and Cannabis Regulation: Developing a permissioned
   blockchain network to track Canada's cannabis supply chain
SO DALHOUSIE JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY MANAGEMENT
AB Achieving the government's goals for cannabis regulation requires legal cannabis to be a cheaper, more attractive consumer alternative compared to the illegal market. This goal may be undermined by the costs and disadvantages of traditional regulatory management.
   A Canada wide, real-time blockchain tracking system appears to be a viable technical solution architecture.
   A permissioned blockchain network could be tested alongside traditional tracking. This investment, if proven effective, could reduce regulatory costs for government and red tape for business, helping to achieve Governments' objectives to:
   1. Enhance public safety by ensuring quality and monitoring product sales
   2. Undermine illegal markets to reduce crime and prevent product diversion.

TI Algorithmic Dispute Resolution-The Automation of Professional Dispute
   Resolution Using AI and Blockchain Technologies
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Legal Services industries are entering a period of major disruption caused by new legal technologies (LawTech), such as artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain. An area already undergoing major innovation is alternative dispute resolution (Alternative Dispute Resolution (2017) Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_dispute_resolution), especially automated online dispute resolution (Online Dispute Resolution (2017) Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_dispute_resolution; Katsh, E. and Rifkin, J. (2001) Online Dispute Resolution: Resolving Conflicts in Cyberspace. Jossey-Bass Wiley, New Jersey).
   In terms of LawTech, we broadly divide online dispute resolution into (a) Consumer ODR-uses technology to facilitate the resolution of disputes between ecommerce parties, typically online suppliers and consumers; (b) Judicial ODR-covers any means of settling 'ordinary' disputes where there is a hearing (using technology) but outside of the courtroom, such as divorce or personal injury cases; and what we refer to as (c) Corporate ODR-the use of technology to manage the resolution of any contractual disputes that may emerge from major multi-partner projects or financial transactions.
   This paper focuses on ODR and specifically the future use of automating anticipatory Corporate dispute resolution using AI and blockchain technologies. The paper describes the legal sector, and how it is being radically transformed by computer science.

TI An optimized blockchain solution for the IBM z14
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Blockchain is a technology that has been available for several years and has already had several generations. Multiple implementations exist. In this paper, we describe how one of them, the Hyperledger Fabric, is used today to demonstrate the wide usage of the technology for multiple markets beyond finance and cryptocurrency. The use cases highlight the relevance of security-due to the type of data and the distributed foundation of blockchain-and of system performance to enable the use cases in production. Security and performance are the base for the architecture of blockchain on the IBM LinuxONE systems. The Secure Service Container prevents tampering, and the cryptocard usage hardens the solution-and the performance optimization in the compiler, cryptoinstructions, and large caches provides the performance. These optimizations have been further extended with the IBM z14 beyond previous IBM Z generations. In this paper, we describe how a cluster topology is used to implement a high-availability service that scales dynamically from small networks to large ones using the hot plug capabilities of the IBM LinuxONE systems.

TI In digital we trust: Bitcoin discourse, digital currencies, and
   decentralized network fetishism
SO PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS
AB This paper outlines how the digital currency and network technology of bitcoin functions and explores the context from which it emerged. Bitcoin was conceived in 2008 as an attempt to alleviate trust in government and banks which was at a low during this period of financial crisis. However, with bitcoin trust does not dissipate, rather it shifts. Trust moves from trust in banks or states to trust in algorithms and encryption software. There is a move from conventional trust in the gold standard-"In Gold We Trust"-to the trust announced on U.S. currency-"In God We Trust"-to trust in software and networks-" In Digital We Trust". The hyperbole of bitcoin discourse is deemed to be an expression of the Californian Ideology, which itself often conceals a right-wing agenda. The paper analyses the hype behind the celebration of decentralised digital networks. It proposes that a form of network fetishism operates here. The failure of bitcoin as a currency (rather than as a hoarded commodity in an emergent bubble) and as an idea might be attributed to the failure to see how ultra-modern digital networks conceal very traditional consolidation of power and capital. The rise and fall of bitcoin, in terms of its original ambition, serves as a cautionary tale in the digital age-it reveals how ingenious innovations that might challenge power and the consolidation of capital become co-opted and colonised by capital. Finally, the paper offers a discussion of the possible progressive uses of the digital technology bitcoin has facilitated.

TI The many faces of personality: The DSM-5 dimensional and categorical
   models and the five-factor model
SO PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB The classical nosographical approach to personality disorders leads to a set of categories that may be considered to be both conceptually and empirically problematic. In this regard, the DSM-5 includes an alternative dimensional model for which the Personality Inventory Disorders (PID-5) has been developed. Our study compares this alternative dimensional model in regards to both personality disorder categories and normal personality dimensions. The 537 participants in our study, 65.4% of whom were women, completed both the PID-5 and the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE) screening questionnaire. Among these participants, 273 participants (64.1% women) also completed the revised version of the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI-R). A multiple factor analysis indicated that two higher-order principal dimensions described the relationships between the PID-5 and both the IPDE and the NEO-FFI-R. These relationships were analyzed in greater detail using a Principal Axis Factor Analysis. Five and four, respectively, intercorrelated lower-level factors were considered after a parallel analysis that confirmed to a certain extent that normal and abnormal personalities share a common underlying structure. Finally, a multiple regression bootstrap series confirmed the close associations between the PID-5 and both the IPDE and the NEO-FFI-R scales. Our results indicate that the PID-5 offers an alternative perspective for describing symptom syndromes with personality pathology.

AB The public blockchain was originally conceived to process monetary transactions in a peer-to-peer network while preventing double-spending. It has since been extended to numerous other applications including execution of programs that exist on the blockchain called "smart contracts." Smart contracts have a major limitation, namely they only operate on data that is on the blockchain. Trusted entities called oracles attest to external data in order to bring it onto the blockchain but they do so without the robust security guarantees that blockchains generally provide. This has the potential to turn oracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper introduces ASTRAEA, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides the truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and certifiers. Voters play a low-risk/low-reward role that is resistant to adversarial manipulation while certifiers play a high-risk/high-reward role so they are required to play with a high degree of accuracy. This paper also presents a formal analysis of the parameters behind the system to measure the probability of an adversary with bounded funds being able to successfully manipulate the oracle's decision, that shows that the same parameters can be set to make manipulation arbitrarily difficult-a desirable feature for the system. Further, this analysis demonstrates that under those conditions a Nash equilibrium exists where all rational players are forced to behave honestly.

AB In this fast pacing world of modernisation, people are moving ahead at the expense of affecting the society cataclysmically and making the people more standoffish and aloof. Some people are becoming too competitive to earn money while others have no clue how about getting even a penny. But at the same time, there exist people who wish to contribute to the society out of altruism. But the existing centralised systems and brokers for charities are so corrupt that people lose belief in these trustless systems and hence the charities become futile. What if we can use the rapacious ideology of money minded people coupled with the modern technology to make the charity system more effective and trustful. Using an approach of decentralisation, cryptocurrency and finance for donations, the system of charity can be improved to a great extent with the added advantage of the involvement of even these people in a conducive way. We propose a system, backed by cryptocurrency transactions, to make the system of charity more transparent and trustworthy where the charity (in form of work) by individuals or organizations is done first and then that work can be sold later as a stock (here we call it a certificate). This will work in a manner similar to the exchange market using crypto-currency. So, people can raise money out of it, just like stocks but finally the money would go to the charities, as the certificates can only be generated by the charity doers. The complete system will be decentralised using Blockchain Technology, Smart Contracts([2]) and Cryptocurrency. This system would facilitate any individual to contribute independently to the society using his time and abilities apart from just money, and ultimately this will lead to an increase in hands towards the amelioration of the society

AB Transparency is crucial in security-critical applications that rely on authoritative information, as it provides a robust mechanism for holding these authorities accountable for their actions. A number of solutions have emerged in recent years that provide transparency in the setting of certificate issuance, and Bitcoin provides an example of how to enforce transparency in a financial setting. In this work we shift to a new setting, the distribution of software package binaries, and present a system for so-called "binary transparency." Our solution, Contour, uses proactive methods for providing transparency, privacy, and availability, even in the face of persistent man-in-the-middle attacks. We also demonstrate, via benchmarks and a test deployment for the Debian software repository, that Contour is the only system for binary transparency that satisfies the efficiency and coordination requirements that would make it possible to deploy today.

AB The state-of-the-art approaches for tracking data provenance on high-performance computing (HPC) systems are either supported by file systems or relational databases. These techniques shared the same critique on the provenance data's fidelity and the associated I/O overhead. This paper envisions to track the HPC data provenance using a distributed inmemory ledger-the core technique leveraged by blockchains and proven to be highly trustworthy by many large-scale applications. We pinpoint two system challenges-storage architecture and consensus protocol-for adopting blockchains to HPC and make the following contributions: (i) We design a new in-memory blockchain architecture for HPC systems, exploiting the high-performance network infrastructure InfiniBand and greatly reducing the I/O overhead; and (ii) We develop a new consensus protocol, namely proof-of-reproducibility (PoR), crafted for the new architecture, which takes into account both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms. The correctness of PoR is both theoretically proven and experimentally verified. A prototype system is implemented and evaluated with more than one million transactions, showing 32x speedup compared to the filesystem-based provenance service and four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the database-based provenance service.

AB Crypto-Ransomware exploits cryptography to hijack personal files and documents and hold them to ransom. Utilizing such technological leap, crypto-ransomware targets a wide range of systems, and platforms. Although many users, whether individuals or organizations, practice proactive security procedures like regular backup, advanced crypto-ransomware can bypass these countermeasures rendering the valuable data vulnerable to such extortion attack. Due to the irreversible nature of its damage, thwarting crypto-ransomware becomes challenging. Although several studies have been conducted to tackle crypto-ransomware detection problem, most of them dealt with it from malware perspective. Such approach has deemed ineffective given the unique characteristics that distinguish this attack which necessitate the early discovery before encryption takes place. To this end, this paper puts forward an efficient and effective framework for building crypto-ransomware early detection models that protect users, whether individuals or organizations, of being victimized by such attack.

IoTChain consists of two components, an authorization blockchain based on the ACE framework and the OSCAR object security model, extended with a group key scheme. The blockchain provides a flexible and trustless way to handle authorization while OSCAR uses the public ledger to set up multicast groups for authorized clients.
   To evaluate the feasibility of our architecture, we have implemented the authorization blockchain on top of a private Ethereum network. We report on several experiments that assess the performance of different architecture components.

AB This paper proposes energy scheduling mechanism that establishes competitive market among multiple prosumer microgrids. Prosumers based on the their role will be able to acquire production points (PP) for being a seller or consumption points (CP) for buying energy in the market. Contributions of each individual microgrid are recorded by noval contribution metric (CM) concept. Transactive energy is scheduled in such way that prosumers with higher CM will benefit more, thereby encouraging network users to contribute more and consume less energy. Truthful bidding principle of Vickrey auction is applied to prevent overbidding and underbidding to maintain market in fair state. Blockchain was used to enhance trust between prosumers and shift the market to decentralized state. Strategies to integrate Locational Marginal Pricings (LMPs) into the system were proposed in the paper. The system was simulated using 5 microgrids in IEEE37-bus feeder. Results showed effectiveness of CM based mechanism to manage energy scheduling.

AB Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned ledger platform designed to be highly modular and extensible, delivering confidentiality, privacy and scalability to enterprise blockchains. With Fabric's production grade availability in mid-2017, enterprises are experimenting with Fabric for building real-world blockchain applications.
   In this paper, we characterize the performance and scalability features of the current production release of Fabric (v1.0). This paper takes an experimental approach, where we study the throughput and latency characteristics of Fabric by subjecting it to different sets of workloads. Through a suite of micro-benchmarks, custom-built for Fabric, we tune different transaction and chaincode parameters and study how they affect transaction latencies. Finally, we also conduct experiments to study Fabric's performance characteristics while increasing the number of chaincodes, channels and peers.

AB The network-centric world of the 21st century and explosive growth of the internet related technologies brought modern cybersecurity culture with complex threat landscape in the Higher Education environment. Cybersecurity landscape is always changing and education providers often do not have remit or in fact the means and capacity to cover the range of activities learners engage with, which attest their achievements, knowledge, and skills. Currently the awarding and validation of qualifications occurs exclusively under centralised management of an education institution or an employer take more ownership of the learning experience and its outcomes without compromising on safety, security, and accessibility. The centralised model of the present awarding and validation is no longer sustainable because learning happens increasingly on online platforms, and learning is far more international than it used to be. Key higher educational providers introduced degree apprenticeships which are new way to 'do both' higher level skills and provide progression routes to improve their employability prospects.
   The 'Blockchain' (BC) facilitates digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. It embraces a set of inter-related technologies. This paper expounds a novel BC-based architecture for transform centralised model of awarding and validation in to decentralized ledger of secured database. This database is shared, replicated, and synchronized for validation among the universities, partner institutions, professionals, statutory or regulatory bodies and industry bodies across the internet. The architecture offers secured collaborative validating system by qualification exchange with BC using trust methods within the decentralized topology.

AB Soon after its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has been adopted by cyber-criminals, which rely on its pseudonymity to implement virtually untraceable scams. One of the typical scams that operate on Bitcoin are the so-called Ponzi schemes. These are fraudulent investments which repay users with the funds invested by new users that join the scheme, and implode when it is no longer possible to find new investments. Despite being illegal in many countries, Ponzi schemes are now proliferating on Bitcoin, and they keep alluring new victims, who are plundered of millions of dollars. We apply data mining techniques to detect Bitcoin addresses related to Ponzi schemes. Our starting point is a dataset of features of real-world Ponzi schemes, that we construct by analysing, on the Bitcoin blockchain, the transactions used to perform the scams. We use this dataset to experiment with various machine learning algorithms, and we assess their effectiveness through standard validation protocols and performance metrics. The best of the classifiers we have experimented can identify most of the Ponzi schemes in the dataset, with a low number of false positives.

AB Recently, there has been a growing interest in using online technologies to design protocols for secure electronic voting. The main challenges include vote privacy and anonymity, ballot irrevocability and transparency throughout the vote counting process. The introduction of the blockchain as a basis for cryptocurrency protocols, provides for the exploitation of the immutability and transparency properties of these distributed ledgers.
   In this paper, we discuss possible uses of the blockchain technology to implement a secure and fair voting system. In particular, we introduce a secret share-based voting system on the blockchain, the so-called SHARVOT protocol(1). Our solution uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to enable on-chain, i.e. within the transactions script, votes submission and winning candidate determination. The protocol is also using a shuffling technique, Circle Shuffle, to de-link voters from their submissions.

AB In recent years, the rapid development of Cloud, Edge and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has accelerated the advancement trends forcing applications and information systems (IS) to evolve. In this new ecosystem, ISs are federated and usually highly distributed becoming complex and very dynamic that have to extend not only through the Cloud/Edge and IoT layers but also the federated organizational boundaries. In this context, Osmotic Computing (OC) is a new paradigm driven by the significant increase in capacity /capability of resources in highly distributed and federated environments, that solves problems related to the deployment, networking and security of microservices called MicroElements (MEL) that are composed and interconnected over Cloud/Edge and IoT infrastructures with specified levels of QoS and security constraints. In this federated collaborative system, each organization needs to have proper administration and security policies to maintain data security while allowing selective sharing of resources. Classical models of access control are not effective in protecting resources while allowing users to access to the resources within their privileges. Blockchain is an underlying technology that could help organizations to improve access control systems through consensus mechanisms, and underlying features of immutability, transparency, auditability, and cryptography. In this work, we propose a MELs orchestration approach through a Software Defined Membrane (SDMem) that leverages Blockchain facilities obeying the osmosis principles.

SO JOURNAL OF GEMMOLOGY
AB Recent developments have brought due diligence, along with tracking and traceability,to the forefront of discussions and requirements in the diamond, coloured stone and pearl industries. This is a result of consumer demands for detailed information on the provenance of gems, banking requirements aiming to reduce risk, industry and company initiatives seeking to bring greater transparency, and ;rowing government legislation on mineral supply chains. To address this trend, certification mechanisms and technologies (such as blockchain) are being developed to solve inherent traceability challenges. As applied to gems, such standards and associated technology could benefit from the support of existing gemmological approaches (e.g. geographical origin determination) to enhance traceability Ind transparency measures. Recent initiatives are not just limited to corporate social responsibility reporting and due diligence requirements, but they also embrace supply chain management ',including quality control and process improvements) -for example, to correctly identify and disclose treated and synthetic materials throughout the jewellery industry-as well as address consumer demand for provenance information. This article provides an overview of current trends and developments in the tracking and traceability of gems, along with an explanation of the terms Bed in this context.

AB The popularity and applicability of mobile crowdsensing applications are continuously increasing due to the widespread of mobile devices and their sensing and processing capabilities. However, we need to offer appropriate incentives to the mobile users who contribute their resources and preserve their privacy. Blockchain technologies enable semi-anonymous multi-party interactions and can be utilized in crowdsensing applications to maintain the privacy of the mobile users while ensuring first-rate crowdsensed data. In this work, we propose to use blockchain technologies and smart contracts to orchestrate the interactions between mobile crowdsensing providers and mobile users for the case of spatial crowdsensing, where mobile users need to be at specific locations to perform the tasks. Smart contracts, by operating as processes that are executed on the blockchain, are used to preserve users' privacy and make payments. Furthermore, for the assignment of the crowdsensing tasks to the mobile users, we design a truthful, cost-optimal auction that minimizes the payments from the crowdsensing providers to the mobile users. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed privacy preserving auction outperforms state-of-the-art proposals regarding cost by ten times for high numbers of mobile users and tasks.

Through analyzing the transaction history in blockchain, we found that the account usage frequency is highly heterogeneous. Based on this observation, we propose a new account structure to improve the efficiency. The preliminary experiments show that the proposed structure has obvious advantages in efficiency compared with other account structures.

AB Because of the popularity of the Internet, the integration services have gradually changed people daily life, such as e-commerce activities on transactions, transportation and so on. The E-auction, one of the popular e-commerce activities, allows bidders to directly bid the products over the Internet. As for sealed bid, the extra transaction cost is required for the intermediaries because the third-party is the important role between the buyers and the sellers help to trade both during the auction. In addition, it never guarantees whether the third-party is trust. To resolve the problems, the blockchain technology with low transaction cost is used to develop the smart contract of public bid and sealed bid. The smart contract, proposed in 1990 and implements via Ethereum platform, can ensure the bill secure, private, non-reputability and inalterability owing to all the transactions are recorded in the same but decentralized ledgers. The smart contract is composed of the address of Auctioneer, the start auction time, deadline, the address of current winner, the current highest price. In the experiments, the accounts are created through Ethereum wallet. In miner stage, the MinerGate is used in miner stage for obtaining money to pay the transaction fee. At recorder stage, the nodes of blockchain are synchronized to generate smart contract.

AB Inspired by the success of Bitcoin, many clients for the Bitcoin protocol as well as for alternative blockchain protocols have been implemented. However, implementations may contain errors, and the cost of an error in the case of a cryptocurrency can be extremely high.
   We propose to tackle this problem with a suite of abstract property tests that check whether a blockchain system satisfies laws that most blockchain and blockchain-like systems should satisfy. To test a new blockchain system, its developers need to instantiate generators of random objects to be used by the tests. The test suite then checks the satisfaction of the laws over many random cases. We provide examples of laws in the paper.

AB In recent times, Bitcoin has gained special attention both from industry and academia. The underlying technology that enables Bitcoin (or more generally crypto-currency) is called blockchain. At the core of the blockchain technology is a data structure that keeps record of the transactions in the network. The special feature that distinguishes it from existing technology is its immutability of the stored records. To achieve immutability, it uses consensus and cryptographic mechanisms. As the data is stored in distributed nodes this technology is also termed as "Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)". As many researchers and practitioners are joining the hype of blockchain, some of them are raising the question about the fundamental difference between blockchain and traditional database and its real value or potential. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of both technologies based on a survey of the research literature where blockchain solutions are applied to various scenarios. Based on this analysis, we further develop a decision tree diagram that will help both practitioners and researchers to choose the appropriate technology for their use cases. Using our proposed decision tree we evaluate a sample of the existing works to see to what extent the blockchain solutions have been used appropriately in the relevant problem domains.

AB We present ARCHANGEL; a de-centralised platform for ensuring the long-term integrity of digital documents stored within public archives. Document integrity is fundamental to public trust in archives. Yet currently that trust is built upon institutional reputation - trust at face value in a centralised authority, like a national government archive or University. ARCHANGEL proposes a shift to a technological underscoring of that trust, using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to cryptographically guarantee the provenance, immutability and so the integrity of archived documents. We describe the ARCHANGEL architecture, and report on a prototype of that architecture build over the Ethereum infrastructure. We report early evaluation and feedback of ARCHANGEL from stakeholders in the research data archives space.

AB Business interest in blockchain technology is increasing due the potential for change that it offers. Large scale adoption in enterprise IT environments brings about a need for service management and DevOps processes for blockchain deployments. Nodes in the network may fail or be taken down for maintenance requiring visibility across hybrid, traditional, cloud enabled and cloud native deployments. Service management is necessary to ease deployment woes for those looking to install code within their own data centers on-premises or on dedicated cloud servers and further to handle the life cycle of the deployments that includes security patches, critical updates, upgrades, change management and restarting services. In this paper, we provide a mechanism to optimally perform such operations with no disruption to the consensus and transactions for such emerging blockchain applications.

TI The Formation of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts in the Light of
   Contract Law
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB This contribution examines the formation of (blockchain-based) smart contracts. The term smart contract is used to refer to software programmes which are often, but not necessarily, built on blockchain technology as a set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises. It is regularly said that smart contracts are neither legal contracts in the traditional sense nor they are smart and that the term is therefore a misnomer. The crucial question this article is trying to answer is whether the traditional common law concept of contract formation is seriously challenged by the rise of smart contracts. As such, are smart contracts marking the end of contract formation as we know it or is it just much ado about nothing?

AB We introduce FairSwap -an efficient protocol for fair exchange of digital goods using smart contracts. A fair exchange protocol allows a sender S to sell a digital commodity x for a fixed price p to a receiver R. The protocol is said to be secure if R only pays if he receives the correct x. Our solution guarantees fairness by relying on smart contracts executed over decentralized cryptocurrencies, where the contract takes the role of an external judge that completes the exchange in case of disagreement. While in the past there have been several proposals for building fair exchange protocols over cryptocurrencies, our solution has two distinctive features that makes it particular attractive when users deal with large commodities. These advantages are: (1) minimizing the cost for running the smart contract on the blockchain, and (2) avoiding expensive cryptographic tools such as zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to our new protocols, we provide formal security definitions for smart contract based fair exchange, and prove security of our construction. Finally, we illustrate several applications of our basic protocol and evaluate practicality of our approach via a prototype implementation for fairly selling large files over the cryptocurrency Ethereum.

AB Existing permissionless blockchain solutions rely on peer-to-peer propagation mechanisms, where nodes in a network transfer transaction they received to their neighbors. Unfortunately, there is no explicit incentive for such transaction propagation. Therefore, existing propagation mechanisms will not be sustainable in a fully decentralized blockchain with rational nodes. In this work, we formally define the problem of incentivizing nodes for transaction propagation. We propose an incentive mechanism where each node involved in the propagation of a transaction receives a share of the transaction fee. We also show that our proposal is Sybil-proof. Furthermore, we combine the incentive mechanism with smart routing to reduce the communication and storage costs at the same time. The proposed routing mechanism reduces the redundant transaction propagation from the size of the network to a factor of average shortest path length. The routing mechanism is built upon a specific type of consensus protocol where the round leader who creates the transaction block is known in advance. Note that our routing mechanism is a generic one and can be adopted independently from the incentive mechanism.

AB With the Internet of Things (IoT), Things are expected to live in different "domains" and "contexts" during their lifetime. Information generated by and associated with Things should be manageable by multiple, diverse stakeholders accordingly. Moreover, the scope of the information related to Things can range from private and confidential to public and auditable. Identification, security, and interoperability in this vivid environment are expected to be challenging. In this paper we discuss how smart contracts and blockchain technologies create the potential for a viable solution. To this end, we present smart contract-based solutions that improve security and information management, we identify new opportunities and challenges, and we provide security recommendations and guidelines.

AB The pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin has sparked the twin rivaling researches in Bitcoin community, that is, either protecting or attacking anonymity. In spite of this intense battle, the answer to a primary question is absent - Do Bitcoin users themselves care about anonymity? This paper demystifies this doubt via analyzing the Bitcoin transaction graphs with the following three contributions: 1). We outline three representative metrics that can signify whether users concern about anonymity. 2). We examine the collective trend of anonymity concerns from a macroscope. 3). We pay particular attention on critical addresses in a microscope to unveil their anonymity concerns.
   This paper arrives at both expected conclusions and unexpected surprises. In particular, the expected ones are: rich addresses concern more about anonymity than poor ones. Miner addresses start caring about anonymity when exchange rate soars. Stock addresses never hide their intent of jump-and-dump. The surprises are: the majority of the users show weak concerns on anonymity. One can easily find both hot and cold wallet addresses owned by big organizations.

AB Existing service ecosystems typically rely on some centralized service registries (e.g., ProgrammableWeb. com) as "middle people" to record service behaviors thus to provide service ranking and recommendation. Excessive centralization increasingly becomes the bottleneck and hinders the further growth of the service ecosystems. As the first attempt to apply the fundamental technique underneath the emerging Bitcoin network into the field of service oriented computing, this paper proposes to build a service ecosystem as a decentralized blockchain-oriented service network, called Decentralized Service Eco-System (DSES). Whenever any activity occurs in the system (e.g., APIs are used together in a published mashup), all involved parties will individually store and maintain a copy of the detailed record (provenance) at their local databases. Such a distributed database-oriented solution will enable services who do not fully trust each other to maintain a set of global states. In this way, service discovery and recommendation can be realized in a distributed manner that promises higher scalability and maintainability. As a proof of concept, a prototyping system of DSES is constructed using the real-world data from ProgrammableWeb. com, based on the INKchain, a newly open-source consortium blockchain mechanism extending the Hyperledger Fabric.

TI SMART CONTRACTS: LEGAL FRONTIERS AND INSERTION INTO THE CREATIVE ECONOMY
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB The ultimate development of a disruptive and innovative contractual form has been imposing new challenges and the need of a proper regulatory framework in the legal field. Smart contracts consist on an internet protocol in which programming language and digital codes are used to input clauses that had already been agreed by the parties and that, upon the fulfillment of a determined condition previously established, shall be automatically self-executed. This new way of creating, transferring and extinguishing patrimonial rights and duties has been playing a major role in the context of the Creative Economy, in which intellectual capital, agility and the automatization of operations constitute fundamental factors. In order to investigate the characteristics and possibilities of adopting smart contracts under the perspective of the Brazilian legal order and its insertion in the Creative Economy, this paper has applied the theoretical and methodological framework of the Economic Analysis of Law so as to pursue the analytical exercise that it is committed to perform.

This revolutionary paradigm creates a new dimension that removes the boundaries between the real and the virtual worlds. The Wireless Sensor Networks are a masterpiece of the success of this technology, using limited capacity sensors and actuators, industrial, medical, agricultural and many other environments can be covered and managed automatically. This autonomous interacting things should authenticate each other, and communicate securely. Otherwise malicious users can cause serious damages on such systems. In this paper we propose a robust, transparent, flexible and energy efficient blockchain-based authentication mechanism called BCTrust, which is designed especially for devices with computational, storage and energy consumption constraints. In order to evaluate our approach, we realized a real implementation with C programming language, and Ethereum Blockchain.

AB Blockchain technologies, such as smart contracts, present a unique interface for machine-to-machine communication that provides a secure, append-only record that can be shared without trust and without a central administrator. We study the possibilities and limitations of using smart contracts for machine-to-machine communication by designing, implementing, and evaluating AGasP, an application for automated gasoline purchases. We find that using smart contracts allows us to directly address the challenges of transparency, longevity, and trust in IoT applications. However, real-world applications using smart contracts must address their important trade-offs, such as performance, privacy, and the challenge of ensuring they are written correctly.

AB Recent advances in Blockchain technology has opened up a vast array of decentralized and distributed systems. The most significant contribution of this technology is it gets rid of the third-party functioning as a mediator in systems that requires trust for any kind of transaction. From this perspective, transaction of money is fundamentally an authorized third-party mediating trade of goods or services. In this chapter, we first review the conventional applications of Blockchain and next propose a novel economic system in which such value-added items are exchanged without using money and without going through a third party. In the long history of economics from ancient times, the monetized economy system today has a very short record, and it is essentially based on the existence of trustworthy central banks, governments, and organizations. However in line with the recent growing sense of decentralized systems and in keeping with unstable international affairs including the recent money crisis, it is meaningful to consider alternative economic system which can exist without going through any third party. To address this issue is one of the purposes of this chapter.

However, there are many issues remained to be solved, such as data interoperability, security, and privacy concerns. On the other hand, blockchain, a decentralized peer-to-peer digital ledger, has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as a promising technology to protect privacy of personal data. By adopting blockchain, individuals can take advantage of personal health data for better healthcare. In this paper, after briefly summarizing the major features of blockchain, we describe blockchain-empowered solutions for utilization of personal health data in healthcare and discuss issues and challenges. We further propose i-Blockchain, an individual-centric framework for use of personal health data based on an extension of permissioned blockchain, present the basic architecture and protocols, and show several application scenarios.

This paper aims to provide and enforce data provenance and data integrity in IoT environments by using Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Ethereum, a blockchain variant with smart contracts. PUFs provide unique hardware fingerprints to establish data provenance while Ethereum provides a decentralized digital ledger which is able to withstand data tampering attacks.

AB Product recalls in the healthcare industry contribute to significant supply chain disruptions. In the absence of a reliable product tracking communicating recall information and to recover or safe disposal of the product is extremely challenging. Healthcare product recalls are more generally classified based on severity of risk to patient life and such a classification often does not help supply chain community to assess the impact of recalls and develop alternative sourcing strategies. Hence there is critical need to assess and review healthcare product recalls with an emphasis on supply chain and logistics. In this paper we review the extant literature to identify and categorize factors that often lead to product recalls, and propose a potential approach to enable effective product tracking and recall communication using blockchain technology. The resulting information can aid research and practice community to develop suitable frameworks, models and strategies to mitigate product recalls.

AB The gaming industry is affected by two key issues-cheating and DDoS attacks against game servers. In this paper, we aim to present a novel yet concrete application of the blockchain technology to address the seemingly disparate problems. Our approach uses blockchain to manage definitive game state and exploits peer consensus on every player action to track modifications to tangible player assets. While a key impediment to adopting blockchain for real-time systems is its high per-operation latency, our approach leverages several optimizations to enable real-time prevention of a large class of cheats where the reported client state is inconsistent with the observed state at the server. Further, blockchain-based games leverage the robust peer-to-peer architecture to successfully defend against DDoS attacks.
   Our strategy enables flexibility to customize games with minimum modifications to game clients by porting server-side logic to smart contracts that execute atop peers. We evaluate our approach on a recent port of the multi-player game Doom. Our prototype can scale to client tickrates matched by modern games, and prevent cheats in <150ms for 32 peers deployed across the Internet, which is well within the latency requirements for online gaming.

TI To the moon: defining and detecting cryptocurrency pump-and-dumps
SO CRIME SCIENCE
AB Pump-and-dump schemes are fraudulent price manipulations through the spread of misinformation and have been around in economic settings since at least the 1700s. With new technologies around cryptocurrency trading, the problem has intensified to a shorter time scale and broader scope. The scientific literature on cryptocurrency pump-and-dump schemes is scarce, and government regulation has not yet caught up, leaving cryptocurrencies particularly vulnerable to this type of market manipulation. This paper examines existing information on pump-and-dump schemes from classical economic literature, synthesises this with cryptocurrencies, and proposes criteria that can be used to define a cryptocurrency pump-and-dump. These pump-and-dump patterns exhibit anomalous behaviour; thus, techniques from anomaly detection research are utilised to locate points of anomalous trading activity in order to flag potential pump-and-dump activity. The findings suggest that there are some signals in the trading data that might help detect pump-and-dump schemes, and we demonstrate these in our detection system by examining several real-world cases. Moreover, we found that fraudulent activity clusters on specific cryptocurrency exchanges and coins. The approach, data, and findings of this paper might form a basis for further research into this emerging fraud problem and could ultimately inform crime prevention.

TI Blockchain for a Trust Network Among Intelligent Vehicles
SO BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: PLATFORMS, TOOLS AND USE CASES
SE Advances in Computers
AB The intelligent vehicle communication network is prone to cyberthreats, which are difficult to solve using traditional centralized security approaches. Blockchain is an immutable peer-to-peer distributed database containing cryptographically secured information. Blockchain shows successful use cases in financial applications, smart contact, protecting digital copyright of media contents. It extends to all industries including the secure IoT devices, embedded systems, etc. The superior feature of blockchain is its decentralized, immutable, auditable database that secures transactions by protecting privacy. In this chapter, we contemplate the environment of the intelligent vehicle communication network and issues regarding methods of building a blockchain-based trust network among intelligent vehicles. We present the use cases of blockchain in intelligent vehicles in the phase of ongoing research or that under development from automotive industries and academic institutes. We also deliberate the challenging issue of blockchain for intelligent vehicles.

AB Four major search engines, Google in particular, hold a unique position in enabling the use of the Internet, as they alone direct over 98% of Internet users to the content they seek, using proprietary indices. While the contribution of these companies is undeniable, their design is necessarily affected by their economic interests, which may or may not align with those of the users, raising concerns regarding their effect on the availability of information around the globe. While multiple academic and commercial projects aimed to distribute and democratize the Web search, they failed to gain much traction, mostly due to inferior results and lack of incentives for participation. In this paper, we show how complex networking-intensive tasks can be crowdsourced using Bitcoin's incentive model. We present Webcoin, a novel distributed digital-currency which utilizes networking resources rather then computational, and can only be mined through Web indexing. Webcoin provides both the incentives and the means to create Google-scale indices, freely available to competing services and the public. Webcoin's design overcomes numerous unique challenges, such as index verification, scalability, and nodes' ability to actively manipulate webpages. We deploy 200 fully-functioning Webcoin nodes and demonstrate their low bandwidth requirements.

AB In most crowdsensing systems, the quality of the collected data is varied and difficult to evaluate while the existing crowdsensing quality control methods are mostly based on a central platform, which is not completely trusted in reality and results in fraud and other problems. To solve these questions, a novel crowdsensing quality control model is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and twice consensuses are proposed to realize the non-repudiation and non-tampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, the quality grading evaluation (QGE) is put forward, in which the method of truth discovery and the idea of fuzzy theories are combined to evaluate the quality of sensing data, and the garbled circuit is used to ensure that evaluation criteria can not be leaked. Finally, the Experiments show that our model is feasible in time and effective in quality evaluation.

AB (1)Food safety is becoming more and more serious topic worldwide. To tackle the food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting, warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized, open and ecological food traceability system based on blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, which involves all parties of a smart agriculture ecosystem, even if they may not trust each other. We use IoT devices to replace manual recording and verification as many as possible, which can reduce the human intervention to the system effectively. Furthermore, we plan to use the smart contract technology to help the law-executor to find problems and process them timely.

This paper studies the current charging and discharging schemes for EV and the feasibility of the decentralized transactional energy market. In order to adapt the high volume of EV integration and fully decentralize the grid system, the blockchain technology is introduced to serve as an envision for the next generation grid. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain technology enabled electricity exchange market to enable EVs' autonomy in trading energy with secured distributed energy transactions. The constructed exchange market is price competitive platform where the best bid price is modelled via the jump-diffusion process to enable users to participate in the trading process. We demonstrate that our proposed distributed energy exchange system can perform the peer-to-peer transaction with the real-time electricity price aligning with the EV power demand trend without requiring a third-party intermediary.

AB We are living in the age that crisis events happen everywhere and every day. Video evidence plays an important role in restoring the truth of the incident. The credibility of video evidence is gradually declining. On the one hand, the credibility of the government has been questioned. On the other hand, malicious attackers will distort the video and publish it on the Internet to mislead public. Inspired by the blockchain, this paper proposes a model based on blockchain to ensure the credibility of video evidence, which is called Video-Chain. VideoChain is essentially a blockchain system, but different from digital currency such as Bitcoin. It records the hash of the surveillance video. This paper takes the campus Video Surveillance as an example to describe the architecture and operation of VideoChain. We also give a consensus protocol based on the proof of stake according to the application scenario. The analysis shows that VideoChain is traceable and non-tampering, which can effectively ensure the credibility of video surveillance data. It also has good operational efficiency. This research is of great significance to enhance the trust between the government and citizens, which will improve the credibility of the government.

TI A Game-Theoretic Analysis of Shard-Based Permissionless Blockchains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Low transaction throughput and poor scalability are significant issues in public blockchain consensus protocols, such as Bitcoins. Recent research efforts in this direction have proposed shard-based consensus protocols where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple committees (or shards), which then process these shards or set of transactions in parallel. Such a parallel processing of disjoint sets of transactions or shards by multiple committees significantly improves the overall scalability and transaction throughout of the system. However, one significant research gap is a lack of understanding of the strategic behavior of rational processors within committees in such shard-based consensus protocols. Such an understanding is critical for designing appropriate incentives that will foster cooperation within committees and prevent free-riding. In this paper, we address this research gap by analyzing the behavior of processors using a game-theoretic model, where each processor aims at maximizing its reward at a minimum cost of participating in the protocol. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in an N-player static game model of the sharding protocol. We show that depending on the reward sharing approach employed, processors can potentially increase their payoff by unilaterally behaving in a defective fashion, thus resulting in a social dilemma. In order to overcome this social dilemma, we propose a novel incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism to promote cooperation among processors. Our numerical results show that achieving a majority of cooperating processors (required to ensure a healthy state of the blockchain network) is easier to achieve with the proposed incentive-compatible reward sharing mechanism than with other reward sharing mechanisms.

TI Social Commerce as a Driver to Enhance Trust and Intention to Use
   Cryptocurrencies for Electronic Payments
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The deployment of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce has reached a significant number of transactions and continuous increases in monetary circulation; nevertheless, they face two impediments: a lack of awareness of the technological utility, and a lack of trust among consumers. E-commerce carried out through social networks expands its application to a new paradigm called social commerce. Social commerce uses the content generated within social networks to attract new consumers and influence their behavior. The objective of this paper is to analyze the role played by social media in increasing trust and intention to use cryptocurrencies in making electronic payments. It develops a model that combines constructs from social support theory, social commerce, and the technology acceptance model. This model is evaluated using the partial least square analysis. The obtained results show that social commerce increases the trust and intention to use cryptocurrencies. However, mutual support among participants does not generate sufficient trust to adequately promote the perceived usefulness of cryptocurrencies. This research provides a practical tool for analyzing how collaborative relationships that emerge in social media can influence or enhance the adoption of a new technology in terms of perceived trust and usefulness. Furthermore, it provides a significant contribution to consumer behavior research by applying the social support theory to the adoption of new information technologies. These theoretical and practical contributions are detailed in the final section of the paper.

AB There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data consumers and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block is proposed to avoid large sized blocks. This paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed framework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits.

TI Implementation of Smart Contracts Using Hybrid Architectures with On and

AB Decentralised (on-blockchain) and centralised (off blockchain) platforms are available for the implementation of smart contracts. However, none of the two alternatives can individually provide the services and quality of services (QoS) imposed on smart contracts involved in a large class of applications. The reason is that blockchain platforms suffer from scalability, performance, transaction costs and other limitations. Likewise, off blockchain platforms are afflicted by drawbacks emerging from their dependence on single trusted third parties. We argue that in several applications, hybrid platforms composed from the integration of on and off blockchain platforms are more adequate. Developers that informatively choose between the three alternatives are likely to implement smart contracts that deliver the expected QoS. Hybrid architectures are largely unexplored. To help cover the gap and as a proof of concept, in this paper we discuss the implementation of smart contracts on hybrid architectures. We show how a smart contract can be split and executed partially on an off blockchain contract compliance checker and partially on the rinkeby ethereum network. To test the solution, we expose it to sequences of contractual operations generated mechanically by a contract validator tool.

AB The Ripple credit network has emerged as a payment backbone with key advantages for financial institutions and the remittance industry. Its path-based IOweYou (IOU) settlements across different (crypto)currencies conceptually distinguishes the Ripple blockchain from cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and altcoins), and makes it highly suitable to an orthogonal yet vast set of applications in the remittance world for cross-border transactions and beyond.
   This work studies the structure and evolution of the Ripple network since its inception, and investigates its vulnerability to devilry attacks that affect the IOU credit of linnet users' wallets. We find that about 13M USD are at risk in the current Ripple network due to inappropriate configuration of the rippling flag on credit links, facilitating undesired redistribution of credit across those links. Although the Ripple network has grown around a few highly connected hub (gateway) wallets that constitute the core of the network and provide high liquidity to users, such a credit link distribution results in a user base of around 112, 000 wallets that can be financially isolated by as few as 10 highly connected gateway wallets. Indeed, today about 4.9M USD cannot be withdrawn by their owners from the Ripple network due to PayRoutes, a gateway tagged as faulty by the Ripple community. Finally, we observe that stale exchange offers pose a real problem, and exchanges (market makers) have not always been vigilant about periodically updating their exchange offers according to current real-world exchange rates. For example, stale offers were used by 84 Ripple wallets to gain more than 4.5M USD from mid July to mid-August 2017. Our findings should prompt the Ripple community to improve the health of the network by educating its users on increasing their connectivity, and by appropriately maintaining the credit limits, rippling flags, and exchange offers on their IOU credit links.

TI Personality Disorders Are Not as We Thought: Hierarchical Factor
   Structure at the Criterion Level
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT
AB The use of personality disorder (PD) categories persists, despite the evidence against them. An often overlooked reason for this is the fact that the true structure underlying the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) taxonomy is still unknown: We cannot be certain which disorders are valid, and which ones are arbitrary mixtures of heterogeneous traits. To address this gap, we factor analyzed the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire (PDQ-4C; Hyler, 1994) at the criterion level in a mixed clinical and nonclinical sample of 2,519 individuals. The resulting structure was more similar to current dimensional taxonomies than to the DSM classification at all hierarchical levels. Whereas paranoid and antisocial PDs-and to a lesser extent avoidant, dependent, depressive, and schizoid PDs-were fairly homogeneous, all other disorders turned out to be combinations of 2 or 3 unrelated dimensions. Our results strongly support the structure of empirically based dimensional taxonomies and relocate DSM criteria within this emerging framework, thus contributing to preserving much of the knowledge accumulated to date.

AB DAO attack showed that formal verification of smart contracts is an important issue that should be addressed to prevent irreversible consequences due to design faults activation in Blockchain applications. This paper proposes a modeling method of an Ethereum application based on smart contracts, with the aim of applying a formal method, namely Model-Checking, to verify that the application implementation complies with its specification, formalized by a set of temporal logic propositions. NuSMV tool has been chosen to support this first approach. The proposed model template is shaped by three layers capturing respectively the behavior of Ethereum blockchain, the smart contracts themselves and the execution framework. The approach is illustrated by a case study coming from energy market field.

AB Fog and edge architectures provide a link between centralised clouds and the world of IoT and sensors. The architectures consist of devices of different sizes that coordinate the communication with sensors and cloud services, and that process data from or for the sensors and the cloud locally. In dynamic settings that allow resources to be created, placed, used and removed at any time, advanced orchestration techniques are needed for the activities. Often, these architectures cross organisational boundaries, which causes trust concerns. The origin of data and the identity of sensors or actuators needs to be identified. Additionally, data needs to be stored securely. Orchestration activities across boundaries are subject to a contractual perspective. We present here an architecture pattern that supports trusted orchestration for edge clouds. The W3C Provenance standard is the conceptual foundation of the pattern. Permissioned blockchain technology serves as the platform to implement the provenance framework.

AB Many studies have been done to improve the performance of centrally controlled business processes and enhance the integration between different parties of these collaborations. However, the most serious issues of collaborative business processes remained unsolved in these studies - lack of trust and divided data on various confidential ledgers. Blockchain technology has enormous potential to become a new substantial integration method for untrusted collaborative businesses. Using the governing consensus mechanism, blockchain eliminates the necessity of the trusted third party. It provides a distributed shared ledger which facilitates the job of the process monitoring for the parties. The smart contract, as a crucial tool, is used to define the guaranteed autonomous programs. In addition, the privacy of the data can be ensured by using a permissioned blockchain that handles the access control because, in this way, only verifiable participants can have access to the state of the business process and its related information. In this study, the applicability of execution of a real-world untrusted business process on the permissioned blockchain is investigated. Moreover, we determine the advantages of using the permissioned access-controller blockchain as the infrastructure for the collaborative business processes, through implementing the process of Order Processing on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform.

TI A TISM modeling of critical success factors of blockchain based cloud
   services
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH
AB Purpose Over last few years, a major innovation known as blockchain technology has emerged as potentially one of the most disruptive technology of recent times. The purpose of this paper is to identify and analyze various critical success factors (CSFs) that can facilitate success of blockchain-based cloud services. Further, this paper aims to analyze and understand mutual interactions among these CSFs.
   Design/methodology/approach In this paper, 19 CSFs have been identified through literature review and expert opinions. The hierarchical framework developed using total interpretive structural modeling has revealed the inter-dependencies among these CSFs. The methodology employed in this study provides a mechanism to conduct an exploratory study by identifying the factors and analyzing their interactions through the development of a hierarchical framework. This research further categorizes CSFs into multiple clusters based on their driving power and dependence power.
   Findings This paper has identified 19 CSFs, namely, user engagement, industry collaboration, rich ecosystem, blockchain technology standardization, regulatory clarity, cost efficiency, energy efficiency (wasted resources), handling blockchain bloat, miner incentives, business case alignment to blockchain capability, sidechains development, blockchain talent pool availability, leadership readiness for a decentralized consensus based technology, technology investment and maturity, trust on blockchain networks, integration with other cloud services, robust and mature smart contracts platform, blockchain security and user control on data (privacy). Further, driver and dependent variables have been identified.
   Research limitations/implications Future research can discover and detail the sub-factors behind the 19 CSFs identified in this paper. Additionally, more work can be done to extend the current structural model for blockchain-based services to a more functional form.
   Practical implications It provides a comprehensive list of CSFs that are relevant for development of blockchain-based cloud services. This will help industry leaders to strategically focus on the main drivers that will ensure that businesses get maximum benefit of this disruptive technology.
   Originality/value This study makes a significant contribution in the literature of blockchain-based cloud services, which captures the perspective of different stakeholders. This study is one of the first (if not the first) systematic research on adoption of blockchain-based services. It creates the foundation to carry out further research in this area.

TI Bitcoin Concepts, Threats, and Machine-Learning Security Solutions
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The concept of Bitcoin was first introduced by an unknown individual (or a group of people) named Satoshi Nakamoto before it was released as open-source software in 2009. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components. Next, we detail the existing threats and weaknesses of the Bitcoin system and its main technologies including the blockchain protocol. Last, we discuss current existing security studies and solutions and summarize open research challenges and trends for future research in Bitcoin security.

TI Taxation of the Bitcoin: initial insights through a correspondence
   analysis
SO MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH
AB Purpose - The Bitcoin has experienced wide popularity in academic and commercial spheres during the years following 2012. Research has been conducted in respect of information technology, finance and reporting paradigms, but there has been little research into the taxation of the Bitcoin. The purpose of this paper is to present a conceptual approach for developing a taxation policy for the Bitcoin, using a multi-jurisdictional analysis.
   Design/methodology/approach - An interpretive mixed-method approach is followed. The traits of the Bitcoin are determined through a review of the literature, followed by the determination of key taxation themes using a multi-jurisdictional view where the jurisdictions were determined using the largest Bitcoin exchanges. These form the row and column headings of the correspondence table research instrument, respectively. The correspondence table was completed by 40 tax experts. Correspondence analysis (a multivariate statistical technique) was then used to determine correlations between the Bitcoin traits and taxation themes, further used to present initial insights into developing a taxation policy for the Bitcoin.
   Findings - The correspondence analysis reveals that, contrary to current tax laws, the manner of acquisition as opposed to the reason (intention) for acquisition is key in determining how the Bitcoin is to be taxed. For taxing purposes, Bitcoin is seen as being distinct from currency, given that transactions with the Bitcoin are seen as barter transactions. Finally, because of the unique characteristics of the Bitcoin, it is shown that exchanges and the Bitcoin need to be regulated in the same manner as a currency.
   Research limitations/implications - This research focuses on income tax including capital gains tax and consumption taxes and was conducted with a sample of purposefully selected South African tax experts, given that the Bitcoin is experiencing enhanced popularity in South Africa. As a result, this research does not provide generalisable positivist conclusions and does not purport to represent the views of all tax practitioners. This paper does, however, provide an initial mechanism to develop taxation treatments for transactions not covered by existing legislation.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first to provide normative recommendations on the taxation of the Bitcoin. Using correspondence analysis, this paper offers an innovative approach for developing taxation policies when a transaction is not specifically included in the extant legislation. Further value is added through the use of a third dimension in the correspondence analysis which enhances the exploratory potential of the research.

AB Blockchain technology has evolved from being an immutable ledger of transactions for cryptocurrencies to a programmable interactive environment for building distributed reliable applications. Although the blockchain technology has been used to address various challenges, to our knowledge none of the previous work focused on using Blockchain to develop a secure and immutable scientific data provenance management framework that automatically verifies the provenance records. In this work, we leverage Blockchain as a platform to facilitate trustworthy data provenance collection, verification, and management. The developed system utilizes smart contracts and open provenance model (OPM) to record immutable data trails. We show that our proposed framework can securely capture and validate provenance data that prevents any malicious modification to the captured data as long as the majority of the participants are honest.

AB Reproducibility is the ability of recreating identical binaries under pre-defined build environments. Due to the need of quality assurance and the benefit of better detecting attacks against build environments, the practice of reproducible builds has gained popularity in many open-source software repositories such as Debian and Bitcoin. However, identifying the unreproducible issues remains a labour intensive and time consuming challenge, because of the lacking of information to guide the search and the diversity of the causes that may lead to the unreproducible binaries.
   In this paper we propose an automated framework called RepLoc to localize the problematic files for unreproducible builds. RepLoc features a query augmentation component that utilizes the information extracted from the build logs, and a heuristic rule-based filtering component that narrows the search scope. By integrating the two components with a weighted file ranking module, RepLoc is able to automatically produce a ranked list of files that are helpful in locating the problematic files for the unreproducible builds. We have implemented a prototype and conducted extensive experiments over 671 real-world unreproducible Debian packages in four different categories. By considering the topmost ranked file only, RepLoc achieves an accuracy rate of 47.09%. If we expand our examination to the top ten ranked files in the list produced by RepLoc, the accuracy rate becomes 79.28%. Considering that there are hundreds of source code, scripts, Makefiles, etc., in a package, RepLoc significantly reduces the scope of localizing problematic files. Moreover, with the help of RepLoc, we successfully identified and fixed six new unreproducible packages from Debian and Guix.

TI Blockchain Technology: Is It a Good Candidate for Securing IoT Sensitive
   Medical Data?
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In the past few years, the number of wireless devices connected to the Internet has increased to a number that could reach billions in the next few years. While cloud computing is being seen as the solution to process this data, security challenges could not be addressed solely with this technology. Security problems will continue to increase with such a model, especially for private and sensitive data such as personal data and medical data collected with more and more smarter connected devices constituting the so called Internet of Things. As a consequence, there is an urgent need for a fully decentralized peer-to-peer and secure technology solution to overcome these problems. The blockchain technology is a promising just-in-time solution that brings the required properties to the field. However, there are still challenges to address before using it in the context of IoT. This paper discusses these challenges and proposes a secure IoT architecture for medical data based on blockchain technology. The solution introduces a protocol for data access, smart contracts and a publisher-subscriber mechanism for notification. A simple analytical model is also presented to highlight the performance of the system. An implementation of the solution as a proof of concept is also presented.

AB Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have unique anti-angiogenic properties and have been applied in a variety of cancers studies. 'Naked' gold nanoparticles directly bound to angiogenic factors have been demonstrated to inhibit growth factor-mediated signalling in vitro and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced angiogenesis in vivo. Angiogenin (Ang) is a protein physiologically constituent the human plasma but also a pathological marker of different cancer types.
   Herein, the peptide Ang(60-68), encompassing the putative cellular binding site of the protein Ang, has been synthesized and characterized in the interaction with spherical AuNPs of 12 nm of diameter. The Mg mimicking activity of the peptide was assessed in terms of cell cytoskeleton rearrangements visualized by staining of actin, which is an important target of the whole protein. The hybrid assemblies obtained by physical adsorption of the peptide molecules at the surface of the gold nanoparticles were scrutinised by UV visible spectroscopy, to characterize with titration experiments the changes in the plasmonic properties of AuNPs as well as the peptide spectral features. The latter were obtained by using the fluorescent analogous peptide, Fam-Ang(59-68), incorporating the carboxyfluorescein (Fam) moiety, through an amidic bond of the N-terminal residue. The hydrodynamic size of the peptide-Au systems were determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. Proof-of work experiments with human neuroblastoma cells line demonstrated the non-toxicity of the Ang-mimicking peptide functionalised gold nanoparticles. Moreover, laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM) experiments showed the localization of the peptide-nanoparticles at the cell membrane and their sub-cellular distribution. These data reveal a promising new platform for imaging and therapeutic activities in cancer therapy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain for Cities-A Systematic Literature Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain is considered one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Numerous cities around the world are launching blockchain initiatives as part of the overall efforts toward shaping the urban future. However, the infancy stage of the blockchain industry leads to a severe gap between the knowledge we have and the actions urban policy makers are taking. This paper is an effort to narrow this rift. We provide a systematic literature review on concrete blockchain use cases proposed by the research community. At the macro-level, we discuss and organize use cases from 159 selected papers into nine sectors recognized as crucial for sustainable and smart urban future. At the micro-level, we identify a component-based framework and analyze the design and prototypes of blockchain systems studied in a subset of 71 papers. The high-level use case review allows us to illustrate the relationship between them and the four pillars of urban sustainability: social, economic, environmental, and governmental. The system level analysis helps us highlight interesting inconsistencies between well-known blockchain applicability decision rules and the approaches taken by the literature. We also offer two classification methodologies for blockchain use cases and elaborate on how they can be applied to stimulate cross-sector insights in the blockchain knowledge domain.

AB Bitcoin provides freshness properties by forming a blockchain where each block is associated with its timestamp and the previous block. Due to these properties, the Bitcoin protocol is being used as a decentralized, trusted, and secure timestamping service. Although Bitcoin participants which create new blocks cannot modify their order, they can manipulate timestamps almost undetected. This undermines the Bitcoin protocol as a reliable timestamping service. In particular, a newcomer that synchronizes the entire blockchain has a little guarantee about timestamps of all blocks.
   In this paper, we present a simple yet powerful mechanism that increases the reliability of Bitcoin timestamps. Our protocol can provide evidence that a block was created within a certain time range. The protocol is efficient, backward compatible, and surprisingly, currently deployed SSL/TLS servers can act as reference time sources. The protocol has many applications and can be used for detecting various attacks against the Bitcoin protocol.

AB Studies suggest that a significant proportion of the diagnosis in non-communicable diseases (NCD) is erroneous, unwanted, or unnecessary. To reduce the disease burden and improve public health, algorithmic support is essential. To realize this, health data must be computer understandable, secured, ubiquitous, and interoperable. Medical and disease data entered into computers are unstructured natural language texts with medical jargons which a computer normally cannot understand. EMR (Electronic Medical Records) are data silos in the hospital and do not interoperate. In this paper we present Ethereum based future ready Proof of Disease (PoD) consensus protocol with a computer understandable single instance of truth. It will solve many challenges that electronic health records (EHR) or health information exchange (HIE) have failed to address. This medical system will help achieve all the complex needs of P6 (Participatory, Personalized, Proactive, Preventive, Predictive and Precision) medicine and finally reduce the disease burden.

AB The capability of executing so-called smart contracts in a decentralised manner is one of the compelling features of modern blockchains. Smart contracts are fully. edged programs which cannot be changed once deployed to the blockchain. They typically implement the business logic of distributed apps and carry billions of dollars worth of coins. In that respect, it is imperative that smart contracts are correct and have no vulnerabilities or bugs. However, research has identified different classes of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, some of which led to prominent multi-million dollar fraud cases.
   In this paper we focus on vulnerabilities related to integer bugs, a class of bugs that is particularly difficult to avoid due to some characteristics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the Solidity programming language. In this paper we introduce OSIRIS - a framework that combines symbolic execution and taint analysis, in order to accurately find integer bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. Osiris detects a greater range of bugs than existing tools, while providing a better specificity of its detection. We have evaluated its performance on a large experimental dataset containing more than 1.2 million smart contracts. We found that 42,108 contracts contain integer bugs. Besides being able to identify several vulnerabilities that have been reported in the past few months, we were also able to identify a yet unknown critical vulnerability in a couple of smart contracts that are currently deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

AB Maintaining data provenance in cloud in a tamper-resistant manner that cannot be breached by malicious parties is a necessity from the current security standpoint. Blockchain technology has emerged as a secure solution to store and share information by offering an immutable distributed ledger service. Its effectiveness hinges on the infrastructure supporting the distributed ledger and consensus protocol that governs the validity of entries in the Blockchain. Hence, Blockchain can be a potential candidate to implement data provenance; however, traditional cryptocurrency-based consensus models become a bottleneck in the cloud environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Blockchain based data provenance architecture (BlockCloud) that incorporates a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based consensus protocol (CloudPoS) for securely recording the data operations occurring in cloud environment. The critical operational phases of the protocol are discussed in depth, which leverages the cloud users' cyber infrastructure resources. A cloud-based testbed environment is created using a local cluster of physical machines managed by Xen hypervisor. Resource elasticity is enabled using Kubernetes setup that interacts with the dockerized containers, which emulate as peers in the Blockchain network. We then evaluate the effectiveness of the protocol in a simulated environment and conduct performance tests of the proposed consensus.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies secure a decentralized consensus protocol by incentives. The protocol participants, called miners, generate (mine) a series of blocks, each containing monetary transactions created by system users. As incentive for participation, miners receive newly minted currency and transaction fees paid by transaction creators. Blockchain bandwidth limits lead users to pay increasing fees in order to prioritize their transactions. However, most prior work focused on models where fees are negligible. In a notable exception, Carlsten et al. [17] postulated that if incentives come only from fees then a mining gap would form - miners would avoid mining when the available fees are insufficient.
   In this work, we analyze cryptocurrency security in realistic settings, taking into account all elements of expenses and rewards. To study when gaps form, we analyze the system as a game we call the gap game. We analyze the game with a combination of symbolic and numeric analysis tools in a wide range of scenarios.
   Our analysis confirms Carlsten et al.'s postulate; indeed, we show that gaps form well before fees are the only incentive, and analyze the implications on security. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that different miners choose different gap sizes to optimize their utility, even when their operating costs are identical. Alarmingly, we see that the system incentivizes large miner coalitions, reducing system decentralization. We describe the required conditions to avoid the incentive misalignment, providing guidelines for future cryptocurrency design.

AB Supply chain management is hampered by a lack of information sharing among partners. Information is not shared as organizations in the supply chain do not have direct contact and/or do not want to share competitive and privacy sensitive information. In addition, companies are often part of multiple supply chains and trading partners vary over time. Blockchains are distributed ledgers in which all parties in a network can have access to data under certain conditions. Private blockchains can be used to support parties in making their demand data directly available to all other parties in their supply chain. These parties can use this data to improve their planning and reduce the bullwhip effect. However, the transparency that blockchain technology offers makes it more difficult to protect sensitive data. The dynamics between these properties are not well understood. In this paper, we design and evaluate a blockchain architecture to explore its feasibility for reducing information asymmetry, while at the same time protecting sensitive data. We found that blockchain technology can allow parties to balance their need for inventory management with their need for flexibility for changing partners. However, measures to protect sensitive data lead either to reduced information, or to reduced speed by which the information can be accessed.

AB Blockchains are used to perform state agreement in a distributed system. However, there is no way to validate off-chain actions, such as physical actions, in the current architecture. This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture which features locally physically-verified transactions. From this new architecture, this paper presents a protocol for securing vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) without the need to constantly communicate with roadside units (RSUs) or other infrastructure components. However, issues such as privacy in VANETs and Blockchains are left to future work. This paper shows the results from simulations of the current system in order to note its weaknesses. In particular, this paper can be used as a benchmark to show that ideas such as Proof-of-Work and full blockchain validation cannot work in a purely peer-to-peer VANET.

AB The blockchain is an emerging technology. Because of its efficiency and functionality, it is widely considered to have revolutionary application prospects. As a supporting part of the data structure, the hash function is important for ensuring the availability and security of the blockchain. To evaluate the security of blockchain technology it is important to analyze several security criteria of the hash functions used in the blockchain. This paper focuses on two security criteria-hiding and puzzle-friendliness-that the hash function should satisfy in the blockchain proposed by Narayanan et al. (Narayanan A, Bonneau J, Felten E, et al. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies: A Comprehensive Introduction. Princeton University Press, 2016). Under the framework of Rogaway-Shrimpton's theory, their definitions are mathematically described and their relation is proved. Also, comparisons between the two criteria and traditional ones in hash functions are made. The conclusions of this paper point out that for hash functions, it is harder to break hiding and puzzle-friendliness than to break preimage resistance, which shows that hash functions proven to be preimage-resistant or tested by preimage cryptanalysis like SHA256 tend to be enough to be used in the corresponding parts of the blockchain design. At the same time, from the attackers' view the conclusions can provide a theoretical basis for studying the potential attacks on and defects that may exist in the structure of the hash functions applied in the blockchain.

AB The smart community (SC), as an important part of the Internet of energy (IoE), can facilitate integration of distributed renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) in the smart grid. However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy consumption preferences in SC. In this paper, we propose a contract based energy blockchain for secure EV charging in SC. Firstly, a permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Secondly, a reputation based delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (DBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed to efficiently achieve the consensus in the permissioned blockchain. Furthermore, based on the contract theory, the optimal contracts are analyzed and designed to satisfy EVs' individual needs from energy sources while maximizing the operator's utility. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through comparison with other conventional schemes.

TI Is Bitcoin a Waste of Resources?
SO FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ST LOUIS REVIEW
AB Do Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies play a useful social role, or do they represent a social waste? Bitcoin is a decentralized recordkeeping system, with updating of the record of transactions in the blockchain. Potentially, Bitcoin could be useful if it is widely used as a means of payment or as a safe-haven asset. But, given its properties, it is an inefficient and poorly designed means of payment and probably cannot survive as a safe haven asset. Bitcoin could encourage crime, which is a further social cost, but fortunately it may not serve criminals well either.

The architecture is built on top of existing databases maintained by health providers, implements a blockchain solution to improve interoperability of the current EHR systems, prevent tampering and malicious misuse of EHRs by means of tracking all events that happened to the data in the databases. This proposed architecture also introduces a new incentive mechanism for the creation of new blocks in the blockchain. The architecture is independent of any specific blockchain platforms and open to further extensions, hence potentially fits in with other electronic record systems that require protection against tampering and misuse.

AB Blockchain has attracted a great deal of attention due to its secure way of distributing transactions between different nodes without a trust entity, and tracking the validity of data. Although many experts argue the solutions to several problems in today's inherently insecure Internet lies with blockchain technology because of its security and privacy features, there is no systemic survey to analyze and summarize blockchain technology from different perspectives. In this paper, we present the current trends in blockchain technology from both technical and application viewpoints and highlight the key challenges and future work required that will help in determining what is possible when blockchain is applied to existing and future problems.

TI Optimization of Executable Formal Interpreters Developed in Higher-Order
   Logic Theorem Proving Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent publications, we presented a novel formal symbolic process virtual machine (FSPVM) framework that combined higher-order logic theorem proving and symbolic execution for verifying the reliability and security of smart contracts developed in the Ethereum blockchain system without suffering from standard issues surrounding reusability, consistency, and automation. A specific FSPVM, denoted as FSPVM-E, was developed in Coq based on a general, extensible, and reusable formal memory framework, an extensible and universal formal intermediate programming language, denoted as Lolisa, and a corresponding formally verified interpreter for Lolisa, denoted as FEther. However, our past work has demonstrated that the execution efficiency of the standard development of FEther is extremely low. As a result, FSPVM-E fails to achieve its expected verification effect. This paper addresses this issue by first identifying three root causes of the low execution efficiency of formal interpreters. We then build abstract models of these causes, and present respective optimization schemes for rectifying the identified conditions. Finally, we apply these optimization schemes to FEther, and demonstrate that its execution efficiency has been improved significantly.

AB Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) allows multiple organizations to share transaction data while protecting data integrity without the need for a central authority. However, there is a strong need to protect the privacy of transactions from parties that are not stakeholders of each transaction. Since DLT is a technology for sharing replicas of the same ledger data across multiple parties, protecting confidentiality and data privacy is essentially difficult. In this paper, we first define the properties of integrity and privacy requirements and discuss the requirements in typical use cases. Finally, we review how the requirements are addressed in existing implementations.

AB In the area of loT (Internet of Things), more and more intelligent devices are being connected to the Internet. These intelligent devices have been producing a huge amout of useful data over time, however there is still a lack of a platform which can efficiently transfer and utilize the value of the massive loT data. Blockchain is able to transfer value kith a relative low cost, which makes it possible for the data from smart devices to create economic value. This work of this paper is to design a high performance bloc I:chain platform, using technologies such as distributed network architecture, intelligent devices node mapping, as well as PBFT-DPOC consensus algorithm to realize the decentralized autonomy of intelligent devices.

AB At present, the use of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in electronic payment systems (EPS) based on cryptocurrencies gives a decisive advantage in mining. In the future, this can lead to the fact that the computing power of the network will be concentrated in the hands of a limited number of participants that contradicts the ideas of Bitcoin's creators about a distributed electronic payment system. This article describes one of the solutions to this problem, namely the use of ASIC-resistant hash functions in the proof-of-work system, which will help make EPS more distributed and, accordingly, more stable. The purpose of the study is to analyze ASIC-resistant hash functions. Modified algorithms of the proof-of-work mechanism are proposed.

SO COMPLEXITY
AB We investigate the cross-correlations of return-volume relationship of the Bitcoin market. In particular, we select eight exchange rates whose trading volume accounts for more than 98% market shares to synthesize Bitcoin indexes. The empirical results based on multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) reveal that (1) the nonlinear dependencies and power-law cross-correlations in return-volume relationship are found; (2) all cross-correlations are multifractal, and there are antipersistent behaviors of cross-correlation for q= 2; (3) the price of small fluctuations is more persistent than that of the volume, while the volume of larger fluctuations is more antipersistent; and (4) the rolling window method shows that the cross-correlations of return-volume are antipersistent in the entire sample period.

AB As blockchain technologies mature and ecosystems over blockchain evolve, peers on blockchain networks often face situations in which they need to conduct voting for decision-making; as happened in the case of the DAO hard fork event on Ethereum. However, a natively built-in voting mechanism is not available on any of the existing blockchain platforms. Thus, the decision making either is delegated to a few network members who make such decisions offline or is dependent on third party online voting services. In both cases, peers directly or indirectly rely on trusted parties or centralized systems. This is against the basic decentralization principle of blockchain and exposes the election to frauds. To facilitate decision-making in a decentralized and secure manner, we propose a native blockchain voting protocol for peers to vote over their existing blockchain network without the need of any trusted or third party. Our protocol preserves end-toend privacy and possesses desirable properties such as detectability and correctability against cheating. A reference implementation of our protocol on Hyperledger Fabric that demonstrates the validity and practical applicability of our protocol is also provided.

AB The development of Vehicular Ad-hoc NETwork (VANET) has brought many conveniences to human beings, but also brings a very prominent security problem. The traditional solution to the security problem is based on centralized approach which requires a trusted central entity which exists a single point of failure problem. Moreover, there is no approach of technical level to ensure security of data. Therefore, this paper proposes a security architecture of VANET based on blockchain and mobile edge computing. The architecture includes three layers, namely perception layer, edge computing layer and service layer. The perception layer ensures the security of VANET data in the transmission process through the blockchain technology. The edge computing layer provides computing resources and edge cloud services to the perception layer. The service layer uses the combination of traditional cloud storage and blockchain to ensure the security of data.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing are increasingly integrated, in the sense that data collected from IoT devices (generally with limited computational and storage resources) are being sent to the cloud for processing, etc., in order to inform decision making and facilitate other operational and business activities. However, the cloud may not be a fully trusted entity, like leaking user data or compromising user privacy. Thus, we propose a privacy-preserving and user-controlled data sharing architecture with fine-grained access control, based on the blockchain model and attribute-based cryptosystem. Also, the consensus algorithm in our system is the Byzantine fault tolerance mechanism, rather than Proof of Work.

In some papers, the performance of blockchain is analyzed by running real blockchain applications. However, the devices and services cost is a burden. In this paper, we aim to use continuoustime Markov chain (CTMC) models to simulate the time response of PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)-based healthcare blockchain network. Some influencing factors such as replica nodes delay and primary node delay will be analyzed. The simulation results also contribute to the optimization design of blockchain network.

AB Mockchain technology has received great attention in recent years. However, the data volume of blockchain grows continuously due to the features that cannot be deleted and can only be added. Currently, the total size of Bitcoin blockchain ledger has reached 200GB. Its high demand for storage space and bandwidth to synchronize data with the network prevents many nodes from joining the network. This is not only not conducive to the expansion of this decentralized network, but also becomes the bottleneck of the development of blockchain technolop% This paper proposes an IPFS-based blockchain data storage model to solve this problem. In this paper, the miners deposit the transaction data into the IPFS network and pack the returned IPFS hash of transaction into the block. Utilizing the characteristics of the IDES network and the features of the IPFS hash, the blockchain data is greatly reduced. The scheme is applied to the Bitcoin blockchain. According to the experimental results, the compression ratio can reach 0.0817. According to the analysis, it also has good performance in terms of security and synchronization speed of new node.

AB Cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) is challengeable due to lacking a trustworthy platform. This paper presents a witness model to credibly enforce the cloud service level agreement. Through introducing the witness role and using the blockchain based smart contract, we solve the trust issues about who can detect the service violation, how the violation is confirmed and the compensation is guaranteed. In this model, a verifiable consensus sortition algorithm proposed by us is firstly leveraged to select independent witnesses to form a witness committee. They are responsible for a specific service level agreement and get paid by monitoring and detecting service violation. Through carefully designing the witness' payoff function in the agreement, we further leverage game theory to analyze and prove that it is not the witness itself is trustworthy. Instead, the witness has to tell the truth because of its greedy nature, which is the desire to maximize its own revenue. As long as the service violation is confirmed by the witness committee, the compensation is automatically transferred to the customer by the smart contract. Finally, we implement a proof-of-concept prototype with the smart contract of Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates the feasibility of our model.

AB The Internet of Things aims at connecting everything ranging from individuals, organizations, companies to things in the physical and virtual world. The digital identity has always been considered as the keystone for all online services and the foundation for building security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. However, current literature still lacks of a comprehensive research on the digital identity management for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we identify digital identity challenges and solutions for the Internet in general. We then focus on how existing solutions cope with IoT requirements such as scalability, interoperability, mobility, security and privacy. We also investigate recent surging blockchain sovereign identity solutions and enumerate some projects and startups which are focusing on IoT identity problems. Furthermore, we elaborate challenges of building identity management systems for the IoT, including access control, privacy preserving, trust and performance respectively. At last, we conclude with the promising future research trends in building IoT identity management systems.

TI Using Scan Side Channel to Detect IP Theft
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATION (VLSI) SYSTEMS
AB In the growing heterogeneous Internet of Things market, which embraces a plurality of vendors and service providers, IP protection plays a central role. This paper proposes a process for the detection of IP theft in VLSI devices that exploits the internal test scan chains, designed for production test automation. The scan chains supply direct access to the internal registers in the device, enabling combinational analysis of the device logic. By using Boolean function learning methods, the learner creates a partial dependence graph of the internal flip-flops. The graph is further partitioned using the shared nearest neighbors graph clustering method, and individual blocks of combinational logic are isolated. These blocks can be matched with known building blocks that compose the original function. This enables reconstruction of the function implementation to the level of pipeline structure. The IP owner can compare the resulting structure with his own implementation to confirm whether an IP violation has occurred. We demonstrate the power of the presented approach with a test case of an open source Bitcoin SHA-256 accelerator, containing more than 80 000 registers. With the presented method, we discover the microarchitecture of the module, locate all the main components of the SHA-256 algorithm, and learn the module's flow control. In addition to the direct recognition of the IP content, we also demonstrate a combination of reverse engineering and watermark methods. We define a new watermark structure-pipeline-associated watermark (PAW), combined with pipeline stages that can be detected with the scan-based reverse engineering method.

TI Perspectives of Blockchain Technology, its Relation to the Cloud and its
   Potential Role in Computer Science Education
SO ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
AB Blockchain ledgers and the Cloud are a perfect match. On the one hand, there is an inherent requirement for multiple separate authentication nodes to validate every Blockchain transaction with each node requiring substantial encryption calculation capability. On the other hand, massive economies of scale can bring down the cost per transaction, and provide service continuity. Additionally, the Cloud provides a perfect incubator for proof-of-concept projects. This paper considers the future implications of Blockchain, as the concept of disintermediated trustless ledgers stimulates the imagination of computer scientists and innovators. The Cloud's role in implementing this new paradigm is also highlighted, as a new decentralized P2P-Cloud model. Finally, this paper discusses how Blockchain may be integrated into the university level computer science and information technology curriculum.

TI Plasmid purification by using a new naphthalene tripodal support
SO SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY
AB The aim of this work was to employ a new naphthalene tripodal support for the isolation of supercoiled (sc) isoform of plasmid (pDNA) from a native sample. This support is for the first time synthesized and used in pDNA purification.
   The naphthalene tripodal ligand was synthesized and characterized to assess its purity and subsequently immobilized onto an epoxy-activated Sepharose CL-6B, using mild conditions and resulting in a ligand density of 0.32 mmol naphthalene tripodal/g derivatized Sepharose CL-6B. The complete characterization of naphthalene tripodal Sepharose CL-6B support was performed by High Resolution Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS) NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental analysis. The affinity was measured by SPR biosensor between naphthalene tripodal ligand immobilized on the surface and sc pVAX1-LacZ and the K-D was 8.65 x 10(-8) +/- 1.0 x 10(-8) M in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, at T = 25 degrees C, indicating a high affinity. For comparison reasons, the affinity ligand 3,8-diamino-6-phenylphe nanthridine (DAPP) was also immobilized on the chip surface and the K-D for sc pVAX1-LacZ is lower than with naphthalene tripodal. Saturation transfer difference -nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (STD-NMR) experiments showed that the interactions between the naphthalene tripodal-Sepharose CL-6B and DAPP-Sepharose supports and the 5'-mononucleotides are mainly hydrophobic and pi-pi stacking. The isolation of sc pDNA isoform was achieved with low salt concentrations, using 95 mM NaCl in binding step and 550 mM NaCI in elution step at T = 4 degrees C and pH 8, thus reducing the economic and environmental impact.

TI Detection of Smoke-Induced Pulmonary Lesions by Hyperpolarized Xe-129
   Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging in Rat Models
SO MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE
AB Purpose: To demonstrate that hyperpolarized (HP) xenon diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) is able to detect smoke-induced pulmonary lesions in rat models.
   Methods: Multi-b DKI with hyperpolarized xenon was used for the first time in five smoke-exposed rats and five healthy rats. Additionally, DKI with b values of up to 80 s/cm(2) were used in two healthy rats to probe the critical b value (a limit beyond which the DKI cannot describe the non-Gaussian diffusion).
   Results: The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) and diffusion kurtosis (K-app) extracted by the DKI model revealed significant changes in the smoke-exposed rats compared with those in the control group (P = 0.027 and 0.039, respectively), exhibiting strong correlations with mean linear intercept (L-m) from the histology. Although the maximum b value was increased to 80 s/cm(2), the DKI could still describe the nonGaussian diffusion (R-2 > 0.97).
   Conclusion: DKI with hyperpolarized xenon exhibited sensitivity in the detection of pulmonary lesions induced by smoke, including moderate emphysema and small airway diseases. The critical b value was rarely exceeded in DKI of the lungs due to the limited gradient strength of the MRI scanner used in our study.

AB We warned the public more than 20 years ago that cryptoviral extortion would pose a major threat to users, a threat that has been realized with the advent of Bitcoin but largely neglected until recently. We believe that a reactive mindset along with group conformity are partly to blame for this oversight and, moreover, are negatively impacting secure systems research. This presents a recipe for disaster, for while cryptoviral extortion is wreaking havoc on the surface, covert cryptovirology attacks are likely gathering strength within the shadows.

TI Modulation of the Vault Protein-Protein Interaction for Tuning of
   Molecular Release
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Vaults are naturally occurring ovoid nanoparticles constructed from a protein shell that is composed of multiple copies of major vault protein (MVP). The vault-interacting domain of vault poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (INT) has been used as a shuttle to pack biomolecular cargo in the vault lumen. However, the interaction between INT and MVP is poorly understood. It is hypothesized that the release rate of biomolecular cargo from the vault lumen is related to the interaction between MVP and INT. To tune the release of molecular cargos from the vault nanoparticles, we determined the interactions between the isolated INT-interacting MVP domains (iMVP) and wild-type INT and compared them to two structurally modified INT: 15-amino acid deletion at the C terminus (INT Delta C15) and histidine substituted at the interaction surface (INT/DSA/3H) to impart a pH-sensitive response. The apparent affinity constants determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technology are 262 +/- 4 nM for iMVP/INT, 1800 +/- 160 nM for iMVP/INT Delta C15 at pH 7.4. The INT/DSA/3H exhibits stronger affinity to iMVP (K-Dapp = 24 nM) and dissociates at a slower rate than wild-type INT at pH 6.0.

TI BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY: PROMISES AND REALITIES OF THE YEAR 2017
SO QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB While the Internet is passing through a second era of development, companies and business environment are challenged by a disruptive technology: blockchain (BC), the platform underlying Bitcoin virtual currency. Considered a digital revolution, but in the same time a natural consequence of the Internet development, BC technology has deep implications for many companies. By now, BC-enabled projects crossed through multiple industries and services: banking, supply chain operations, real estate, insurance, healthcare, electronic health records, copyright, music, renewable energy, to name just a few. New BC-enabled projects are initiated mostly by leading IT and banking companies. The potential growth of the Internet of Things makes the BC technology come even closer and faster. In this paper we present the pros and cons for adopting BC technology and show some aspects of the current state in Romania.

SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB The central theme of this paper is that the development of a technology that is predicted to have a major impact on the way we transact with each other should be a matter where the needs of society at large are taken into account. Where the technology is one that emerges from the domain of the Internet, inclusivity becomes even more acute in order to avoid widening the already existing gap in reaping the digital dividend. With blockchain, the obligation could even be seen as a moral one, as blockchain is said to have the potential to negate the scope for the abuse of trust by states and institutions. This could be a game changer in areas such as public procurement and the conduct of elections where abuse can lead to the denial of essential resources and a concomitant loss of life, or to conflict and mass killings. Blockchain presents an opportunity for the Internet development community to claim a degree of recognition in the human rights realm by aiding civil intervention in areas where military intervention has been deemed inappropriate.

TI Money Talk and Conduct from Cowries to Bitcoin
SO SIGNS AND SOCIETY
AB What role do forms of money play in social life? What kinds of sociocultural variation do they exhibit? What variety of things do people do with varieties of money? How are activities involving money differentiated into registers of money conduct in specific times and places? How are specific forms of money conduct recognized and differentiated from other cultural routines by those who encounter them? It has long been understood that money is intimately linked to varied forms of discursive semiosis through which distinct forms of money are created and endowed with distinct use characteristics; that specific forms of money are readily linked to (or appropriated by) group-specific interests or ideologies; and that differences in types of money conduct readily differentiate social roles and relationships among persons and groups in social history. Yet the role of discursive semiosis in the existence and use of money is not well understood, a lacuna that links most descriptions of money to voicing structures (or discursive positionalities) that are not grasped for what they are by those who offer such descriptions (e.g., speaking like the State without knowing it). This article clarifies the role of discursive semiosis in the social life of money. It shows that such clarification is a prerequisite on ethnographic answers to the questions listed at the beginning of this abstract. It presents a comparative framework for reasoning about forms of money in forms of life.

TI The Taxing Challenge of Digital Currency
SO JOURNAL OF BANKING AND FINANCE LAW AND PRACTICE
AB The taxation of digital currency presents at least two key challenges: first, ascertaining its tax characterisation; and secondly, ensuring users' compliance with broader tax and regulatory laws. In 2014, the Australian Tax Office issued rulings concluding that bitcoin should be characterised as a commodity instead of as money or a medium of exchange, for purposes of the Australian Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other tax laws. After significant inquiries and policy debate, the government has moved this year to change the GST law, so as to treat digital currency like money for GST purposes. This article discusses the characterisation challenge and effects, with a particular focus on bitcoin as the most widely used digital currency. It explains how the different taxation of traditional money compared to digital currencies that perform a similar function results in anomalous tax outcomes, which are detrimental to Australian digital currency businesses and are likely to drive these businesses offshore. It considers the issues in light of the legal meaning of money and argues that a functional approach to the definition of money and a purposive approach to the legislation, drawing on international experience, supports the legislative reform proposed by the government. This reform will foster the development of bitcoin intermediaries in Australia, the existence of which is likely to be an essential part of a successful regulatory framework for digital currencies in future.

In this way, conferences help to instill and reinforce the values of the academic society. Logistics and supply chain scholars are increasingly targeted to join in the dialogue of different academic networks and attend conferences in tangential disciplines. This editorial speaks to the growing affinity for logistics and supply chain scholars in different disciplinary settings, yet underscores the CSCMP Annual Global Conference (AGC) and its Academic Research Symposium (ARS) as the premier forums for advancing the state of the art in supply chain scholarship and reinforcing the discipline's traditions and values.

TI Effect of diurnal photosynthetic activity on the fine structure of
   amylopectin from normal and waxy barley starch
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
AB The impact of diurnal photosynthetic activity on the fine structure of the amylopectin fraction of starch synthesized by normal barley (NBS) and waxy barley (WBS), the latter completely devoid of amylose biosynthesis, was determined following the cultivation under normal diurnal or constant light growing conditions. The amylopectin fine structures were analysed by characterizing its unit chain length profiles after enzymatic debranching as well as its phi,beta-limit dextrins and its clusters and building blocks after their partial and complete hydrolysis with alpha-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, respectively. Regardless of lighting conditions, no structural effects were found when comparing both the amylopectin sides chain distribution and the internal chain fragments of these amylopectins. However, the diurnally grown NBS and WBS both showed larger amylopectin clusters and these had lower branching density and longer average chain lengths than clusters derived from plants grown under constant light conditions. Amylopectin clusters from diurnally grown plants also consisted of a greater number of building blocks, and shorter inter-block chain lengths compared to clusters derived from plants grown under constant light. Our data demonstrate that the diurnal light regime influences the fine structure of the amylopectin component both in amylose and non-amylose starch granules. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI The impact of the distributed ledger technology on the Single Euro
   Payments Area development
SO EQUILIBRIUM-QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND ECONOMIC POLICY
AB Research background: The year 2016 ended the period of the migration from national payment services to the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA) instruments. At the same time, however, it has become apparent that some problems remained unresolved. Overcoming them requires finding suitable technological solutions. The potential of the distributed ledger technology (DLT) is currently being explored by the financial sector and its implementation may affect the SEPA schemes in a variety of dimensions.
   Purpose of the article: The aim of the article was to determine the potential impact that the DLT transfer to the banking sector may have on the functioning of the SEPA in the future. The paper presents SEPA's assumptions and the current status of the project as well as the DTL's concept. It describes the technology transfer implications for the banking industry and compares the SEPA schemes currently operating with those based on the DLT. It also indicates the opportunities and threats that are the consequence of the new technology implementation and examines their significance for the SEPA.
   Methods: In the article, a qualitative analysis is supplemented with a quantitative one. Elements of descriptive statistics have been used to characterize the functioning of the main pillars of the SEPA schemes. The final conclusions are based on the comparative analysis of the SEPA schemes and developed DLT applications.
   Findings & Value added: The existing problems might be solved by supplementing the SEPA payment schemes currently operating with the applications based on the DLT. The systems that will be subsequently developed will provide the required real-time processing and a global reach. They will also extend the functionalities of the SEPA schemes with the ability to transfer other currencies. The implementation of this technology will result not only in new financial products but, first of all, in creating new business models. Consequently, we may expect a modification of the currently operating SEPA schemes, based on their supplementation rather than total replacement in a short time frame.

TI Preparation and Evaluation of Celecoxib Nanoemulsion for Ocular Drug
   Delivery
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB Introduction: Poor bioavailability of drugs from ocular dosage forms is mainly due to the tear production, nonproductive absorption, transient residence time, and impermeability of corneal epithelium. The aim of the present study was to design, characterize of a novel nanoemulsion (NE) system as an ocular delivery system for celecoxib (CXB) and to evaluate its physicochemical characteristics and rabbit corneal permeability to enhance the penetration of the drug. Methods: CXB NEs were prepared by testing its solubility in oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants. Utilizing pseudoternary phase diagram, the optimum ratios were chosen and full factorial design was used with 3 variables at 2 levels for preparing eight formulations. The prepared NEs were evaluated regarding their viscosity, pH, particle size, differential scanning calorimetry thermograms, stability, in vitro drug release, and corneal rabbit permeability. Results and Discussion: The results showed that the mean droplet size range of NE formulations was in the range of 6.96-26.65 nm and pH was 6.5-6.9, respectively. Viscosity range was 118-245 cps. Drug release profile showed that 82.6% of the drug released in the 24 h of the experiment. The maximum and minimum drug permeated percentage through rabbit cornea was observed in NE component (NEC)-5 (15.73%) and NEC-1 (6.1%), respectively. All NE formulations with different compositions and properties significantly increased partitioning, flux, and permeability coefficient from rabbit cornea. Dapp and Papp parameters in NEC-3 and NEC-5 formulation were 0.0233 cm(2) h(-1), 0.13 cm/h, and 46.62, 7.23 times higher than those of control (CXB suspension, 1%), respectively. The flux (Jss) of CXB from NEC-5 was 0.65 mg cm(-2) h(-1), 21.68 times higher than those of control. Conclusion: This present study showed that any change in content and composition of NEs could be changed physicochemical properties and permeability parameters during drug permeation from NE formulations. The phenomenon may be due to alteration of the cornea structural changes in the presence of NECs.

TI Epitope mapping of a new anti-Tn antibody detecting gastric cancer cells
SO GLYCOBIOLOGY
AB Here, we introduce a novel scFv antibody, G2-D11, specific for two adjacent Tn-antigens (GalNAc-Ser/Thr) binding equally to three dimeric forms of the epitope, Ser-Thr, Thr-Thr and Thr-Ser. Compared to other anti-Tn reagents, the binding of G2-D11 is minimally influenced by the peptide structure, which indicates a high degree of carbohydrate epitope dominance and a low influence from the protein backbone. With a high affinity (K-Dapp = 1.3 x 10(-8) M) and no cross-reactivity to either sialyl-Tn epitope or blood group A antigens, scFv G2-D11 is an excellent candidate for a well-defined anti-Tn-antigen reagent. Detailed immunohistochemical evaluation of tissue sections from a cohort of 80 patients with gastric carcinoma showed in all cases positive tumor cells. The observed staining was localized to the cytoplasm and in some cases to the membrane, whereas the surrounding tissue was completely negative demonstrating the usefulness of the novel Tn-antigen binding antibody.

TI Lung adenocarcinoma: Assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor
   mutation status based on extended models of diffusion-weighted image
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB PurposeTo evaluate the diagnostic performance of extended models of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging to help differentiate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status in stage IIIA-IV lung adenocarcinoma.
   Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study had institutional research board approval and was HIPAA compliant. Preoperative extended DW imaging including intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) 3 Tesla MRI were retrospectively evaluated in 53 patients with pathologically confirmed non-early stage (IIIA-IV) lung adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutationsat exons 18-21 were determined by using polymerase chain reaction-based ARMS. Quantitative parameters (mean, kurtosis, skewness, 10(th) and 90(th) percentiles) of IVIM (true-diffusion coefficient D, pseudo-diffusion coefficient D*, and perfusion fraction f) and DKI (kurtosis value Kapp, kurtosis corrected diffusion coefficient Dapp) were calculated by outlining entire-volume histogram analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was constructed to determine the diagnostic performance of each parameter. Multivariate logistic regression was used to differentiate the probability of EGFR mutation status.
   ResultsTwenty-four of 53 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were EGFR mutations, which occurred most often in acinar (10 of 13 [76.9%]) and papillary predominant tumors (9 of 13 [69.2%]). Patients with EGFR mutation showed significant higher 10(th) percentile of D, lower D* value in terms of kurtosis, and lower K-app value in terms of mean, skewness, 10(th) and 90(th) percentiles (all P values<0.05). The 90(th) K-app showed significantly higher sensitivity (97%; P<0.05) and Az (0.817; P<0.05) value. Multivariate logistic regression showed 90(th) K-app was a independent factor for determining EGFR mutation with odds ratio -1.657.
   ConclusionMultiple IVIM and DKI parameters, especially the histogram 90(th) K-app value, helped differentiate EGFR mutation status in stage IIIA-IV lung adenocarcinoma. Level of Evidence: 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. MAGN. RESON. IMAGING 2017;46:281-289

TI Designing Virtual Currency Regulation in Japan: Lessons from the Mt Gox
   Case
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION
AB Almost two years after the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings against the Mt Gox bitcoin exchange, Japan has finally introduced its first regulation addressing virtual currencies with an amendment to the Payment Services Act. The new rules concerning virtual currency exchange service providers and the definition of virtual currencies can certainly be considered as a step towards better regulation; however, several kinds of problems concerning virtual currencies that have arisen during the course of debate remain unsolved. First, there is the question of the nature of virtual currencies and their legal status. Secondly, the regulations applicable to financial actors operating in virtual currencies must be examined. Thirdly, issues regarding customer/user protection, which came to light as a result of the Mt Gox case, must be taken into consideration. Some have also pointed out the threat virtual currencies may pose to monetary policy. Regulatory issues that have arisen from the discussion on virtual currency regulation have already shown that whatever virtual currencies may prove to be, the effects they are causing and those affected by them are far from virtual.

TI A Study of the Curing and Flammability Properties of Bisphenol A Epoxy
   Diacrylate Resin Utilizing a Novel Flame Retardant Monomer,
   bis[di-acryloyloxyethyl]-p-tert-butyl-phenyl Phosphate
SO MATERIALS
AB A UV-curable, flame-retardant monomer, DAPP (bis[di-acryloyloxyethyl]-p-tert-butyl-phenyl-phosphate), was synthesized based on BPDCP (4-tert-butylphenyl-dichloro phosphate) and HEA (2-hydroxy ethyl acrylate). DAPP was blended with regular bisphenol A epoxy acrylate (BAEA) in various ratios to yield various phosphorus contents. The TGA-IR (thermogravimetric analyzer interface with an infrared spectrometer) results demonstrate that compounding 30 mol % DAPP with BAEA significantly reduced the amount of released CO gas. In contrast, the peak intensity of CO2 is independent of phosphorus content. The limiting oxygen index (LOI), reaching the saturated value of 26, and the heat release rate (HRR) measured using a cone-calorimeter, 156.43 KW/m(2), confirm the saturation point when 30 mol % DAPP was compounded into BAEA. A study of the kinetics of pyrolysis reveals that E-a decreases as the phosphorus content increases. Both the TGA-IR and pyrolysis results reveal that the phosphorus compound DAPP is easily decomposed during the initial stage of burning to form an insulating layer, which inhibits further burning of the resin and the consequent release of other flammable gases.

AB A Cloud federation is a collaboration of organizations sharing data hosted on their private cloud infrastructures in order to exploit a common business opportunity. However, the adoption of cloud federations is hindered by member organizations' concerns on sharing their data with potentially competing organizations. For cloud federations to be viable, federated organizations' privacy concerns should be alleviated by providing mechanisms that allow organizations to control which users from other federated organizations can access which data. We propose the architecture of a novel identity and access management system part of FaaS, a cloud federation service developed by the H2020 SUNFISH project. Our system allows federated organizations to enforce attribute-based access control policies on their data in a privacy-preserving fashion. Users are granted access to federated data when their identity attributes match the policies, but without revealing their attributes in clear. The architecture relies on two novel technologies, blockchain and Intel SGX hardware platform to guarantee integrity of the policy evaluation process.

AB Current trade is being heavily influenced by emerging technologies. Despite many technological advances, logistics management is at a standstill about the improvements communication systems. Updating information during the whole process is an essential element in such systems but trust in that information is even more important. For this reason, providing a mechanism that can be verified and that allows increasing the level of trust of the stakeholders could contribute to the improvement of the logistic process. The main aim of this paper is to show an analysis of the current state of blockchain technology and its possibilities regarding the development of decentralized and self-verifiable applications focusing on their integrity. Besides, a new concept of program is defined thanks to the use of a set of smart contracts which should be deployed over the Ethereum blockchain.

TI Locally Simple Models Construction: Methodology and Practice
SO BULLETIN OF IRKUTSK STATE UNIVERSITY-SERIES MATHEMATICS
AB One of the most notable trends associated with the Fourth industrial revolution is a significant strengthening of the role played by semantic methods. They are engaged in artificial intelligence means, knowledge mining in huge flows of big data, robotization, and in the internet of things. Smart contracts also can be mentioned here, although the ' intelligence' of smart contracts still needs to be seriously elaborated. These trends should inevitably lead to an increased role of logical methods working with semantics, and significantly expand the scope of their application in practice. However, there are a number of problems that hinder this process.
   We are developing an approach, which makes the application of logical modeling efficient in some important areas. The approach is based on the concept of locally simple models and is primarily focused on solving tasks in the management of enterprises, organizations, governing bodies. The most important feature of locally simple models is their ability to replace software systems. Replacement of programming by modeling gives huge advantages, for instance, it dramatically reduces development and support costs. Modeling, unlike programming, preserves the explicit semantics of models allowing integration with artificial intelligence and robots. In addition, models are much more understandable to general people than programs.
   In this paper we propose the implementation of the concept of locally simple modeling on the basis of so-called document models, which has been developed by us earlier. It is shown that locally simple modeling is realized through document models with finite submodel coverages. In the second part of the paper an example of using document models for solving a management problem of real complexity is demonstrated.

AB Ubiquitous learning environments have an increasing trend considering the huge number of connected smart devices dedicated to educational services. Ubiquitous learning (U-learning) provides to students the possibility to learn at anyplace and anytime within the collaborative environment using interactive multimedia system that enables effective communication among teacher and learners. The architecture of ubiquitous learning environment (ULE) still suffers from the problems of vulnerability. Blockchain (BC) technology recently explored to provide much more privacy and security using essentially peer-to-peer (P2P) networks has a significant role in the development of decentralized topologies. This paper expounds a novel BC-based architecture for ULE that preserves the benefits of security and privacy. The architecture offers new opportunities to design secured collaborative learning system. It provides data exchange with BC using trust methods within the decentralized topology. The evaluation of this implemented system demonstrates its efficiency while it delivers security and privacy for ULE.

AB The scientific community is facing a crisis of reproducibility: confidence in scientific results is damaged by concerns regarding the integrity of experimental data and the analyses applied to that data. Experimental integrity can be compromised inadvertently when researchers overlook some important component of their experimental procedure, or intentionally by researchers or malicious third-parties who are biased towards ensuring a specific outcome of an experiment. The scientific community has pushed for "open science" to add transparency to the experimental process, asking researchers to publicly register their data sets and experimental procedures. We argue that the software engineering community can leverage its expertise in tracking traceability and provenance of source code and its related artifacts to simplify data management for scientists. Moreover, by leveraging smart contract and blockchain technologies, we believe that it is possible for such a system to guarantee end-to-end integrity of scientific data and results while supporting collaborative research.

AB A blockchain is an institutional technology-a protocol-that allows for economic coordination between agents separated by boundaries of possible mistrust. Blockchains are not the only technology in history to have these characteristics. The paper looks at the role of the diplomatic protocol at the very beginning of human civilisation in the ancient near east. These two protocols-diplomatic and blockchain-have significant similarities. They were created to address to similar economic problems using similar mechanisms: a permanent record of past dealings, public and ritualistic verification of transactions, and game-theoretic mechanisms of reciprocity. The development of the diplomatic protocol allowed for the creation of the first international community and facilitated patterns of peaceful trade and exchange. Some questions about a generalised 'protocol economics' are drawn.

AB Almost every traveller possesses some amount of leftover foreign currency, either as actual cash or on a travel currency card, at the end of any international trip. However, the means to exchange this leftover currency, coins in particular, is largely inconvenient often leading to considerable amounts discarded or left unused. In this paper, we explore how distributed ledger technology, i.e. blockchain, could be applied to the problem of utilizing this leftover foreign currency. We portray here the drawbacks of the existing systems of foreign currency exchange and delineate the requirements of a potential mobile web application for exchanging this currency by integrating smart kiosk based systems, particularly for handling cash, with a peer-to-peer currency exchange technique based on blockchain that could help to bring such currency back into circulation efficiently.

AB Modern loT solutions are often an intricate system of interdependent components. Traditional monitoring techniques may not be sufficient to ensure the correct operation of those systems. We present an on-line machine learning approach for anomaly detection that is optimized for interpretability. The aim is to make it as intuitive as possible for human operators to derive insights about the system. To this end we combine characteristics of the system into sets of features that can be rendered graphically. Our solution builds on open source components and applies to any time series of numerical data. This work originated within a larger project on connected mobility that uses Blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity. Hence we demonstrate some results at the example of the public Ethereum blockchain. Further work will extend the solution to more general sensor data from the loT realm.

AB The Cloud computing paradigm is built on the concept of virtualization, allowing multiple virtual machines to cohabit on one physical device to enable the scaling up and down of applications through elastic on-demand provisioning. More recently containers e.g. Docker, have been shown to enable a more lightweight mechanism than hypervisors and proved to be a viable alternative for virtualization, based on shared operating systems. The advent of such lightweight environments has brought a multitude of application uses in research, science and industry, enabling pre-configured operating environments to be shared, reused and instantiated on demand. The sharing of containers has currently been exposed using centralized repositories (e.g. Dockerhub), which allows containers to be shared and to form the building blocks for further development. In this paper, we take a look at the next evolution of this lifecycle and consider whether it is viable to securely share container-based applications within a decentralized group of individuals and to provide an audit trail recording exactly who has shared what, and with whom. For this purpose we consider the use of Blockchain technologies, and consequently perform a comparative analysis of Blockchain technologies for this use case. The paper provides mostly a review and taxonomy of different ledger systems, which we believe may be of interest to the SafeData Workshop participants.

AB A recent report from the German Energy Agency analyzes the possible introduction of the blockchain technology in energy transactions in power distribution. The issue deserves attention since the extensive digitalization of business models puts new challenges to utilities in the power sector. The German decision makers in the energy field claim that blockchain appears as a close perspective and, at the same time, the Gartner hypecycle puts this technology at the peak of inflated expectations in 2016. Diffuse perception however provides hints for further investigation on the topic. This paper provides insight into the problem of peer-to-peer energy exchange from a technical perspective, providing evidence about an impossible guarantee for the so-called 'transparency' in energy transactions. A generic customer that buys energy from his neighbor that produces clean energy cannot have any guarantee about the origin of the energy he consumes, since it depends from the voltage distribution across the network. This assumption is even more realistic when different generation sources are distributed in the power distribution network, providing also voltage regulation services. It will be proved through some easy examples that, differently from other digital business models, such as Airbnb and Uber, the physical asset here plays a crucial role that cannot so easily be neglected.

AB Program code stored on the Ethereum blockchain is considered immutable, but this does not imply that its control flow cannot be modified. This bears the risk of loopholes whenever parties encode binding agreements in smart contracts. In order to quantify the issue, we define a heuristic indicator of control flow immutability, evaluate it based on a call graph of all smart contracts deployed on Ethereum, and find that two out of five smart contracts require trust in at least one third party. Besides, the analysis reveals that significant parts of the Ethereum blockchain are interspersed with debris from past attacks against the platform. We leverage the call graph to develop a method for data cleanup, which allows for less biased statistics of Ethereum use in practice.

AB Peer-to-peer (P2P) design offers many benefits over a single-master or a multi-master architecture in terms of scalability, reliability and independence. The Clondike project is being converted from a grid computing system into a universal non-dedicated P2P cluster where every participating node can benefit from its membership in the cluster. But different design requires different types of algorithms in order to guarantee the same functionality.
   One of the challenges in P2P design is a fair scheduling and a general protection of the whole cluster against abusive or malfunctioning nodes. Algorithms used in a single-master or multi-master clusters do not work anymore. We have designed a multi-level system based on one of the main principles of cryptocurrencies to achieve a distributed master-less reputation rating across the cluster.
   This paper discusses proposed cluster multi-level reputation system and its parameters. The system is evaluated on a Clondike cluster on an experimental measurement with abusive nodes involved.

TI Personalizing EU Private Law: From Disclosures to Nudges and Mandates
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB A key problem in EU private law is actor heterogeneity. While special rules exist for certain subgroups of actors, for example consumers or retail investors, the members of these legal categories still exhibit vast differences in behaviour, degrees of rationality, vulnerability, and economic endowment. Therefore, private law stands much to gain from tailoring its regulatory apparatus to the individual addressees. This article draws on behavioural economics and Big Data analytics to develop a comprehensive framework for the personalization of EU private law across different regulatory tools such as disclosures, nudges, and mandates. Hitherto, in market settings, data mining techniques have almost exclusively been used by tech-savvy companies. The time seems ripe for lawmakers to use digital technologies in order to take European market regulation one step further. By harnessing Big Data techniques, laws can be tailored to individual characteristics of addressees; the relevant parameters could then be stored and updated in a 'legal blockchain'. Through the use of different metrics and pseudonymization, the right to privacy, a key feature of European law in the digital age, can ultimately be respected. The article shows how laws can be personalized in a variety of different settings. Examples range from the salience and complexity of disclosures in consumer and investment law, to default caps on overdraft charges, debiasing optimism bias, and usury laws. Finally, it is argued that personalization can inspire a novel theory of legal categories which transcends the traditional, status-based dichotomies of, for example, 'consumer-seller' or 'retail-professional investor'. By providing a tool for making empirical distinctions, which affect the impact of laws, legally relevant, personalization thus ultimately serves equality before the law.

AB Transactive energy paradigms will enable the exchange of energy from a distributed set of prosumers. While prosumers have access to distributed energy resources, these resources are intermittently available. There is a need for distributed markets to enable the exchange of energy in transactive environments, however, the large number of potential prosumers introduces challenges in the establishment of trust between prosumers. Markets for transactive environments create other challenges, such as establishing clearing prices for energy and exchanging money between prosumers. Blockchains provide a unique technology to address this distributed trust problem through the use of a distributed ledger, cryptocurrencies, and the execution of smart contracts. This paper introduces a smart contract that implements a transactive energy auction that operates without the need for a trusted entitys oversight. The auction mechanism implements a Vickrey second price auction, which guarantees bidders will submit honest bids. The contract is implemented on transactive agents on the WSU campus interacting with a 72kW PV array and the Ethereum blockchain. The contract is then used to execute auctions based on the energy from the the PV array and simulated building loads to demonstrate the auctions operations.

AB A revolutionary trustable sharable computing outcome, the blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions originated from digital events and shared among participating parties within a computing framework. Each transaction of the chain in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system and its constituents. Once recorded, information can never be erased and neither altered. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made during the business operations. In general sense, the blockchain could be described simply as being a way of storing the information of a transaction, between multiple parties in a trustable way. Recording, sharing, storing and redistributing contents in a secure and decentralized way. Being owned, run and monitored by everybody and without anyone controlling it. Besides, avoiding any kind of modifications or abuses from a central authority. Blockchain technology is non-controversial and has worked flawlessly over the last few years and is being successfully applied to both financial and non-financial world applications and listed as as the most important invention since the Internet itself. Besides, digital transformation is taking off as rapid agent for change as part of the global business convergence. In this article, detail of blockchain technologies is presented from the perspectives of digital business transformation along with its future evolutions.

AB The purpose of this article is to discuss the application of blockchain technology in e-government, particularly in the Chinese context. Chancheng District, part of Foshan City in Guangdong Province, China, has undertaken a project called "The Comprehensive Experimental Area of Big Data in Guangdong Province" since 2016. Promoting the application of blockchain technology in e-government is an essential part of this undertaking, which is the first use of blockchain in government in China. Taking Chancheng's project as a case study, this article analyzes the framework, difficulties and challenges of applying blockchain to e-government at present, and discusses how blockchain technology can contribute to the development of e-government and public services in China. This article considers the practical realities in China and discusses the application of blockchain technology in Chinese e government, finding that blockchain technology can bring the following benefits: (1) improvements in the quality and quantity of government services, (2) greater transparency and accessibility of government information, (3) development of information-sharing across different organizations, and (4) assistance in building an individual credit system in China. However, information security, cost and reliability are still major problems in application. Thus, establishing a general application platform of blockchain technology and developing management standards are crucial for promoting and applying blockchain in e-government. Blockchain provides an effective way of making government services more efficient, but standardizing the management system, processes and responsibility for the application is necessary for its further promotion. This article, by providing an analysis of the practice of blockchain in e government in China, could serve as a foundation for further practical work and theoretical research in government services.

SO MODELING IDENTIFICATION AND CONTROL
AB In this paper a novel feedback controller and stability analysis of a blockchain implementation is developed by using a control engineering perspective. The controller output equals the difficulty adjustment in the mining process while the feedback variable is the average block time over a certain time period. The computational power (hash rate) of the miners is considered a disturbance in the model. The developed controller is tested against a simulation model with constant disturbance, step and ramp responses as well as with a high-frequency sinusoidal disturbance. Stability and a fast response is demonstrated in all these cases with a controller which adjusts it's output at every new block. Finally the performance of the controller is implemented and demonstrated on a testnet with a constant hash rate as well as on the mainnet of a public open source blockchain project.

AB Volunteering is an indispensable cornerstone of our society, covering nearly every part of our life, from social care to emergency management and education. This omnipresence of volunteering led to a plethora of volunteer management systems (VMS), mainly supporting NPOs in scheduling and allocating tasks to volunteers. In contrast to this NPO-centric approach of existing VMS, we focus on volunteers by investigating the following core question: "How can the engagement of volunteers be digitized and exploited in a life-long way". To provide a first step towards answering this question, the contribution of this paper is threefold. First, an in-depth study of related approaches is provided identifying shortcomings but also promising concepts. Second, challenges which have to be tackled to deal with the broad spectrum and peculiarities of volunteering are identified and a vision for a next-generation VMS called iVOLUNTEER is pointed out. Third, promising technologies are identified and discussed in detail to lay the basis for the technical architecture of our envisioned iVOLUNTEER-prototype.

AB In this work, we propose a blockchain verification protocol as a method for enabling and securing spectrum sharing in cognitive radio networks. The spectrum-sharing mechanism is used as a medium access protocol for accessing wireless bandwidth among competing cognitive radios. We introduce a virtual currency, called "Specoins", for payment to access spectrum. An auction mechanism based on a first-come-first-served queue is used, with the price for the spectrum advertised by each primary user in a decentralized fashion. The blockchain protocol facilitates the transactions between primary and secondary users, and is used to validate and save each user's virtual wallet. The blockchain also serves as a distributed database that is visible by all participating parties and any node can volunteer to update the blockchain. The volunteer nodes are called miners and they are awarded with Specoins. We propose diverse methods to exchange the Specoins in order to make leasing possible even by cognitive radios that are not miners. We show the improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to the conventional Aloha medium access protocol in terms of spectrum usage.

AB In this paper, a new firmware verification scheme is presented that utilizes blockchain technologies for securing network embedded devices. In the proposed scheme, an embedded device requests a firmware verification to nodes connected in a blockchain network and gets a response whether its firmware is up-to-date or not. If not latest, the embedded device can securely download and install the latest firmware from a firmware update server. Even in the case that the version of the firmware is up-to-date, its integrity is checked via the blockchain nodes. The proposed scheme guarantees that the embedded device's firmware is not tampered and latest. The effects of attacks targeting known vulnerabilities are thus minimized.

AB The design and development of novel security and authentication protocols is a challenging task. Design flaws, security and privacy issues as well as incomplete specifications pose risks for its users. Authcoin is a blockchain-based validation and authentication protocol for secure identity assurance. Formal methods, such as Colored Petri Nets (CPNs), are suitable to design, develop and analyze such new protocols in order to detect flaws and mitigate identified security risks. In this work, the Authcoin protocol is formalized using Colored Petri Nets resulting in a verifiable CPN model. An Agent-Oriented Modeling (AOM) methodology is used to create goal models and corresponding behavior models. Next, these models are used to derive the Authcoin CPN models. The modeling strategy as well as the required protocol semantics are explained in detail. Furthermore, we conduct a state-space analysis on the resulting CPN model and derive specific model properties. The result is a complete and correct formal specification that is used to guide future implementations of Authcoin.

AB Very few ecommerce participants are observed to be satisfied with ecommerce-raised business expenses, profit sharing, fake products, or user privacy. In this article, a new ecommerce concept, i.e., Balanced Commerce, is proposed to address the concerns through innovative trading paradigms and principles. The balanced ecommerce promotes direct trades with no intermediary merchants, public and sharing resources and services, and smart broker-based business activities to assure the fairness and reduce business expenses. To implement the principles and features of the balanced ecommerce, a reference model has been developed. To identify how balanced an ecommerce system is, a balanced indicator and associated algorithms have been developed. Based on the reference model and identified features, a balanced ecommerce model, i.e., Individual - Individual (I2I), has been developed. An I2I ecommerce system is featured with an individual-oriented cloud browser to support independent trading, and a public creditworthiness cloud to provide basic and tracing data of individuals and commodities, along with smart brokering services. A number of I2I ecommerce systems have been developed and some put into practice. Three of them are described to testify the values and feasibility of the balanced ecommerce.

AB In this paper, we propose a decentralized identity management system based on Blockchain. The function of the system mainly includes identity authentication and reputation management. The technical advantages of the Blockchain makes the data in the system safe and credible. In addition, we use smart contracts to write system rules to ensure the reliability of user information. We bind the user's entity information with the public key address and determine the true identity of a virtual user on the Blockchain. We use the token to represent the reputation which is shown to be an effective reputation model, making the participants in the system prefer to maintain and manage their personal reputation. Our system makes it possible for users to securely manage their identity and reputation on the Internet.

AB The innovative ideas behind blockchain offer exciting perspectives in research and development of electronic distributed ledger technologies. Bitcoin introduced an "eventual consistency" blockchain with the apparent intent of providing an open and inclusive system for secure, anonymous, yet cost-effective financial transactions based on peer-to-peer computing. It uses Proof of Work as a cryptographic puzzle to control growth of a chain and to strengthen the resiliency of a chain against subsequent rewrite attempts.
   Commercial sectors and the public sector have realized the potential of this technical approach, and we now see a number of blockchains that may be called private, closed or permissioned - and that may eschew the values inherent in the design of Bitcoin type systems. From a value-neutral research perspective, there are no clear definitions of blockchain attributes such as "private" or "permissioned", nor is there typically a good understanding of the trust assumptions that clients must make when using such services - for example in systems that do not rely on Proof of Work but on a limited and controlled set of consensus-creating agents. We believe that more research in this direction could establish firm foundations for domain-specific or coalition-specific blockchains, and that such underpinnings would offer novel trust architectures beyond those provided by completely open/public blockchains and third-party operated, closed/private blockchains.

AB We propose the formal study of blockchains that are owned and controlled by organizations and that neither create cryptocurrencies nor provide incentives to solvers of cryptographic puzzles. We view such approaches as frameworks in which system parts, such as the cryptographic puzzle, may be instantiated with different technology. Owners of such a blockchain procure puzzle solvers as resources they control, and use a mathematical model to compute optimal parameters for the cryptographic puzzle mechanism or other parts of the blockchain. We illustrate this approach with a use case in which blockchains record hashes of financial process transactions to increase their trustworthiness and that of their audits. For Proof of Work as cryptographic puzzle, we develop a detailed mathematical model to derive MINLP optimization problems for computing optimal Proof of Work configuration parameters that trade off potentially conflicting aspects such as availability, resiliency, security, and cost in this governed setting. We demonstrate the utility of such a mining calculus by applying it on some instances of this problem. We hope that our work may facilitate the creation of domain-specific blockchains for a wide range of applications such as trustworthy information in Internet of Things systems and bespoke improvements of legacy financial services.

TI Bitcoin Mining Using Maxeler Dataflow Computers
SO ELEKTROTEHNISKI VESTNIK-ELECTROCHEMICAL REVIEW
AB "Bitcoin mining" is an important and integral part of Bitcoin, the first decentralized payment network. "Miners" secure the Bitcoin network by confirming "bitcoin transactions" and in return they receive a certain amount of "digital coins" bitcoins. Bitcoin mining is a repetitive and highly parallel process, which makes it suitable for parallel computing. In this paper we present dataflow computing with Maxeler dataflow computers. We implemented and tested our own dataflow bitcoin miner on two Maxeler dataflow computers MAX2336B (MAX2B) and MAX4848A (MAIA), and achieved speedups of up to 102 times and up to 256 times higher energy efficiency compared to general multi-core CPUs. The Maxeler dataflow computers cannot compete against specialized ASIC bitcoin mining rigs that are at least 1000 times faster and at least 100 times more energy-efficient; but the Maxeler dataflow computers can be reprogrammed for other computational tasks while the ASIC mining rigs usually become outdated in only a few months.

TI Distributed ledger technology in payments, clearing and settlement
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
AB Digital innovations in finance, loosely known as "fintech", have garnered a great deal of attention across the financial industry. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is one such innovation that has been cited as a means of transforming payment, clearing and settlement (PCS) processes, including how funds are transferred and how securities, commodities and derivatives are cleared and settled. An important goal of this paper is to examine how this technology might be used in the area of PCS, and to identify both the opportunities and challenges facing its practical implementation and possible long-term adoption. DLT has the potential to provide new ways of transferring and recording the ownership of digital assets; immutably and securely storing information; providing for identity management; and facilitating other evolving operations through peer-to-peer networking, access to a distributed but common ledger among participants and cryptography. Potential use cases in PCS include cross-border payments and the post-trade clearing and settlement of securities. These use cases could address operational and financial frictions around existing services. Nonetheless, the industry's understanding and application of this technology is still in its infancy, and stakeholders are taking a variety of approaches toward its development. Given the technology's early stage, a number of challenges to development and adoption remain, including how issues around business cases, technological hurdles, legal considerations and risk management considerations are addressed. To understand fast-moving developments in this area, a team of Federal Reserve staff conducted a series of discussions with approximately thirty organizations, including financial institutions, financial market infrastructures, technology start-ups, established technology firms and other government agencies.

AB This keynote paper addresses existing problems with traditional non-machine readable contracts that are based on trust. Such contracts have mostly a ceremonial purpose between transacting business parties and when conflicts occur, traditional contracts are often not enforcible. On the other hand, so called smart contracts that are machine readable and supported by blockchain-technology transactionalities, do not require qualitative trust between contracting parties as blockchain establish instead a quantitative notion of trust. However, currently existing smart-contract solutions that equip the protocol layer on top of blockchains with Turing-complete programming languages, lead to the false claim by industry practitioners they can manage smart contracts successfully. Instead, it is important to start considering the currently missing application layer for smart contracts.

AB Cryptocurrencies became popular with the emergence of Bitcoin and have shown an unprecedented growth over the last few years. As of November 2016, more than 720 cryptocurrencies exist, with Bitcoin still being the most popular one. We show the statistical properties of the most important cryptocurrencies. We characterize their exchange rates versus the US Dollar by fitting parametric distributions to them, including the Student t distribution, the generalized hyperbolic distribution as well as the asymmetric normal inverse Gaussian and the asymmetric variance gamma distribution. Our findings show that cryptocurrencies exhibit strong non-normal characteristics, with standard heavy-tailed distributions such as the Student t distribution giving good descriptions of the data. This is the first study that looks at the parametric distribution of cryptocurreny returns. The results are important for investment and risk management purposes.

AB Cryptocurrency trade is now a popular type of investment. Cryptocurrency market has been treated similar to foreign exchange and stock market. However, because of its volatility, there's a need for a prediction tool for investors to help them consider investment decisions for cryptocurrency trade. Nowadays, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) computing based tools are commonly used in stock and foreign exchange market predictions. There has been much research about ANN predictor on stocks and foreign exchange as case studies but none on cryptocurrency. Therefore, this research studied variety of ANN method to predict the market value of one of the most used cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. The ANN methods will be used to develop model to predict the close value of Bitcoin in the next day (next day prediction). This study compares four ANN methods, namely backpropagation neural network (BPNN), genetic algorithm neural network (GANN), genetic algorithm backpropagation neural network (GABPNN), and neuro-evolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT). The methods are evaluated based on accuracy and complexity. The result of the experiment showed that BPNN is the best method with MAPE 1.998 +/- 0.038 % and training time 347 +/- 63 seconds.

AB Existing distributed ledger implementations - specifically, several blockchain implementations - embody a cacophony of divergent capabilities augmenting innovations of cryptographic hashes, consensus mechanisms, and asymmetric cryptography in a wide variety of applications. Whether specifically designed for cryptocurrency or otherwise, several distributed ledgers rely upon modular mechanisms such as consensus or smart contracts. These components, however, can vary substantially among implementations; differences involving proof-of-work, practical byzantine fault tolerance, and other consensus approaches exemplify distinct distributed ledger variations. Such divergence results in unique combinations of modules, performance, latency, and fault tolerance. As implementations continue to develop rapidly due to the emerging nature of blockchain technologies, this paper encapsulates a snapshot of sensor and internet of things (IoT) specific implementations of blockchain as of the end of 2016. Several technical risks and divergent approaches preclude standardization of a blockchain for sensors and IoT in the foreseeable future; such issues will be assessed alongside the practicality of IoT applications among Hyperledger, Iota, and Ethereum distributed ledger implementations suggested for IoT. This paper contributes a comparison of existing distributed ledger implementations intended for practical sensor and IoT utilization. A baseline for characterizing distributed ledger implementations in the context of IoT and sensors is proposed. Technical approaches and performance are compared considering IoT size, weight, and power limitations. Consensus and smart contracts, if applied, are also analyzed for the respective implementations' practicality and security. Overall, the maturity of distributed ledgers with respect to sensor and IoT applicability will be analyzed for enterprise interoperability.

AB Supply chains can be seen as cyber-physical networks grounded on object identification and tracking. Conventional trust models featuring centralized information management architectures and simplistic things classification lend two of the most relevant limitations to current solutions. Blockchain introduces novel and a valuable trust approaches while semantic technologies better permit a things description. This paper introduces a semantic-enhanced blockchain platform allowing a flexible object discovery. It is based on validation by consensus of smart contracts and adopt a semantic matchmaking between queries and object annotations expressed w.r.t. ontology models. Early experiments assess the good behaviour of the proposed framework.

AB Integrative various distributed generation in energy infrastructure have brought great opportunities in recent years. However, this integration has also led to critical challenges in energy management, such as congestion pricing and non-optimality of dispatch. To address these challenges, deregulation and decentralization of electricity market is one of the effective solutions. Although various deregulation schemes have been proposed in recent years, there still remain some serious challenges in achieving resilient management of real-time energy deregulation especially in the presence of disasters. To counter this issue, in this paper, we propose a model for a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) transactive microgrid where prosumers (Producer/ Consumer) can trade local generation with each other via a smart management system. Furthermore, in our proposed model, the energy trading is executed in a decentralized manner by leveraging Blockchain technologies. Among different Blockchain technologies, we adopt the Ethereum Blockchain in our work. The auction models for energy trading are proposed by incorporating a smart contract that is the essential component of the Blockchain. In our simulations, the proposed P2P energy trading model is evaluated.

AB Blockchain is a distributed, transparent, immutable ledger. Consensus protocol forms the core of blockchain. They decide how a blockchain works. With the advent of new possibilities in blockchain technology, researchers are keen to find a well-optimized Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol. Creating a global consensus protocol or tailoring a cross-platform plug and play software application for implementation of various consensus protocols are ideas of huge interest. Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) is considered to be a global consensus protocol and promises to be Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) by bringing with it the concept of quorum slices and federated byzantine fault tolerance. This consensus's working and its comparison with other protocols that were earlier proposed are analyzed here. Also, hyperledger an open-source project by Linux Foundation which includes implementing the concept of practical byzantine fault tolerance and also a platform where various other consensus protocols and blockchain applications can be deployed in a plug and play manner is also being discussed here. This paper focuses on analyzing these consensus protocols already proposed and their feasibility and efficiency in meeting the characteristics they propose to provide.

AB Blockchain technology realizes unforgeable and decentralized ledger by applying P2P network, cryptography and consensus mechanism over distributed network. Its security relies on all of these technologies. One of fundamental problem of the security of blockchain technology is compromise of underlying cryptographic algorithms. This paper shows the impact of compromise of underlying cryptography and the way to extend the validity of blockchain applying the long-term signature scheme which was standardized in ETSI. The long-term signature scheme assume the existence of centralized PKI and secure time-stamp service. In this paper, we propose a method to apply similar concept and data structure with de-centralized manner. Our scheme avoids hard-fork of original blockchain, in the case of compromise of hash function and provides smooth-fork in the case of compromise of digital signature scheme.

AB P2P-based M2M application frameworks have several advantages, such as increased flexibility, efficiency and a lack of single point of failure as compared to centralised approaches. However, there are several security drawbacks which need to be addressed in order to provide the user a secure environment for the provision and usage of M2M applications. This publication presents different security issues inside P2Pbased M2M application frameworks and evaluates P2P protocols based on security. In order to avoid different security attacks, the concept of trust and its importance are emphasized. Furthermore, a trust management system with special trust metric parameters is presented which considers the architecture of P2P-based M2M applications. Finally, blockchain principles are integrated for optimising the overall security in the system by improving data storage between peers, avoiding volatility of peers and ensuring correct working M2M applications.

AB The Intelligent vehicle (IV) is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from many security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable to provide secure IV communication. The major issues in IV communication are trust, data accuracy and reliability of communication data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV Communication. In this paper, we introduce an Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point (IV-TP) mechanism for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. The IVs comm unicated data provides security and reliability using our proposed IV-TP. This IV-TP mechanism introduced in the paper provides trustworthiness for vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. The introduced reward-based system is an exchange of some IV-TP among IVs, during successful communication.

AB Military operations enabled using networks involves generation, transmission, collection and analysis of mission critical data to enable better decision making capabilities to commanders at all levels to achieve the objectives. This data is generated by variety of heterogeneous elements like humans and equipment in the battlefield. It is of utmost importance to ensure high level of integrity, confidentiality and availability of this data in such an environment and to ensure its sustainability in hostile environments. This paper presents scope and detailed analysis of the idea of utilizing Blockchain technology as a viable solution for ensuring integrity and provenance of data to suit military operations using networks and maintaining sustainability of these networks. The core concepts of Blockchain are presented in a comprehensive manner along with its variations. Military operations enabled using networks are modeled using Network Enabled Military Operations (NEMO) model. The viable framework and architecture for incorporating Blockchain technology to suit security requirements has been analyzed using three case studies relevant in today's scenario.

AB Traditional ACID transactions, typically supported by relational database management systems, emphasize database consistency. BASE provides a model that trades some consistency for availability, and is typically favored by cloud systems and NoSQL data stores. With the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, another alternative to both ACID and BASE is introduced: SALT. In this keynote paper, we present SALT as a model to explain blockchains and their use in application architecture. We take both, a transaction and a transaction processing systems perspective on the SALT model. From a transactions perspective, SALT is about Sequential, Agreed-on, Ledgered, and Tamper-resistant transaction processing. From a systems perspective, SALT is about decentralized transaction processing systems being Symmetric, Admin-free, Ledgered and Time-consensual. We discuss the importance of these dual perspectives, both, when comparing SALT with ACID and BASE, and when engineering blockchain-based applications. We expect the next-generation of decentralized transactional applications to leverage combinations of all three transaction models.

AB In the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, users can deterministically derive the private keys used for transmitting money from a password. Such "brain wallets" are appealing because they free users from storing their private keys on untrusted computers. Unfortunately, they also enable attackers to conduct unlimited offline password guessing. In this paper, we report on the first large-scale measurement of the use of brain wallets in Bitcoin. Using a wide range of word lists, we evaluated around 300 billion passwords. Surprisingly, after excluding activities by researchers, we identified just 884 brain wallets worth around $100K in use from September 2011 to August 2015. We find that all but 21 wallets were drained, usually within 24 h but often within minutes. We find that around a dozen "drainers" are competing to liquidate brain wallets as soon as they are funded. We find no evidence that users of brain wallets loaded with more bitcoin select stronger passwords, but we do find that brain wallets with weaker passwords are cracked more quickly.

AB This paper introduces some of the interdependent components within the multifaceted solution our team is developing towards accelerating the functionality, complexity and versatility of blockchain-enabled services. The focus here is particularly on introducing and bringing together selected individual components of the solution to achieve a synergistic effect in expanding the functionality of blockchain-enforced smart contracts. The contributions of this paper include: (i) proposing a method for automated management of contracts with hierarchical conditionality structures through an hierarchy of intelligent agents and the use of hierarchical cryptographic key-pairs; (ii) proposing a method for efficient and secure matching and transfer of smart-contract underlyings (entities) among disparate smart contracts/subcontracts; (iii) proposing a method for producing an hierarchy of common secrets to facilitate hierarchical communication channels of increased security, and applying this method both in the context of method (i) and method (ii); and (iv) proposing the use of distributed hash tables DHT in building secure and optimized repositories in the context of method (i) and in the context method (ii), where the former involves a DHT repository of smart contracts and the latter involves a DHT repository of entities underlying smart contracts that are being exchanged among different smart contracts and subcontracts. The smart-contract focused methods introduced in this paper contribute to the overall goal towards a sustainable adaptive mechanism for processing evolving volumes, versatility, and complexity of blockchain transactions, traffic, and services. Blockchain-enabled services are efficient, secure, automated, and allowing worldwide distribution of resources. They present a more efficient and sustainable alternative to current service infrastructures within a range of domains, particularly the legal and financial domains. They also set a sustainable infrastructure for emerging Internet-of-things services.

AB Origin authentication is one of the most concentrated and advocated BGP security approach against IP prefix hijacking. However, the potential risk of centralized authority abuse and the fragile infrastructure may lead a sluggish deployment of such BGP security approach currently. We propose BGPCoin, a trustworthy blockchain-based Internet resource management solution which provides compliant resource allocations and revocations, and a reliable origin advertisement source. By means of a smart contract to perform and supervise resource assignments on the tamper-resistant Ethereum blockchain, BGPCoin yields significant benefits in the secure origin advertisement and the dependable infrastructure for object repository compared with RPKI. We demonstrate through an Ethereum prototype implementation that the deployment incentives and increased security are technically and economically viable.

AB Transactions may be altered, which leads to low credibility of transactions that restricts the rapid development and popularization of E-commerce. Although blockchain can ensure high stability and credibility of data, existing solutions still have some significant scalability barriers, such as low-throughput and high-latency. To improve credibility, this paper presents an e-commerce blockchain consensus mechanism (EBCM). EBCM does not rely on computing power and token but with the same level of security and credibility as Nakamoto consensus. Meanwhile, EBCM achieves real-time transaction and high-throughput. By introducing validation blockchain, we can ensure transactions cannot be altered. In order to realize high-throughput and real-time transaction, this paper constructs a two-layer blockchain. EBCM has been compared with Bitcoin in performance, and demonstrates better on throughput, latency.

AB Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) interconnects thousands of terminal devices to support the services of Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G area. However, centralized access authentication of each terminal has been performed in mobile core network which causes an extremely high operating and capital expenditure of network. Traditional C-RAN cannot provide an authentic mechanism to guarantee the security of services and creditability of device and resource accessing with low network cost. We first propose a blockchain-based trusted authentication (BTA) architecture for 5G with blockchain-based anonymous access (BAA) scheme in cloud radio over fiber network. The feasibility and efficiency are verified on enhanced SDN testbed to enable blockchain as a service.

AB The security of vehicular networks has been paid increasing attention to with the rapid development of automobile industry and Internet of Things (IoT). However, existing approaches mainly focus on ensuring data authentication and integrity, which are not sufficient to assess the credibility of received messages. Recently, reputation systems are proved to be effective approaches to solve the above problem. This paper proposes a new reputation system for data credibility assessment based on the blockchain techniques. In this system, vehicles rate the received messages based on observations of traffic environments and pack these ratings into a "block". Each block is "chained" to the previous one by storing the hash value of the previous block. Then, a temporary center node is elected from vehicles and it is responsible for broadcasting its rating block to others. Based on ratings stored in the blockchain, vehicles are able to calculate the reputation value of the message sender and then evaluate the credibility of the message. Simulation results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting, validating, and storing reputation information in vehicular networks.

AB Joint cloud computing (JointCloud), as a brand-new paradigm of cloud computing, aims at building a cloud ecosystem, in which end users are agnostic to cloud service vendors as applications and services are built upon virtual clouds. In case of low quality cloud resources provided deliberately and in order to facilitate the persistent and sound development of JointCloud ecosystem, we propose a dynamic and customized reputation system framework (DC-RSF) to evaluate the credibility of cloud service vendors. At the core of DC-RSF is the customized and dynamic credibility model (CDCM), which calculates credit value for each cloud service vendor based on service requirements of end users and credential attributes of cloud service vendors. We further incorporate a Blockchain-based module into DC-RSF to prevent the credit value from being artificially tampered.

TI Authentication With Block-Chain Algorithm and Text Encryption Protocol
   in Calculation of Social Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Community detection is an important aspect of social network analysis, but social factors such as user intimacy, influence, and user interaction behavior are often overlooked as important factors. Most of the existing methods are single classification algorithms; multi-classification algorithms that can discover overlapping communities are still incomplete. In former works, we calculated intimacy based on the relationship between users, and divided them into their social communities based on intimacy. However, a malicious user can obtain the other user relationships, thus to infer other users interests, and even pretend to be the another user to cheat others. Therefore the information users concerned about needs to be transferred in the manner of privacy protection. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy preserving algorithm to preserve the privacy of information in social networks. First, during expansion of communities on the base of mining seed, in order to prevent others from malicious users, we verify their identities after they send a request. We make use of the recognition and nontampering of the block chain to store the user's public key and bind to the block address, which is used for authentication. At the same time, in order to prevent the honest but curious users from illegal access to other users' information, we do not send plaintext directly after the authentication, but hash the attributes by mixed hash encryption to make sure that users can only calculate the matching degree rather than know specific information of other users. Analysis shows that our protocol would serve well against different types of attacks.

AB In Bitcoin network, the distributed storage of multiple copies of the blockchain opens up possibilities for double spending, i. e., a payer issues two separate transactions to two different payees transferring the same coins. To detect the doublespending and penalize the malicious payer, decentralized nonequivocation contracts have been proposed. The basic idea of these contracts is that the payer locks some coins in a deposit when he initiates a transaction with the payee. If the payer double spends, a cryptographic primitive called accountable assertions can be used to reveal his Bitcoin credentials for the deposit. Thus, the malicious payer could be penalized by the loss of deposit coins. However, such decentralized non-equivocation contracts are subjected to collusion attacks where the payer colludes with the beneficiary of the deposit and transfers the Bitcoin deposit back to himself when he double spends, resulting in no penalties. On the other hand, even if the beneficiary behaves honestly, the victim payee cannot get any compensation directly from the deposit in the original design. To prevent such collusion attacks, we design fair deposits for Bitcoin transactions to defend against double-spending. The fair deposits ensure that the payer will be penalized by the loss of his deposit coins if he double spends and the victim payee's loss will be compensated. We start with proposing protocols of making a deposit for Bitcoin transactions. We then analyze the performance of deposits made for Bitcoin transactions and show how the fair deposits work efficiently in Bitcoin.

AB As a recently proposed public key primitive, attribute-base encryption(ABE) divided into Ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) and Key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) is a highly promising tool for the management and protection of data. And Blockchain, as one of the core technologies of Bitcoin that is the most representative cryptocurrency, has received extensive attentions recently. Supervision and privacy protection are two difficulties in blockchain. In this paper, a new scheme combining blockchain and accountable CP-ABE is proposed. In this scheme, each change of the data is recorded on the blockchain. And the different permissions of access are realized through ABE. If a malicious user shares a decryption key illegally, it will be considered illegal. Similarly, if the authority generates a decryption key for any unauthorized user, it also will be considered illegal. This scheme allows any third party to publicly verify the identity of a decryption key. And it is achievable for an auditor to publicly audit whether a malicious user or the authority should be responsible for an exposed decryption key, and the key abuser cannot deny it. At last this scheme is applied to the management of electronic documents.

AB Cryptocurrency mining can be said to be the modern alchemy, involving as it does the transmutation of electricity into digital gold. The goal of mining is to guess the solution to a cryptographic puzzle, the difficulty of which is determined by the network, and thence to win the block reward and transaction fees. Because the return on solo mining has a very high variance, miners band together to create so-called mining pools. These aggregate the power of several individual miners, and, by distributing the accumulated rewards according to some scheme, ensure a more predictable return for participants.
   In this paper we formulate a model of the dynamics of a queue-based reward distribution scheme in a popular Ethereum mining pool and develop a corresponding simulation. We show that the underlying mechanism disadvantages miners with above-average hash rates. We then consider two-miner scenarios and show how large miners may perform attacks to increase their profits at the expense of other participants of the mining pool. The outcomes of our analysis show the queue-based reward scheme is vulnerable to manipulation in its current implementation.

Conventional manufacturing modes are undergoing profound reforms in the Internet and Big Data era, and operations management of such factories should lay more emphasis on service values. To this end, the current manufacturing modes and operations management strategies are fully investigated in this paper. A CPSS (cyber-physical-social system)-based manufacturing mode of smart factories for high-end equipment manufacturing is put forward. The connotation of operations management of smart factory is extended based on the introduction of service value and value chain, thus contributing to a win-win situation of an enterprise and its customers. Furthermore, a multi-participation Blockchain-based collaborative manufacturing model for smart factories is presented.

TI A "Social Bitcoin" could sustain a democratic digital world
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS
AB A multidimensional financial system could provide benefits for individuals, companies, and states. Instead of top-down control, which is destined to eventually fail in a hyperconnected world, a bottom-up creation of value can unleash creative potential and drive innovations. Multiple currency dimensions can represent different externalities and thus enable the design of incentives and feedback mechanisms that foster the ability of complex dynamical systems to self-organize and lead to a more resilient society and sustainable economy. Modern information and communication technologies play a crucial role in this process, as Web 2.0 and online social networks promote cooperation and collaboration on unprecedented scales. Within this contribution, we discuss how one dimension of a multidimensional currency system could represent socio-digital capital (Social Bitcoins) that can be generated in a bottom-up way by individuals who perform search and navigation tasks in a future version of the digital world. The incentive to mine Social Bitcoins could sustain digital diversity, which mitigates the risk of totalitarian control by powerful monopolies of information and can create new business opportunities needed in times where a large fraction of current jobs is estimated to disappear due to computerisation.

TI Tetrapeptide Endomorphin Analogs Require Both Full Length and Truncated
   Splice Variants of the Mu Opioid Receptor Gene Oprm1 for Analgesia
SO ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE
AB The mu opioid receptor gene undergoes extensive alternative splicing. Mu opioids can be divided into three classes based on the role of different groups of splice variants. Morphine and methadone require only full length seven transmembrane (7TM) variants for analgesia, whereas IBNtxA (3'-iodobenzyol-6 beta-naltrexamide) needs only truncated 6TM variants. A set of endomorphin analogs fall into a third group that requires both 6TM and 7TM splice variants. Unlike morphine, endomorphin 1 and 2, DAPP (Dmt,D-Ala-Phe-Phe-NH2), and IDAPP (3'-iodo-Dmt-D-Ala-Phe-Phe-NH2) analgesia was lost in an exon 11 knockout mouse lacking 6TM variants. Restoring 6TM variant expression in a knockout mouse lacking both 6TM and 7TM variants failed to rescue DAPP or IDAPP analgesia. However, reestablishing 6TM expression in an exon 11 knockout mouse that still expressed 7TM variants did rescue the response, consistent with the need for both 6TM and 7TM variants. In receptor binding assays, I-1251-IDAPP labeled more sites (B-max) than H-3-DAMGO Go-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly(ol)(5)]-enkephalin) in wild-type mice. In exon 11 knockout mice, I-125-IDAPP binding was lowered to levels similar to 3H-DAMGO, which remained relatively unchanged compared to wild-type mice. I-125-IDAPP binding was totally lost in an exon 1/exon 11 knockout model lacking all Oprm1 variant expression, confirming that the drug was not cross labeling non-mu opioid receptors. These findings suggested that I-125-IDAPP labeled two populations of mu binding sites in wild-type mice, one corresponding to 7TM variants and the second dependent upon 6TM variants. Together, these data indicate that endomorphin analogs represent a unique, genetically defined, and distinct class of mu opioid analgesic.

TI Securities, intermediation and the blockchain: an inevitable choice
   between liquidity and legal certainty?
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
AB The practice of securities holding, transfer, and collateral has changed significantly over the past 200 years-moving from paper certificates and issuer registers, to an intermediated environment, and from there to computerization and globalization. These changes have made transacting more efficient and thus rendered markets more liquid. However, the law has lagged behind and is now itself an obstacle to efficiency because international securities transactions are subject to considerable legal uncertainty. The latest global market development, a cryptographic transfer process commonly called the blockchain, is the most recent efficiency-enhancing change. It offers a unique possibility to create a consistent legal framework for securities from scratch, on the basis of a legal concept that, to some extent, resembles bearer securities. This article shows what the new international legal framework could look like in the light of experience gained from earlier developments.

TI The Three Challenges of Stateless Justice
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL DISPUTE SETTLEMENT
AB The article explores the phenomenon of stateless justice. It proceeds as follows. After an introduction, Section 2 clarifies the relevant meaning of the word 'justice'. Section 3 describes the emergence of stateless justice, using Bitcoin as a case study. Section 4 clarifies that the notion of stateless justice does not encompass international arbitration. Sections 5, 6 and 7 address the three challenges posed by stateless justice. Finally, Section 8 of the article proposes a new interpretative model for a better understanding of justice, beyond the theoretical framework of state-centrism.

TI Opening discussion on banking sector risk exposures and vulnerabilities
   from Virtual currencies: An Operational Risk perspective
SO JOURNAL OF BANKING REGULATION
AB We develop the first basic Operational Risk perspective on key risk management issues associated with the development of new forms of electronic currency in the real economy. In particular, we focus on understanding the development of new risk types and the evolution of current risk types, as new components of financial institutions arise to cater for an increasing demand for electronic money, micro-payment systems, Virtual money and cryptographic (Crypto) currencies. The article proposes a framework of risk identification and assessment applied to Virtual and Crypto currencies from a banking regulation perspective. In doing so, it addresses the topical issues of understanding important key Operational Risk vulnerabilities and exposure risk drivers under the framework of the Basel II/III banking regulation, specifically associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies. This is critical to consider, should such alternative currencies continue to grow in utilisation to the point that they enter into the banking sector, through commercial banks and financial institutions which are beginning to contemplate their recognition in terms of deposits, transactions and exchangeability for fiat currencies. We highlight how some of the features of Virtual and Crypto currencies are important drivers of Operational Risk, posing both management and regulatory challenges that must start to be considered and addressed both by regulators, central banks and security exchanges. In this article, we focus purely on the Operational Risk perspective of banks operating in an environment where such 'electronic' Virtual currencies are available. Some aspects of this discussion are directly relevant now, while others can be understood as discussions to raise awareness of issues in Operational Risk that will arise as Virtual currency starts to interact more widely in the real economy. We propose a structure of risk analysis starting with the exposures and vulnerabilities of Virtual and Crypto currencies as the drivers of Operational Risk for these new means of exchange. Then, by using risk drivers, our approach allows us to highlight the sources of possible adverse consequences, when using or generating Virtual and Crypto currencies. These are then mapped into the risks associated to the Basel categories, providing an easier view of regulatory response, and better mitigation techniques. In addition, this will help identify and address the root causes of the Operational Risks associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies, rather than just presenting their symptoms.

TI Exploring Phase Progression Throughout the Therapeutic Process: The Case
   of Eva
SO CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY & PSYCHOTHERAPY
AB This study intends to clarify how Eva [a good-outcome case] developed a more differentiated and integrated sense of herself and her experience, and how the therapist facilitated this developmental process. It aims to deepen our understanding of the processes of change throughout the therapeutic process by analysing a longitudinal case study integrating a phase-by-phase map-the sequential phases of the Paradigmatic Complementarity Metamodel [PCM]-with a moment-by-moment tracking method-the Developmental Analysis of Psychotherapy Process [DAPP] Method.
   A team of three researchers analysed the sessions from the first year of therapy, identified phase transitions and consolidations, and discussed what in the process appears to have fostered them. The results suggest that Eva evolved in accordance with the sequence of phases proposed by the PCM, which we illustrate and explain with therapeutic interactions representative of Eva's development within the evolving therapeutic process.
   This case study is one of a series intended to contribute to the optimization of clinical decision making by identifying markers of phase progression and assessing the usefulness of the therapeutic interventions offered. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Capital Flight and Bitcoin Regulation
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCE
AB This paper studies the risk of Bitcoin being used for the purpose of capital flight. We propose a new indicator, the bitcoin-implied exchange rate discount, to identify empirically capital flight via Bitcoin. Using data from the two largest bitcoin exchanges in the world during our sample period, BTC China and Bitstamp, we find strong evidence of capital flight from the Chinese Renminbi to the US Dollar via Bitcoin before the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, announced its regulatory policy on December 5, 2013, while the evidence displays no trace of capital flight after the announcement. The People's Bank of China's Bitcoin restriction policy successfully halts the illicit capital outflow via Bitcoin, thereby providing valuable policy implications for government regulation on Bitcoin, as well as on other virtual currencies.

TI Blockchain for Land Administration
SO GIM INTERNATIONAL-THE WORLDWIDE MAGAZINE FOR GEOMATICS
AB Over the past year, the international property rights sector has been abuzz with the potential for blockchain technology to fundamentally transform the approach to land administration. Even Peruvian economist and expert on property rights Hernando de Soto himself became part of this discussion in June 2015 while on Richard Branson's private island, brainstorming as to how blockchain might be applicable to the land sector. However, the initial frenzy has waned as the implementation of blockchain has demonstrated that the technology is not simply a wholesale 'fix' of the land sector, but rather should be applied realistically and piloted at a reasonable scale.

TI Apple Pay, Bitcoin, and Consumers: The ABCs of Future Public Payments
   Law
SO HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
AB As technology rolls out ongoing and competing streams of payments innovation, exemplified by Apple Pay (mobile payments) and Bitcoin (cryptocurrency), the law governing these payments appears hopelessly behind the curve. The patchwork of state, federal, and private legal rules seems more worthy of condemnation than emulation. This Article argues, however, that the legal and market developments of the last several decades in payment systems provide compelling evidence of the most realistic and socially beneficial future for payments law. The paradigm of a comprehensive public law regulatory scheme for payment systems. exemplified by Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code. has faded in relevance, while federal law has grown in a specialized consumer protection role. Meanwhile, private contract law has expanded to fill gaps where payment technology has exceeded the scope of public law.
   The evidence of the successes and failures of payments law in the face of rapid technological development shows that the field is not best governed by comprehensive public regulation on the Uniform Commercial Code model, but that public law still has an important. albeit narrower. role for the future. The most beneficial paradigm for governance of payment systems is a division between (1) private law handling systemic matters of operation, and (2) public law focused on protecting payment system end-users from oppression, fraud, and mistake. This demarcation of lawmaking responsibilities has the greatest track record of success and is the most capable of dealing with a foreseeable future of unforeseeable innovations.

TI The Digital Currency Challenge for the Regulatory Regime
SO REVISTA CHILENA DE DERECHO Y TECNOLOGIA
AB Digital currencies pose several questions. First, finding the best definition. Digital currencies have specific features that make necessary to mention in its definition. The second puzzle that they present is the function of Internet. It is important because Internet is the vehicle for the good functioning of digital currency schemes. The network provides all the facilities to digital currency, but it also may be a place for criminal activity. The third question is the relation of digital currencies and the e-commerce. The electronic commerce is an antecedent of virtual currencies. The necessity to make the payment quicker and easier makes possible the growth of virtual currencies. Finally, there is the puzzle of the regulation. A complete regulation does not exist in the digital area. It is the nature of the Internet. It is a place where there are no financial rules. Criminal activity and improper use of Internet will increase over time.

AB Bitcoin, a virtual currency that employs a novel technology that engenders trust and value in a decentralized peer-to-peer network, has exploded in use since it was first introduced in 2009. Yet, despite this explosive growth, researchers have barely started to investigate who uses Bitcoin, how and why they are used, and what the growth of virtual currency means for society. This paper examines Bitcoin as a currency, software platform, and community. It discusses the background of the virtual currency and presents the results of one of the first exploratory surveys to ask Bitcoin users and nonusers alike their opinions about Bitcoin and how these opinions relate to personal and cultural values. We examine how these views about Bitcoin are informed by attitudes towards money, technology, government, and social structure.

AB Financial transaction networks are some of the largest networks in existence. A relatively new type of financial networks is the digital (crypto) currency network, e.g., Bitcoin. Namecoin is an alternative crypto currency, based on Bitcoin, with additional features such as DNS. Namecoin network has more than 2 million nodes and almost 17 million edges. The analysis of such a crypto currency network can help us model or predict the future growth of the transaction networks. In order to analyze the transaction network graph over time, we analyzed the Namecoin blockchain data in 7 six months intervals. Our findings suggest different user behavior and developing pattern compared to Bitcoin.

AB To accommodate the trend toward mass customization launched by intelligent manufacturing, the paper proposes the adoption of model-integrated computing (MIC) paradigm in the motion control system development process for enhancing flexibility and robustness. Hierarchical structural and behavioral diversities in motion control system are considered during the implementation of MIC paradigm. For design-phase implementation, a motion-control-domain-specific modeling language is developed, and formal semantics are integrated. With regard to execution-phase implementation, a real-time runtime framework compliant with the IEC 61499 standard is proposed. Extensions of function block chain and priority-based event propagation are proposed. Dynamically extendable FB types library for motion control domain is constructed. A prototype three-axis motion control system is modeled using the proposed modelling language and is then deployed to the implemented framework to prove the feasibility of the adoption of the MIC paradigm in motion control domain.

AB To preserve the Bitcoin ledger's integrity, a node that joins the system must download a full copy of the entire Bitcoin blockchain if it wants to verify newly created blocks.
   At the time of writing, the blockchain weights 79 GiB and takes hours of processing on high-end machines. Owners of low-resource devices (known as thin nodes), such as smartphones, avoid that cost by either opting for minimum verification or by depending on full nodes, which weakens their security model.
   In this work, we propose to harden the security model of thin nodes by enabling them to verify blocks in an adaptive manner, with regards to the level of targeted confidence, with low storage requirements and a short bootstrap time. Our approach exploits sharding within adistributed hash table (DHT) to distribute the storage load, and a few additional hashes to prevent attacks on this new system.

TI Are Transaction Costs Drivers of Financial Institutions? Contracts Made

SO BANKING BEYOND BANKS AND MONEY: A GUIDE TO BANKING SERVICES IN THE
   TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY
SE New Economic Windows
AB In 16th century Europe, the revolution in printing technology and increasing literacy in European cities created a positive shock to capital productivity. At the same time, the spread of Protestantism in Northern Europe induced individuals to honour contracts or risk exclusion from the Kingdom of God. Max Weber would argue that the religious institution of Protestantism, by dissuading defection from agreements, had allowed a new form of almost trustless exchange with strangers. Strict self-enforcing religious rules restrained individuals from opportunistic behaviour thus lowering the cost of monitoring and enforcing contracts. This led to increasing commerce and economic growth. A better capitalized, but less strict Catholic Southern Europe was unable to exert control and reduce contracting costs in the same way leading to less exchange. We argue that peer to peer technologies, such as Bitcoin, Blockchains, smart contracts, and peer-to-peer (P2P) legal platforms recall these historical evolutions. We anticipate that these technologies will reduce the cost of contracting, specifically with regards to contract monitoring and enforcement. Trustless exchange without some of the current intermediaries specializing inmonitoring and enforcement technologies will have a significant impact on the financial systemand its institutional structure. Moving beyond theory, this chapter discusses some of the major manifestations of technologies capable to strongly decrease the cost of contracting, and it proposes a certain class of models to explore how P2P technologies, and the concomitant reduction in transaction costs they will cause, can be expected to affect financial exchange.

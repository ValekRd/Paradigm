AB Over the past 15 years the topic of information security economics has grown to become a large and diverse field, influencing security thinking on issues as diverse as bitcoin markets and cybersecurity insurance. An aspect yet to receive much attention in this respect is that of secure software development, or 'SWSec' - another area that has seen a surge of research since 2000. SWSec provides paradigms, practices and procedures that offer some promise to address current security problems, yet those solutions face financial and technical barriers that necessitate a more thorough approach to planning and execution. Meanwhile, information security economics has developed theory and practice to support a particular world-view; however, it has yet to account for the investments, constructs and benefits of SWSec. As the frequency and severity of computer misuse has increased, both areas have struggled to impart a new mindset for addressing the inherent issues that arise in a diverse, connected and functionality-driven landscape.
   This paper presents a call for the establishment of an economics of secure software development. We present the primary challenges facing practice, citing relevant literature from both communities to illustrate where commonalities lie - and where further work is needed. Those challenges are decomposed into a research agenda, deriving from the application of principles in both themes a lack of models, representation and analysis in practice. A framework emerges that facilitates discussions of security theory and practice.

AB To manage the smart electric grid of the future, fundamental changes are required in the system operational paradigm. Availability of high-resolution data at faster speed and advanced computational advancements provide opportunities to bring this fundamental change. Monitoring and control algorithms need to be evolved to match the transition of centralized generation to distributed generation. Intermittency of renewable generation and push towards real time control requires faster control actions, which is possible with decentralized power grid applications. With integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), the stability assessment application need to handle a large number of data points in real time. This requires massive computing resources, and requirements will increase for possible real time control action. Decentralized applications need to be coordinated and manged with existing centralized applications. This paper addresses the development of a fault-tolerant distributed computing architecture (DCBlocks) for implementing a decentralized voltage stability monitoring and control application. Results for IEEE 30 bus system have been provided to validate the developed architecture. Distributed computing algorithms are implemented using open source platform Akka Java and DeterLab test bed.

Attackers can target SDN controllers with simple attacks to cause denial of service. We proposed a defense mechanism based on a proof-of-work protocol. The key characteristics of this protocol, namely its one-way operation, its requirement for freshness in proofs of work, its adjustable difficulty, its ability to work with multiple network providers, and its use of existing TCP/IP header fields, ensure that this approach can be used in practice.

AB Recent work introduced the concept of NRGcoin [1] - a decentralized digital currency for renewable energy, based on Blockchain technology. In this abstract we summarize the concept and outline how this currency benefits each stakeholder in the smart grid and the renewable energy economy as a whole.
   The NRGcoin concept is visualized in Figure 1. When a prosumer generates energy and injects it in the grid (1), she receives information from the grid operator (2) on the balance of supply and demand in the micro-grid (or district). This information is then used by the smart meter at that agent's home to securely create (3) (also issue, or " mint"), new digital units (or NRGcoins) for that prosumer. For every 1kWh of renewable energy that the prosumer injects in the grid, her smart meter creates 1 NRGcoin. At any time, the prosumer can offer to sell her coins (4) on the NRGcoin currency market -a FOREXtype currency exchange. Consumers join the NRGcoin market and buy NRGcoins (5) using fiat currency, e.g. Euro, Dollar, Pound, etc. When consumers use green energy from the grid (6), their smart meter automatically pays for that consumption using NRGcoins (7), instead of traditional currency. 1 kWh green energy consumption from the grid costs 1 NRGcoin, regardless of the current retail cost of energy. Nevertheless, since NRGcoin is linked to energy, which in turn is linked to money, NRGcoin is indirectly linked to the monetary value of energy, unlike other digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, which are not linked to any particular value. Thus it is expected that NRGcoin will always fluctuate closely around the retail value of electricity. All digital transactions of NRGcoins, including their creation, are governed by the decentralized NRGcoin protocol -a piece of software running on the peer-to-peer network of smart meters. This protocol is based on the Blockchain technology [2].
   Thus the NRGcoin concept offers a number of benefits to each stakeholder in the smart grid. It serves as:
   a subsidy scheme for renewable installations with lower risk against policy change for prosumers. The issuance of the currency is governed by a decentralized protocol that can only be changed by a majority vote and thus not by individual market actors.
   a currency that offers consumers an alternative payment choice and cheaper green energy. High NRGcoin supply on the currency exchange market will drive NRGcoin price down, resulting in lower cost of green energy.
   a financial tool offering faster cash flow and profit to retailers and grid operators. As a peer-to-peer currency, NRGcoin can process micro- payments, e. g. payments for energy every 15 minutes, at virtually zero overhead costs.
   a mechanism that reduces the need for government support schemes, since prosumers are generating their own money, thus saving on budget.
   an asset from which investors profit when electricity prices increase. Buying the currency at the current retail price of energy and selling at a later point will generate profits, asit has been estimated that electricity prices tend to increase, rather than decrease [4].

AB In the Bitcoin network, lack of class labels tend to cause obscurities in anomalous financial behaviour interpretation. To understand fraud in the latest development of the financial sector, a multifaceted approach is proposed. In this paper, Bitcoin fraud is described from both global and local perspectives using trimmed k-means and kd-trees. The two spheres are investigated further through random forests, maximum likelihood-based and boosted binary regression models. Although both angles show good performance, global outlier perspective outperforms the local viewpoint with exception of random forest that exhibits nearby perfect results from both dimensions. This signifies that features extracted for this study describe the network fairly.

AB This study aims to assess the potential of the Dethridge wheel for developing power from very low head sites in open channel flow. The Dethridge wheel has been in use since early 20(th) century for measuring flow in irrigation canals. Being robust and simple in design, this technology served as a reliable flow metering solution for more than a century. Working in a similar principle to the conventional waterwheel, this wheel could be a viable option of power generation for decentralized application in remote areas. Two different methods, experimental and numerical, are used for investigating the potential of the wheel. An experimental approach in which a physical model of the Dethridge wheel is built and tested at the hydraulics laboratory of Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences. Whereas a three dimensional numerical model of the Dethridge wheel is simulated using a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code Flow-3D. Efficiency of around 60% is achieved in the model tests. Computed results are also in good agreement with the physical model results. The results from the physical and the numerical model are presented in this paper.

AB In traditional product companies, creating value meant identifying enduring customer needs and manufacturing well-engineered solutions. Two hundred and fifty years after the start of the Industrial Revolution, this pattern of activity plays out every day in a connected world where products are no longer one-and-done. Making money is not anymore limited to physical product sales; other downstream revenue streams become possible (e.g., service-based information, Apps). Nonetheless, it is still challenging to stimulate the IoT market by enabling IoT stakeholders (from organizations to an individual persons) to make money out of the information that surrounds them. Generally speaking, there is a lack of micro billing frameworks and platforms that enable IoT stakeholders to publish/discover, and potentially sell/buy relevant and useful IoT information items. This paper discusses important aspects that need to be considered when investigating and developing such a framework/platform. A high-level requirement analysis is then carried out to identify key technological and scientific building blocks for laying the foundation of an innovative micro billing framework named IoTBnB (IoT puBlication aNd Billing).

AB Bitcoin is a digital payment system empowered by a distributed database called blockchain. The blockchain is an open ledger containing records of every transaction within Bitcoin system maintained by Bitcoin nodes all over the world. Because of its availability and robustness, the blockchain could be utilized as a record-keeping tool for information not related to any Bitcoin transactions. We propose a method of utilizing the blockchain of Bitcoin system to publish information by embedding an arbitrary size of data into Bitcoin transactions. By publishing information using the blockchain, the information also carries the characteristics of Bitcoin transaction: anonymous, decentralized, and permanent. The proposed protocol could be used to extend the functionality of asset management systems which are limited to a maximum of 80 bytes data. The proposed method also offers an efficiency of the transaction fee by 18 percent compared to Bitcoin Messaging protocol.

AB Bitcoin is a new online decentralised payment system equipped by a cryptographic system which runs in a peer-to-peer network. While it denies any central authority, it can still verify and validate the transactions by its protocol. To make the transactions accountable, Bitcoin uses an open database which can be seen and checked by anyone. Despite no direct relationship between the Bitcoin transactions and the identity of the users, the information about the users can still be gathered by analysing the information contained in the transactions. We propose a protocol which minimises the relationship between the transactions to protect the information of the payer from the curious payee.

AB The morphological changes in giant spherical vesicles comprised of amphilhilic poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid), PMAA-b-P(MMA-r-MAA), by incorporation of the 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SpMA) into the hydrophilic PMAA block chains were investigated. The vesicles were reduced in size as the SpMA ratio increased due to the variation in the critical packing shape by the expansion of the hydrophilic surface area by the incorporation of the more hydrophilic ionic segments. The increase in the SpMA ratio also delayed the transition from the spherical vesicles to a film-like bilayer. The giant vesicles containing the SpMA segments were disrupted into a nonspecific form by the electrostatic interaction with poly(allylamine hydrochloride) at a 2.5 M ratio of the unit for the allylamine hydrochloride (AH) to the SpMA. A large excess of the AH/SpMA above 5.0 caused no disruption, but partial fusion of the vesicles accompanied by a decrease in size.

AB Bitcoin is a kind of novel distributed electronic cash free of any governmental influence and supervision. Its irreversibility, pseudonymity and unforgeability have made great developmental leaps in means of payment and investment management. However, when the application of the means of payment is applied in small and medium-sized enterprises or companies, bitcoin lacks the mechanism to be jointly managed. We propose a Distributed Bitcoin Account Management (DBAM) framework that realizes joint management of bitcoin accounts applied especially to enterprises and companies. The framework incorporates secret sharing and attribute based encryption schemes compatible with the existing bitcoin protocols. Each bitcoin account achieves fine-grained management of participants and prevents the private key from being unexpectedly recovered. Thorough analyses show that our framework is secure, practical and effective.

AB Novel pyridine-containing linear and branched polyimides (Li-Pls and Br-Pls) were prepared by aromatic diamine and triamine monomers. The fluorinated, non-fluorinated and trifunctional pyridine-based monomers, 4-(4-(trifluoromethylphenyl))-2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyridine (FDAPP), 4-phenyl-2,6-bis(4-aminophenyl)pyridine (DAPP) and 4,4',4 ''-(pyridine-2,4,6-triyptribenzenamine (TAPP) amino compounds were synthesized by a modified Chichibabin reaction of different benzaldehydes and p-nitroacetophenone, followed by a reduction of the resulting nitro compounds with hydrazine monohydrate. Functional amine monomers were used to synthesize a series of pyridine-containing linear and branched polyimides, by polycondensation with aromatic dianhydride in N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) via the conventional two-step method. The obtained novel polyimides (Pls) exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as m-Cresol, NMP, DMF, DMSO and DMAc. Moreover, obtained PI films were flexible and showed excellent thermal stability, with the glass transition temperature (T-g) of 264-331 degrees C and the temperature at 10% weight loss of 580-620 degrees C in a nitrogen atmosphere. The protonated polymer showed UV-vis absorption in the region of 200-400 nm, good optical transparency with the cut-off wave lengths of 372-392 nm, as well as a low dielectric constant (epsilon) in the range of 3.897-4.276 at 1 MHz. Moreover, the resulted Pls derived from DAPP, FDAPP and TAPP were compared on the basis of fluorine functionality with non-fluorinated parallels, and the effect of branching units was compared with linear polymers.

TI Analyzing the special PFG signal attenuation behavior of intermolecular
   MQC via the effective phase shift diffusion equation method
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB Inter-molecular multiple quantum coherence (iMQC) has important applications in NMR and MRI. However, the current theoretical methods still have some difficulties in analyzing the behavior of iMQC signal attenuation of pulsed field gradient diffusion experiments. In this paper, the iMQC diffusion experiments were analyzed by an effective phase shift diffusion equation (EPSDE) method, which is based on the idea that the accumulating phase shift (APS) can be viewed as the result of a diffusion process in virtual phase space (VPS) with effective diffusion coefficient K-2(t)D (rad(2)/s) where K(t) = integral(t)(0) gamma g(t') dt' is a wavenumber and D is the physical diffusion coefficient of the spin carrier in the real space. The term K(t(tot))z(1) needs to be added to the APS when K(t(tot)) is not zero. Most of the time, K(t(tot)) equals zero. However, in iMQC experiments, the condition K(t(tot)) equaling zero or being non-zero for each spin depends on the gradient pulse setting. The signal attenuations of these two types of iMQC, zero or non-zero K(t(tot)), were analyzed in detail for free and restricted diffusions, which shows that there are significant differences between these two types of iMQC. Particularly, if an apparent diffusion coefficient D-app is used to analyze the signal attenuation, it equals nD for zero K(t(tot)) which agrees with current theoretical and experimental reports, while for non-zero K(t(tot)), it equals (2n - 1) D which agrees with experimental results from the literature; there are no similar theoretical results reported for comparison. The result that D-app equals (2n -1) D is important because the higher value of Dapp means that non-zero K(t(tot)) iMQC can potentially provide more contrast and measure slower diffusion rates than zero K(t(tot)) iMQC. The EPSDE method provides a new way to analyze iMQC diffusion experiments. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Bitcoin is the first technology for the final transfer of digital goods online, facilitating instant global payments without intermediation. Bitcoin's operation is based on a distributed, decentralized, and transparent asset ledger that acts as an ongoing chain record of all transactions. The system issues coins to reward those who contribute processing power to the network's operation. The possibilities created by this innovation are significant for the world's poor, who could skip traditional political and financial institutions and move to digital currencies in the same way they have gone straight to using mobile phones and skipped landline telephones.

TI Taxing Bitcoin Transactions Under Polish Tax Law
SO COMPARATIVE ECONOMIC RESEARCH-CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPE
AB Recent years have witnessed the emergence of digital currencies - digital representations of value which are transferred using IT technologies and used as a medium of exchange but are not recognised as official means of payment. Bitcoins are one of such currencies and their popularity in Europe and in Poland has been growing. Hence it is a good time to consider to what extent Polish law is prepared to face the phenomenon and what potential problems may arise from it for the judicial system. The main objective of the paper is to analyse Polish tax regulations in the context of bitcoin transactions, as broadly understood.

TI BRB: BetteR Batch Scheduling to Reduce Tail Latencies in Cloud Data
   Stores
SO ACM SIGCOMM COMPUTER COMMUNICATION REVIEW
AB A common pattern in the architectures of modern interactive web-services is that of large request fan-outs, where even a single end-user request (task) arriving at an application server triggers tens to thousands of data accesses (sub-tasks) to different stateful backend servers. The overall response time of each task is bottlenecked by the completion time of the slowest sub-task, making such workloads highly sensitive to the tail of latency distribution of the backend tier. The large number of decentralized application servers and skewed workload patterns exacerbate the challenge in addressing this problem.
   We address these challenges through BetteR Batch (BRB). By carefully scheduling requests in a decentralized and task aware manner, BRB enables low-latency distributed storage systems to deliver predictable performance in the presence of large request fan-outs. Our preliminary simulation results based on production workloads show that our proposed design is at the 99th percentile latency within 38% of an ideal system model while offering latency improvements over the state-of-the-art by a factor of 2.

TI The DAPP-SF as a Screener for Personality Disorder in a Forensic Setting
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT
AB Studies on the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Short Form (DAPP-SF) have shown its ability to identify treatment-seeking patients with personality disorders. This study focuses on its screening potential for personality disorder in 89 criminal suspects (77 men, 12 women; M age = 37.0years) undergoing residential pretrial psychological assessments in a high-security setting. It was expected that Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV) criteria met for personality disorder(s) would be associated with higher DAPP-SF scores. A floor effect was found in DAPP-SF scores: The forensic population reported less personality pathology than the general population. Only moderate associations between DAPP-SF and SIDP-IV outcome were found. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that some DAPP-SF subscales did not exceed chance level in their ability to screen for personality disorders. It is concluded that the DAPP-SF has limited usefulness as a screener for personality disorders in a forensic pretrial setting. Alternative forensic screening instruments are presented.

AB In this paper, we present Productive Puzzles, a novel puzzle mechanism for defending against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Productive puzzles aim to use tasks from real applications and servicesas opposed to repetitive cryptographic computations that only serve the security purpose-as the work to be completed by the client, therefore making meaningful use of the client resources that would be wasted otherwise. We prove that tight bounds on the probability of successful cheating can be achieved by using only a small number of tasks in a productive puzzle. Hardness of productive puzzles is dynamically adjusted based on the server load and the cost of processing the client's request, consequently making it harder for adversaries to leverage expensive requests in their attacks. Furthermore, a novel cache algorithm is introduced to prevent the puzzle solution replay attack that is a common threat to all puzzle based DDoS defense mechanisms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the productive puzzle scheme in a realistic experimental environment, and show that it provides nearly optimal puzzle based defense against DDoS attacks.

TI Modeling and Verification of the Bitcoin Protocol
SO ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Bitcoin is a popular digital currency for online payments, realized as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Bitcoin keeps a ledger of all transactions; the majority of the participants decides on the correct ledger. Since there is no trusted third party to guard against double spending, and inspired by its popularity, we would like to investigate the correctness of the Bitcoin protocol. Double spending is an important threat to electronic payment systems. Double spending would happen if one user could force a majority to believe that a ledger without his previous payment is the correct one. We are interested in the probability of success of such a double spending attack, which is linked to the computational power of the attacker. This paper examines the Bitcoin protocol and provides its formalization as an UPPAAL model. The model will be used to show how double spending can be done if the parties in the Bitcoin protocol behave maliciously, and with what probability double spending occurs.

AB Bitcoin is designed to protect user anonymity (or pseudonymity) in a financial transaction, and has been increasingly adopted by major e-commerce websites such as Dell, PayPal and Expedia. While the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions has been extensively studied, little attention has been paid to the security of post-transaction correspondence. In a commercial application, the merchant and the user often need to engage in follow-up correspondence after a Bitcoin transaction is completed, e.g., to acknowledge the receipt of payment, to confirm the billing address, to arrange the product delivery, to discuss refund and so on. Currently, such follow-up correspondence is typically done in plaintext via email with no guarantee on confidentiality. Obviously, leakage of sensitive data from the correspondence (e.g., billing address) can trivially compromise the anonymity of Bitcoin users. In this paper, we initiate the first study on how to realise end-to-end secure communication between Bitcoin users in a post-transaction scenario without requiring any trusted third party or additional authentication credentials. This is an important new area that has not been covered by any IEEE or ISO/IEC security standard, as none of the existing PKI-based or password-based AKE schemes are suitable for the purpose. Instead, our idea is to leverage the Bitcoin's append-only ledger as an additional layer of authentication between previously confirmed transactions. This naturally leads to a new category of AKE protocols that bootstrap trust entirely from the block chain. We call this new category "Bitcoin-based AKE" and present two concrete protocols: one is non-interactive with no forward secrecy, while the other is interactive with additional guarantee of forward secrecy. Finally, we present proof-of-concept prototypes for both protocols with experimental results to demonstrate their practical feasibility.

TI Stability of Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Tracking Categorical and
   Dimensional Rating Systems Over a Two-Year Period
SO PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Personality disorders are characterized as temporally stable patterns of symptoms (APA, 2000). However, evidence on the stability of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is generally lacking. This study tracked the prevalence and remission rates of individual criteria for NPD over the course of 2 years. In addition, the stability of dimensional personality pathology in patients with NPD (assessed with the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology, DAPP-BQ) was assessed over time. A sample of 96 patients with a diagnosis of NPD was recruited at baseline. Forty patients participated in the follow-up assessment 2 years later. Our results indicate a moderate remission rate (53%) for NPD as a categorical diagnosis. However, single NPD criteria differed in their prevalence and temporal stability, similar to findings for other personality disorders. Moreover, scores on dimensional subscales of the DAPP-BQ remained stable over time. Theoretical implications are discussed.

AB Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin, an open source, peer to peer, digital crypto currency has been growing in popularity and wide spread use. Growing attention, recognition by major financial institutions and high valued currency units (BTC) ascertains Bitcoin to a sturdy and ever increasing choice of currency. A public transaction log called the "Blockchain" keeps records of all committed transactions and Bitcoin ownership details, that is, addresses derived by cryptographic keys. Bitcoin mining, a process which results in the generation of new Bitcoins, is performed by miner operators for reception of incentives in the form of Bitcoins. This mining process is essentially operations of SHA-256 hashing of values in search of a hash digest smaller than a specific value. Once this winning hash has been discovered, a new block to Blockchain is added and BTC incentives are furnished by the Bitcoin network to the miner. This paper discusses methods of performing Bitcoin mining on non-custom hardware which results in contextually faster mining by combined usage of computing elements within machines in mining networks, both illegal and legal.

AB Most current digital currency schemes and associated ledgers are either centralized or completely distributed similar to the design adopted by Bitcoin. Centralized schemes enable accountability, but leave the privacy of users' identities and transactions in the hands of one organization. Distributed schemes can ensure better privacy but provide little accountability. In this paper we design a privacy-preserving proactively-secure distributed ledger and associated transaction protocols that can be used to implement an accountable digital currency that inherits the ledger's privacy and security features. One of the main technical challenges that we address is dealing with the increase in ledger size over time, an unavoidable aspect as the currency spreads and the ledger is required to be maintained for a long time in the future. We accomplish this by reducing the distributed (secret-shared) storage footprint and the required bandwidth and computation for proactively refreshing the ledger to ensure long-term confidentiality and security.

AB Smart contracts (SC) are one of the most appealing features of blockchain technologies facilitating, executing, and enforcing predefined terms of coded contracts without intermediaries. The steady adoption of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain has led to tens of thousands of contracts holding millions of dollars in digital currencies and small mistakes during the development of SC on immutable blockchains have already caused substantial losses and involve the danger for future incidents. Hence, today the secure development of smart contracts is an important topic and several attacks and incidents related to vulnerable smart contracts could have been avoided. To foster a secure development process of SC this paper summarizes known vulnerabilities in smart contracts found by literature research and analysis. It compares currently available code analysis tools for their capabilities to identify and detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts based on a taxonomy for vulnerabilities. Finally, based on the TheDOA attack the paper shows an example for the adoption of best practices to avoid severe vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

AB The trust anchors defined in the DNSSEC and SSL architecture make the governance of the Internet very rigidly aligned with the domain name registrars and the software vendors. The root certification authorities (root CAs) are defined ultimately and built into the software key stores of an end-user. However, the end-user is not given any criteria to distinguish the built-in root CAs so that he is unable to manage the default key store effectively.
   In this paper we suggest a new approach of creating a reputation score for the trusted third parties (TTPs). We evaluate each TTP based on its economic performance by counting the amount of transaction fees put on the certificate-signing transactions. Then we become able to apply different filtering algorithms to reveal the TTPs subject to automated removal from or addition to the software key stores. One of the examples - if a root or subordinate CA does not have a single buyer of SSL certificates yet, then it is not required to keep the CA in the web browser trusted certificate store.
   We make use of the Bitcoin protocol to reveal the transaction information and guarantee the integrity of the transaction database, which is managed and stored in a P2P manner. As a result, we achieve a completely dynamic and distributed reputation scoring system, where the cost of an attack is higher than the cost of normal system operation.

To resist the vector quantization (VQ) attacks and collage attacks, a linear block-chain formed based on the secret key in such a manner, than we insert the recovery information and watermark of an image block into the next block in the block-chain to obtain the watermarked image. In watermark embedded procedure, we select several high frequency coefficients in the quantized DCT block as the recovery information and embed it into image as watermark. Then, we can localize the tampered region, and apply inverse DCT transform for image recovery. Finally, experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB One of the most common types of denial of service attack on 802.11 based networks is resource depletion at AP side. APs meet such a problem through receiving flood probe or authentication requests which are forwarded by attackers whose aim are to make AP unavailable to legitimate users. The other most common type of DoS attack takes advantage of unprotected management frame. Malicious user sends deauthentication or disassociation frame permanently to disrupt the network. However 802.11w has introduced a new solution to protect management frames using WPA and WPA2, they are unprotected where WEP is used. This paper focuses on these two common attacks and proposes a solution based on letter envelop protocol and proof-of-work protocol which forces the users to solve a puzzle before completing the association process with AP. The proposed scheme is also resistant against spoofed puzzle solutions attack.

However, producer mobility management is challenging as it focuses on the named-based resolution mechanism, which applies a dynamic and direct interaction between the producer and forwarding plane. In this paper, we consider the fundamental security issues related to producer mobility in ICN. These security issues exist mainly due to the insecure interaction of producer with the network's forwarding information management system. We show that the current mobility solutions lack an adequate security mechanism and they invite severe security threats in the network (e.g., prefix hijacking and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks). To address such security threats, we propose a Blockchain based lightweight distributed mobile producer Authentication (BlockAuth) protocol to enable secure and efficient mobility management in ICN. BlockAuth authenticates the producers' prefix(es) and enforce them to express only genuine routing updates for the prefix(es) to which they are entitled to advertise. The qualitative security analysis confirms that BlockAuth is robust against various security attacks to which mobile network and blockchain are particularly vulnerable (e.g., prefix hijacking, double spending, DoS attack). Additionally, the performance evaluation of BlockAuth shows that it maintains significant performance gain compared to the state-of-the-art prefix attestation proposals. In particular, it maintains up to 94% of the network's original throughput, while it needs additional storage of just tens of megabytes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain Startups and Prospectus Regulation
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB Initial coin offerings are a new way for blockchain startups to finance project development by issuing coins or tokens in exchange for fiat money or Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. In this article, we start from the current distinction between different types of tokens and argue that it can create confusion and should be at least partially abandoned. We believe that the conceptual difference between a currency token and a tradable utility token is just the dimension of the crypto environment in which the token is spent. More specifically, 'utility tokens' combine the customer payment mechanism with the utility component and, when tradable on a secondary market, the investment one. We argue that they blur the traditional distinctions between currencies, financial assets and consumption goods. Moreover, we stress the increasing importance of online crypto exchanges. Recently some exchanges have also taken up the role of trusted intermediaries and staked their reputation on token offerings, which are termed initial exchange offerings and have gained in popularity. We therefore argue that the crypto market increasingly looks like a segment of the capital market and behaves as such. Given that tokens have a clear investment component, we show that they are tradable securities under the Prospectus Regulation. We compare the European securities regulation with its US counterpart and focus on prospectus exemptions, highlighting the great differences between Europe and the US which make Europe less amicable to blockchain startups.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISCLOSURE AND GOVERNANCE
AB This paper will revisit two existing technologies-the more traditional relational database and a newer solution, Google Sheets-for storing and sharing data over the network, and their applicability to meeting an accounting organization's business needs. These two technologies, along with blockchain, will be evaluated against a set of criteria that are essential to most business operations. Decision makers can use this framework that identifies the capabilities and shortfalls of each of these technologies to inform the most effective and appropriate technological solution for individual business opportunities. Further, the paper will address the implications on how an accounting organization addresses data governance. Lastly, a decision paradigm, based on an established set of criteria, is presented to guide an organization in choosing the most appropriate technology. In other words, no single one technology will provide the solution for all business problems.

TI A bibliometric analysis of bitcoin scientific production
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB Blockchain technology, and more specifically bitcoin (one of its foremost applications), have been receiving increasing attention in the scientific community. The first publications with bitcoin as a topic, can be traced back to 2012. In spite of this short time span, the production magnitude (1162 papers) makes it necessary to make a bibliometric study in order to observe research clusters, emerging topics, and leading scholars. Our paper is aimed at studying the scientific production only around bitcoin, excluding other blockchain applications. Thus, we restricted our search to papers indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection, whose topic is "bitcoin". This database is suitable for such diverse disciplines such as economics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. This bibliometric study draws the landscape of the current state and trends of bitcoin-related research in different scientific disciplines.

AB Internet of Things have brought exciting changes in the social norms, work environments and the prospects for future generations. These devices (Things) have already changed the way our networks are used for communication. With the introduction of machine to machine communication (M2M), where devices communicate without human involvement to perform routine day to day tasks. These tasks on one hand, include services that provide convenience to the device owners such as setting off alarms, acting as personal assistant for reminders, keeping track of daily activities etc. On the other hand, there are certain tasks where these devices perform Transactions on behalf of the owners i.e. financial transactions/online ordering etc. These transactional tasks have significant legal implications if some problem / dispute arises due to such action performed by these devices on behalf of the owners. To ensure that these interactions take place under observation of the owners and to keep track of their occurrence, there is a need to keep record of all such communication. We propose use of Blockchain for tracking all these transactions without compromising secrecy of data by keeping its integrity intact for medico-legal requirements and prevent risk of fraud.

TI Banking malware and the laundering of its profits
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB Banking malware is malicious software that aims to steal money from victims via manipulated bank transfers in online banking. This paper describes how the profits of banking malware are generated and subsequently laundered, with a particular focus on the use of bitcoins and other digital payment methods. Computers are infected with banking malware via phishing emails, in which people are persuaded in various ways to click on links or open attachments, or via exploit kits, programs that try to find weak spots in the security of computer systems. After infection, bank transfers of the online banking accounts of victims are manipulated via fake website screens (web injects). Behind the screens the amounts and beneficiaries of transactions are modified, emptying the victims' bank accounts. In the next step, the banking malware profits are laundered. In this paper we describe two models that are used in particular (next to more traditional money laundering methods). The first model involves the use of money mules and a quick cash-out. The second model focuses on direct spending via (a) direct purchases of products via online shopping, (b) direct purchases of bitcoins via Bitcoin exchanges or (c) direct purchases of luxury goods. Bitcoins can be further laundered via so-called mixing services. All in all, these methods allow criminals to launder profits in relative anonymity and prevent seizure of the illegal profits.

AB As the underlying technology of bitcoin, blockchain is expected to create a new economic system by revolutionizing the way we communicate over the internet. Blockchain seeks to improve information security and transparency by sharing encrypted data among peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Due to its emphasis on security and trust, there is increased demand for blockchain's application in a variety of business sectors. The decentralized nature of blockchain creates the new concept of a token economy in which the community's revenue can be allocated to the actual content producers and service users who create value. This article looks at how blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are evolving and interconnected, creating a token economy through different business models.

TI Monetizing new music ventures through blockchain: Four possible futures?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION
AB The article examines the rapidly developing area of blockchain finance as a potential opportunity for new creative ventures to obtain external investment funding and generate revenues. We focus on the music industry, as an example of how alternative Internet-based finance utilizing blockchain could provide opportunities for start-up funding and ongoing revenue streams. Our pioneering pilot research findings are drawn from literature review and emerging case studies, and are grounded in the academic literature of start-up funding gaps. Although some expect blockchain technology to remove intermediaries, facilitating a direct relationship between artist and fan, initial findings are that intermediation in some form will remain. The article's central focus is the crucial emerging role of these facilitator organizations - the new breed of financial intermediaries or 'infomediaries'. We examine this evolving process through adoption and development of financial intermediation theory, exploring the wider financial intermediary concept of incubators and accelerators as expert investors and promoters of new and very early-stage ventures - including artists. The article poses the question of whether blockchain technology offers a new, more cooperative approach for creative ventures, or merely the reinvention of existing corporate structures, for instance, the three major record labels that currently dominate recorded music. The article identifies four possible paths for the adoption of blockchain technology within the music industry, ranging from the anarcho-libertarian to the corporate and from the 'utopian' to the 'dystopian'.

TI Smart libraries: an emerging and innovative technological habitat of
   21st century
SO ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss the emerging and innovative technologies which integrate together to form smart libraries. Smart libraries are the new generation libraries, which work with the amalgamation of smart technologies, smart users and smart services. Design/methodology/approach An extensive review of literature on "smart libraries" was carried to ascertain the emerging technologies in the smart library domain. Clarivate Analytic's Web of Science and Sciverse Scopus were explored initially to ascertain the extent of literature published on Smart Libraries and their varied aspects. Literature was searched against various keywords like smart libraries, smart technologies, Internet of Things (IoT), Electronic resource management (ERM), Data mining, Artificial intelligence (AI), Ambient intelligence, Blockchain Technology and Augmented Reality. Later on, the works citing the literature on Smart Libraries were also explored to visualize a broad spectrum of emerging concepts about this growing trend in libraries. Findings The study confirms that smart libraries are becoming smarter with the emerging smart technologies, which enhances their working capabilities and satisfies the users associated with them. Implementing the smart technologies in the libraries has bridged the gap between the services offered by the libraries and the rapidly changing and competing needs of the humans. Originality/value The paper tries to highlight the current technologies in the smart library set-ups for the efficient working of library set-ups.

The blockchain uses a distributed network to ensure data availability and uses public ledgers to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data. Design/methodology/approach The proposed architecture uses a blockchain technology to provide secure sharing of data in the security zone while maintaining the integrity, confidentiality and availability of data. The blockchain uses a distributed network to ensure data availability and uses public ledgers to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data. Findings Analysis of the proposed architecture with a use case scenario demonstrates that it provides a robust security measure against unauthorized network intrusions. Originality/value Unlike the existing security zone, this paper adopts a method of storing data by using blockchain. It meets the need to study integrated authentication management methods of future research.

TI SSChain: A full sharding protocol for public blockchain without data
   migration overhead
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Blockchain, known as distributed ledger technology, suffers from the scalability problem. A major approach to overcoming this limitation is using sharding, which divides the network into multiple smaller groups, called shards, these shards can work in parallel on disjoint transactions and maintain disjoint ledgers. Existing sharding-based protocols rely on reshuffling scheme to maintain security, however, since each shard only maintains a disjoint ledger, reshuffling the network will cause huge data migration. In this work, we propose SSChain, a novel non-reshuffling structure that supports both transaction sharding and state sharding. Our empirical evaluations suggest that SSChain can process more than 6,500 TPS in a network of 1,800 nodes without any data migration overhead. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cooperative and Distributed Computation Offloading for
   Blockchain-Empowered Industrial Internet of Things
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Offloading computation-intensive blockchain mining tasks to the edge servers (ESs) is a promising solution for blockchain-empowered Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) because the computing capabilities in IIoT are usually limited, whereas the blockchain mining tasks are computationally intensive. However, the computation offloading solutions for data processing tasks and for blockchain mining tasks have been studied separately. Moreover, most of the existing solutions for offloading assume that all IIoT devices can directly connect to the ESs or cloud data centers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multihop cooperative and distributed computation offloading algorithm that considers the data processing tasks and the mining tasks together for blockchain-empowered IIoT. First, we study the multihop computation offloading problem for both the data processing tasks and the mining tasks to minimize the economic cost of IIoT devices. Second, we formulate the offloading problem as a potential game in which the IIoT devices can make their decisions autonomously and prove the existence of Nash equilibrium (NE) for the game. Third, we design an efficient distributed algorithm based on exchanging messages between IIoT devices to achieve the NE with low computational complexity. Lastly, our experimental results demonstrate that our distributed algorithm scales well as the number of IIoT devices increases and has the minimum system cost compared with other approaches.

TI Best practices in digital health literacy
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
AB The connection between health literacy and health outcomes includes access and utilization of healthcare services, patient/provider interaction and self-care. Digital approaches can be designed to simplify or expand on a concept, test for understanding, and do not have a time constraint. New technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain can move the role of technology beyond data collection to a more integrated system. Rather than being a passive participant, digital solutions provide the opportunity for the individual to be an active participant in their health. These solutions can be delivered in a way that builds or enhances the individual's belief that the plan will be successful and more confidence that they can stick with it. Digital solutions allow for the delivery of multi-media education, such as videos, voice, and print, at different reading levels, in multiple languages, using formal and informal teaching methods. By giving the patient a greater voice and empowering them to be active participants in their care, they can develop their decision making and shared decision making skills. The first step in our health literacy instructional model is to address the emotional state of the person. Once the emotional state has been addressed, and an engagement strategy has been deployed the final phase is the delivery of an educational solution. While a clear definition of health literacy and an instructional model are important, further research must be done to continually determine more effective ways to incorporate health technology in the process of improving health outcomes.

SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The blooming trend of smart grid deployment is engaged by the evolution of the network technology, as the connected environment offers various alternatives for electrical data collections. Having diverse data sharing/transfer means is deemed an important aspect in enabling intelligent controls/governance in smart grid. However, security and privacy concerns also are introduced while flexible communication services are provided, such as energy depletion and infrastructure mapping attacks. This paper proposes a model permissioned blockchain edge model for smart grid network (PBEM-SGN) to address the two significant issues in smart grid, privacy protections, and energy security, by means of combining blockchain and edge computing techniques. We use group signatures and covert channel authorization techniques to guarantee users' validity. An optimal security-aware strategy is constructed by smart contracts running on the blockchain. Our experiments have evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Specifically, we are interested in testing whether the examined coins and tokens are efficient or not but we also compare the levels of efficiency within the cryptomarket. To do so, we utilize the Efficiency Index comprising the long-range dependence, fractal dimension and entropy components. Focusing on a set of historical currencies - Bitcoin, DASH, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and Stellar - as well as popular currencies and tokens of the last year (with market capitalization above $0.5 billion), we uncover some surprising results. First, the historical currencies are unanimously inefficient over the analyzed period. Second, efficiency itself and ranking as well are dependent on the denomination (the US dollar or Bitcoin). Third, most of the coins and tokens were efficient between July 2017 and June 2018. And fourth, the least efficient coins turn out to be Ethereum and Litecoin whereas DASH is the winner as the most efficient cryptocurrency. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These new vertices, also thought of as "transactions", are issued by many players (which are the nodes of the network), independently. The main application of this model is that it is used as a base for the IOTA cryptocurrency system.(1) We prove existence of "almost symmetric" Nash equilibria for the system where a part of players tries to optimize their attachment strategies. Then, we also present simulations that show that the "selfish" players will nevertheless cooperate with the network by choosing attachment strategies that are similar to the "recommended" one.

TI Road traffic bottleneck analysis for expressway for safety under
   disaster events using blockchain machine learning
SO SAFETY SCIENCE
AB To analyze the largest capacity of expressway network, the concept of road network bottleneck and its analyzing method are presented. Based on the bottleneck theory in Graphics, road network bottleneck is defined, and Ford-Fulkerson method and super origin-destination, short for OD, method are adopted for analysis of single OD and multiple OD road networks respectively. With Beijing-Hongkong-Macau expressway in Anyang-Xinxiang road network, Henan province, as a case study, application of road network bottleneck was investigated in aspects of network entrance management, network congestion points analysis and traffic assignment. For overall analysis of the congestion points in road network, the concept of bottlenecks chain corridor was presented. Bottlenecks chain corridors are key corridors for traffic diversion under disastrous events, which have major impact on the operation of road network. The case study indicates that road network bottleneck and bottlenecks chain corridor have significant value in expressway network operation management.

TI Can Blockchain technologies help tackle the opioid epidemic: A Narrative
   Review
SO PAIN MEDICINE
AB Objective. To introduce the basic concepts of blockchain technologies in tackling the opioid epidemic. Design. A narrative review. Setting/Background. The opioid epidemic is taking a big toll in terms of lives and livelihood in America. Various public and private sector agencies are actively implementing different strategies to contain the epidemic. Development of robust real-time databases that are secure and easily accessible to the stakeholders in the opioid/paincare ecosystem is essential. Blockchain technologies, with their inherent features of decentralization, immutability, and easy access are well suited to achieving these goals. Some practical applications of blockchain technologies include data collection/aggregation/analysis, patient/provider identification, traceability/monitoring of opioids, supply chain provenance, prescription monitoring, licensure and credentialing, interoperability, seamless integration/communication, development of opioid alternatives, and research incentivization. Conclusions. Blockchain technologies may help support the efforts of different agencies in curtailing the opioid epidemic.

TI BlockSecIoTNet: Blockchain-based decentralized security architecture for
   IoT network
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB The exponential growth of the use of insecure stationary and portable devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) network of the smart city has made the security of the smart city against cyber-attacks a vital issue. Various mechanisms for detecting security attacks that rely on centralized and distributed architectures have already been proposed, but they tend to be inefficient due to such problems as storage constraints, the high cost of computation, high latency, and a single point of failure. Moreover, existing security mechanisms are faced with the issue of monitoring and collecting historic data throughout the entire IoT network of the smart city in order to deliver optimal security and defense against cyberattacks. To address the current challenges, this paper proposes a decentralized security architecture based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) coupled with a blockchain technology for IoT network in the smart city that relies on the three core technologies of SDN, Blockchain, and Fog and mobile edge computing in order to detect attacks in the IoT network more effectively. Thus, in the proposed architecture, SDN is liable to continuous monitoring and analysis of traffic data in the entire IoT network in order to provide an optimal attack detection model; Blockchain delivers decentralized attack detection to mitigate the "single point of failure" problem inherent to the existing architecture; and Fog and mobile edge computing supports attack detection at the fog node and, subsequently, attack mitigation at the edge node, thus enabling early detection and mitigation with lesser storage constraints, cheaper computation, and low latency. To validate the performance of the proposed architecture, it was subjected to an experimental evaluation, the results of which show that it outperforms both centralized and distributed architectures in terms of accuracy and detection time.

TI Configurations of platform organizations: Implications for complementor
   engagement
SO RESEARCH POLICY
AB Digital platforms are an organizational form made up of a technological architecture and governance mechanisms for managing autonomous complementors. A platform's success depends on their engagement in value creation and capture. Prior studies of such engagement have mainly focused on a platform's governance mechanisms without recognizing their interdependence to its technological architecture. There is therefore a limited understanding of how the interplay between governance and architecture configures platform organizations, and why these configurations produce different levels of complementor engagement. In this paper, our analysis of a 12-year study of a shared platform initiative yields three configurations of platform organizations: vertical, horizontal, and modular. Based on these configurations, we develop propositions that theorize the implications of these organizational forms for complementor engagement. We further propose that these insights, which we derive from a shared platform, are particularly relevant for blockchain-based platforms.

Dollars are supplied by a central bank to achieve its inflation target, while the Bitcoin supply grows deterministically. Our fundamental pricing equation implies in its simplest form that Bitcoin prices form a martingale. "Mutual impatience" implies absence of speculation. Price volatility therefore does not invalidate the medium-of-exchange function. Bitcoin block rewards are not a tax on Bitcoin holders: they are financed with a Dollar tax. We discuss monetary policy implications, Bitcoin production, taxation, welfare and entry, and characterize the range of equilibria. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Low powered blockchain consensus protocols based on consistent hash
SO FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB Current blockchain consensus protocols have a triangle of contradictions in aspects of decentralization, security, and energy consumption, and cannot be synchronously optimized. We describe a design of two new blockchain consensus protocols, called "CHB-consensus" and "CHBD-consensus," based on a consistent hash algorithm. Honest miners can fairly gain the opportunity to create blocks. They do not consume any extra computational power resources when creating new blocks, and such blocks can obtain the whole blockchain network to confirm consensus with fairness. However, malicious miners have to pay massive computational power resources for attacking the new block creation privilege or double-spending. Blockchain networks formed by CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus are based on the same security assumption as that in Bitcoin systems, so they save a huge amount of power without sacrificing decentralization or security. We analyze possible attacks and give a rigorous but adjustable validation strategy. CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus introduce a certification authority (CA) system, which does not have special management or control rights over blockchain networks or data structures, but carries the risk of privacy breaches depending on credibility and reliability of the CA system. Here, we analyze the robustness and energy consumption of CHB-consensus and CHBD-consensus, and demonstrate their advantages through theoretical derivation.

TI The importance of behavioral data to identify online fake reviews for
   tourism businesses: a systematic review
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB In the last several decades, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) has been widely used by consumers on different digital platforms to gather feedback about products and services from previous customer behavior. However, this useful information is getting blurred by fake reviews-i.e., reviews that were created artificially and are thus not representative of real customer opinions. The present study aims to thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of fake online reviews in the tourism sector on social networking and online reviews sites. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on fake reviews for tourism businesses. Our focus was on previous studies that addressed the following two main topics: (i) tourism (ii) fake reviews. Scientific databases were used to collect relevant literature. The search terms "tourism" and "fake reviews" were applied. The database of Web of Science produced a total of 124 articles and, after the application of different filters following the PRISMA 2009 Flow diagram, the process resulted in the selection of 17 studies. Our results demonstrate that (i) the analysis of fake reviews is interdisciplinary, ranging from Computer Science to Business and Management, (ii) the methods are based on algorithms and sentiment analysis, while other methodologies are rarely used; and (iii) the current and future state of fraudulent detection is based on emotional approaches, semantic analysis and new technologies such as Blockchain. This study also provides helpful strategies to counteract the ubiquity of fake reviews for tourism businesses.

TI A blockchain-based computation offloading method for edge computing in
   5G networks
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Edge computing (EC) emerges as a novel computing paradigm to offload computing tasks from user equipments (UEs) to edge notes (ENs) in fifth-generation networks, which definitely breaks the resource limitation of UEs to a certain degree. However, it is troublesome to guarantee the overall operating performance of ENs due to the uneven distributed resource demands of UEs, the resulting transmission delay and the data loss for computation offloading between the covered EN and the deployed destination EN. In view of this challenge, a blockchain-based computation offloading method, named BCO, is proposed in this paper. Technically, since blockchain is a promising technique for the decentralized system, a blockchain-based EC framework is designed to degrade the data loss possibility by integrating blockchain and EC. Then, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm, the third version (NSGA-III), is leveraged to acquire the balanced offloading strategies. Furthermore, by taking advantage of Simple Additive Weighting and Multiple Criteria Decision Making, the optimal offloading strategy is identified. Finally, systematic experiments and analyses on the comparative experiment are conducted to verify the efficiency of our proposed method BCO.

TI Strong anonymous mobile payment against curious third-party provider
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB M-commerce provides convenient services and has developed rapidly in recent years. But security and privacy have always been major concerns for most users. Among existing payment systems, PayPal as well as Alipay has a third-party payment provider (TPP) but does not provide anonymity. Bitcoin provides anonymity but its decentralized framework without TPP causes high energy consumption and security attack issues. Further information can be deduced from the public decentralized ledger, Bitcoin cannot offer strong privacy guarantees. Therefore, unifying strong anonymity, security and efficiency is challenging in mobile payment. This paper proposes a strong anonymous mobile payment against a curious third-party provider (SATP). A ticket as a new means of payment is partially blindly signed by TPP using certificateless cryptographic primitives. SATP can ensure confidentiality of payment data, non-repudiation and revocation of payment operation, and anonymity of payer's identity. Especially, it can enable a user to pay anonymously even in face of a curious TPP. Performance analysis shows that SATP avoids high energy consumption like Bitcoin, and its communication cost is less than that of the existing anonymous research work.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB The rapid development of cryptocurrencies has drawn attention to this particular market, with investors trying to understand its behaviour and researchers trying to explain it. The evolution of cryptocurrencies' prices showed a kind of bubble and a crash at the end of 2017. Based on this event, and on the fact that Bitcoin is the most recognized cryptocurrency, we propose to evaluate the contagion effect between Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. Using the Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis correlation coefficient (Delta rho DCCA) and comparing the period after and before the crash, we found evidence of a contagion effect, with this particular market being more integrated now than in the past-something that should be taken into account by current and potential investors.

TI An Attribute-Based Access Control Model in RFID Systems Based on
   Blockchain Decentralized Applications for Healthcare Environments
SO COMPUTERS
AB The growing adoption of Radio-frequency Identification (RFID) systems, particularly in the healthcare field, demonstrates that RFID is a positive asset for healthcare institutions. RFID offers the ability to save organizations time and costs by enabling data of traceability, identification, communication, temperature and location in real time for both people and resources. However, the RFID systems challenges are financial, technical, organizational and above all privacy and security. For this reason, recent works focus on attribute-based access control (ABAC) schemes. Currently, ABAC are based on mostly centralized models, which in environments such as the supply chain can present problems of scalability, synchronization and trust between the parties. In this manuscript, we implement an ABAC model in RFID systems based on a decentralized model such as blockchain. Common criteria for the selection of the appropriate blockchain are detailed. Our access control policies are executed through the decentralized application (DApp), which interfaces with the blockchain through the smart contract. Smart contracts and blockchain technology, on the one hand, solve current centralized systems issues as well as being flexible infrastructures that represent the relationship of trust and support essential in the ABAC model in order to provide the security of RFID systems. Our system has been designed for a supply chain environment with an use case suitable for healthcare systems, so that assets such as surgical instruments containing an associated RFID tag can only access to specific areas. Our system is deployed in both a local and Testnet environment in order to stablish a deep comparison and determining the technical feasibility.

TI What Coins Lead in the Cryptocurrency Market: Using Copula and Neural
   Networks Models
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Exploring dependence structures between financial time series has been important within a wide range of applications. The main aim of this paper is to examine dependence relationships among five well-known cryptocurrencies-Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Stella-by a copula directional dependence (CDD). By employing a neural network autoregression model to avoid the serial dependence in each individual cryptocurrency, we generate residuals of the fitted models with time series of daily log-returns in percentage of the five cryptocurrencies and then we apply a Gaussian copula marginal beta regression model to the residuals to explore the CDD. The results show that the CDD from Bitcoin to Litecoin is highest among all ordered directional dependencies and the CDDs from Ethereum to the other four cryptocurrencies are relatively higher than the CDDs to Ethereum from those cryptocurrencies. This finding implies that the return shocks of Bitcoin have the most effect on Litecoin and the return shocks of Ethereum relatively influence the shocks on the other four cryptocurrencies instead of being affected by them. This allows investors to build the market-timing strategies by observing the directional flow of return shocks among cryptocurrencies.

TI Toward Privacy and Regulation in Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrencies
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Privacy is supreme in cryptocurrencies since most users do not want to reveal their identities or the transaction amount in financial transactions. Nevertheless, achieving privacy in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies remains challenging since blockchain is by default a public ledger. For instance, Bitcoin provides builtin pseudonymity rather than true anonymity, which can be compromised by analyzing the transactions. Several solutions have been proposed to enhance the transaction privacy of Bitcoin. Unfortunately, full anonymity is not always desirable, because malicious users are able to conduct illegal transactions, such as money laundering and drug trading, under the cover of anonymity in cryptocurrencies. As a result, regulation in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies is very essential. In this article, we analyze the privacy issues in Bitcoin and investigate some existing privacy-enhancing techniques in blockchain-based cryptocurrencies as well as some privacy-focused altcoins. In addition, we review and compare some works dealing with regulation of cryptocurrencies. Finally, we propose two possible solutions from a top view to balance privacy and regulation of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. One solution is based on decentralized group signature, in which a group manager is responsible for building a group and tracing the real payer of the group in a transaction. The other solution is based on verifiable encryption, in which a tracing manager is not actively involved in normal transactions but can trace suspicious transactions via an encrypted tag.

The article analyzes biometrics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain as part of a technological assemblage, which I term the biometric assemblage. The article identifies five intersecting logics that explain wider transformations within the humanitarian sector and in turn shape the biometric assemblage. The acceleration of the rate of biometric registrations in the humanitarian sector between 2002 and 2019 reveals serious concerns regarding bias, data safeguards, data-sharing practices with states and commercial companies, experimentation with untested technologies among vulnerable people, and, finally, ethics. Technological convergence amplifies risks associated with each constituent technology of the biometric assemblage. The article finally argues that the biometric assemblage accentuates asymmetries between refugees and humanitarian agencies and ultimately entrenches inequalities in a global context.

TI Blockchain and the built environment: Potentials and limitations
SO JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.

AB Researches in Blockchain Technology (BCT) and Internet of Things (IoT) are experiencing exponential growth in recent years. They are being witnessed as mainstream technologies that have the potential of revolutionizing our society. However, these two contain technologically unrelated in philosophies. This article has a special interest in exploring how BCT and IoT can benefit in innovating business models. The purpose of this work is to understand the state of the art how BCT can be utilized within IoT context to create secure decentralized architecture. IoT is not secure by design, making its applications vulnerable especially to security and privacy threats. This hinders the proliferation of IoT applications in a large scale. With BCT capabilities, BCT can be used as integral part that can solve many shortcomings of IoT applications. Thus, existing businesses can be improved, and new business models can be brought into reality. Eliminating the need of third parties to guarantee trust of business transactions is a significant value towards business innovation in many areas, such as digital supply chain, vehicular systems, surveillance systems, and the creation of new business models, e.g. sharing economy, local energy trading, smart city, to name but a few. In an effort to understand the state of the art, this article (1) highlights intrinsic characteristics of IoT, (2) describes BCT modes and their characteristics to be considered for IoT integration, (3) presents a comprehensive survey on business opportunities based on the usage of BCT and IoT from a wide variety of literatures, (4) analyse strengths and weaknesses, and (5) discusses research possibilities that can be a solution to the problems. This paper will serve as a good starting and reference point to new researchers or those who are interested in adopting these technologies in businesses.

TI Price overreactions in the cryptocurrency market
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine price overreactions in the case of the following cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, litecoin, ripple and dash. Design/methodology/approach A number of parametric (t-test, ANOVA, regression analysis with dummy variables) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U-test) tests confirm the presence of price patterns after overreactions: the next day price changes in both directions are bigger than after "normal" days. A trading robot approach is then used to establish whether these statistical anomalies can be exploited to generate profits. Findings The results suggest that a strategy based on counter-movements after overreactions is not profitable, whilst one based on inertia appears to be profitable but produces outcomes not statistically different from the random ones. Therefore, the overreactions detected in the cryptocurrency market do not give rise to exploitable profit opportunities (possibly because of transaction costs) and cannot be seen as evidence against the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). Originality/value The overreactions detected in the cryptocurrency market do not give rise to exploitable profit opportunities (possibly because of transaction costs) and cannot be seen as evidence against the EMH.

TI BArt: Trading digital contents through digital assets
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Since digital artworks are indeed digital content, they face the inherent problem digital content has: the link between content and its original author is very difficult to keep. Additionally, retaining control over digital copies of the content is also a challenging task. Digital coins have solved this very same problem through cryptocurrencies (for instance, Bitcoin) and have opened the door to apply the same techniques to other similar scenarios where ownership of digital assets needs to be preserved. In this paper, we propose BArt, a transparent and distributed mechanism for artists to commercialize their digital artwork, keeping control of the copies, monetizing its usage, and maintaining ownership. BArt allows artists to publicly register their work in the Bitcoin blockchain and sell usage rights in exchange for bitcoins. Buyers are allowed to exert the acquired rights. Proper behavior from all parties is enforced by the system with cryptography and economic incentives.

Accounts acting on the blockchain are represented as nodes, while the interactions among these accounts, recorded on the blockchain, are treated as links in the network. Using this representation, it is possible to derive interesting mathematical characteristics that improve the understanding of the actual interactions happening in the blockchain. Not only, by looking at the history of the blockchain, it is possible to verify if radical changes in the blockchain evolution happened.

TI Privacy-Preserving Methods for Feature Engineering Using Blockchain:
   Review, Evaluation, and Proof of Concept
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: The protection of private data is a key responsibility for research studies that collect identifiable information from study participants. Limiting the scope of data collection and preventing secondary use of the data are effective strategies for managing these risks. An ideal framework for data collection would incorporate feature engineering, a process where secondary features are derived from sensitive raw data in a secure environment without a trusted third party.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare current approaches based on how they maintain data privacy and the practicality of their implementations. These approaches include traditional approaches that rely on trusted third parties, and cryptographic, secure hardware, and blockchain-based techniques.
   Methods: A set of properties were defined for evaluating each approach. A qualitative comparison was presented based on these properties. The evaluation of each approach was framed with a use case of sharing geolocation data for biomedical research.
   Results: We found that approaches that rely on a trusted third party for preserving participant privacy do not provide sufficiently strong guarantees that sensitive data will not be exposed in modern data ecosystems. Cryptographic techniques incorporate strong privacy-preserving paradigms but are appropriate only for select use cases or are currently limited because of computational complexity. Blockchain smart contracts alone are insufficient to provide data privacy because transactional data are public. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) may have hardware vulnerabilities and lack visibility into how data are processed. Hybrid approaches combining blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and TEEs provide promising frameworks for privacy preservation. For reference, we provide a software implementation where users can privately share features of their geolocation data using the hybrid approach combining blockchain with TEEs as a supplement.
   Conclusions: Blockchain technology and smart contracts enable the development of new privacy-preserving feature engineering methods by obviating dependence on trusted parties and providing immutable, auditable data processing workflows. The overlap between blockchain and cryptographic techniques or blockchain and secure hardware technologies are promising fields for addressing important data privacy needs. Hybrid blockchain and TEE frameworks currently provide practical tools for implementing experimental privacy-preserving applications.

TI Understanding speculative investment behavior in the Bitcoin context
   from a dual-systems perspective
SO INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT & DATA SYSTEMS
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine users' decision-making mechanism of speculative investment behavior and its sequential consequences in the Bitcoin context from a dual-systems perspective. Design/methodology/approach Original data were collected via a survey of 334 participants with experience in Bitcoin speculative investment. The partial least squares method was used to test the proposed model. Findings Speculative investment behavior in the Bitcoin context is driven by strong impulse and weak self-control, leading to negative consequences. The extent of the imbalance between the two cognitive systems is greater with the subjective norm than without it, thus facilitating speculative investment behavior. Noteworthy differences in the impulse and self-control effects on Bitcoin speculative investment are found with differences in Bitcoin objective and subjective knowledge. Originality/value This study is the first attempt to empirically investigate users' decision-making mechanism used when speculating in Bitcoin.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCIES IN FINANCE: REVIEW AND APPLICATIONS
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FINANCE
AB The literature has recently begun to investigate the properties of cryptocurrency markets to identify key drivers for the use of cryptocurrencies in investment strategies. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the financial applications of Bitcoin. The focus is on three lines of research: price formation, detection of market inefficiency, and diversified portfolio construction. Topics such as market micro-structure and the interplay between different cryptocurrencies are only touched on briefly. We observe that many empirical studies find that Bitcoin markets are inefficient, with huge price fluctuations and long-range memory, and that these markets are heavily influenced by news and sector-specific events, or by infrastructure conditions such as volume trading and market liquidity. Nevertheless, astonishing price appreciations and modest correlation values versus other asset classes have contributed significantly to motivate applications of Bitcoin to investment and diversification. Future research may address practical implementations of such solutions and investigate the long-term sustainability and viability of these investment strategies.

TI Block withholding game among bitcoin mining pools
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Although mining pools smooth out Bitcoin rewards and make it more predictable for an individual miner, they concentrate power to the pool's operator. There are multiple huge mining pools, and each of them may possess up to 30% of the total computation power of the Bitcoin network (the same applies to some other altcoins). Putting such enormous computation power in the hands of pool operators provides the necessary incentive for them to misuse their power over the network. One way to misuse this power is to launch a block withholding attack against other mining pools. Indeed, this ability starts a block withholding game among the pool operators. Some researchers have analyzed such a game. However, their analyses were limited because they considered simple scenarios, e.g., a single-shot game between only two mining pools. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the block withholding game is a stochastic game with finitely many states and actions. Then, we use a reinforcement learning method to analyze this game. Our simulation results show that in the recent four years, by launching a block withholding attack some pools had the potential to reach to the majority (51%) of the total computation power of the network with much lower initial computation power (even with less than 25% of the total computation power of the network).

The HOMO-LUMO transitions, frontier molecular orbitals, dipole moment, and electron charges distribution were computed using density functional theory (DFT) for each tautomer. The absorption and transmission spectra were experimentally obtained under certain solutions and concentration. The results showed that functional groups play a significant role in the formation of tautomers. Further, the energy gap for NPP was calculated experimentally and found to be 3.79 eV. The energy gap was increased substantially by replacing nitro group with N,N-dimethylamino group (DAPP) to be 3.99 eV. The theoretical calculations results were completely agreed with the experimental data, and proved for the first time, proton transfer from nitrogen to carbon with loss of aromaticity in pyrazole dye.

TI Which one is more informative in determining price movements of hedging
   assets? Evidence from Bitcoin, gold and crude oil markets
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this paper, we aim to identify which one is more informative in determining the price fluctuations in a system consisting of three commonly used hedging assets, i.e. Bitcoin, gold and crude oil. Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA), multivariate GARCH (MVGARCH) and information share (IS) analysis are utilized to achieve this purpose. The empirical results show that, firstly the MF-DCCA suggests that obvious multifractality exists in the cross-correlations among the three hedging assets and Bitcoin is more susceptible to price fluctuations from gold and crude oil markets. Secondly the results from DCC-MVGARCH model indicate that, although significant volatility spillovers are detected among the three assets, the spillover effects from gold and crude oil markets to Bitcoin market are much stronger than other spillovers. Additionally, the dynamic correlations between gold and crude oil markets are almost positive, while those between Bitcoin and gold, and those between Bitcoin and oil markets are nearly negative during the whole sample periods. Finally, the information share analysis further confirms that gold market dominates crude oil and Bitcoin markets in absorbing new information and contributes more explanatory power in price movements/variance of the hedging assets system.

TI DNS-IdM: A Blockchain Identity Management System to Secure Personal Data
   Sharing in a Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Identity management (IdM) is a method used to determine user identities. The centralized aspect of IdM introduces a serious concern with the growing value of personal information, as well as with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The problem with currently-deployed systems and their dominating approach, with identity providers (IdP) and single-point services, is that a third party is in charge of maintaining and controlling the personal data. The main challenge to manage data securely lies in trusting humans and institutes who are responsible for controlling the entire activity. Identities are not owned by the rightful owners or the user him/herself, but by the mentioned providers. With the rise of blockchain technology, self-sovereign identities are in place utilizing decentralization; unfortunately, the flaws still exist. In this research, we propose DNS-IdM, a smart contract-based identity management system that enables users to maintain their identities associated with certain attributes, accomplishing the self-sovereign concept. DNS-IdM has promising outcomes in terms of security and privacy. Due to the decentralized nature, DNS-IdM is able to avoid not only the conventional security threats, but also the limitations of the current decentralized identity management systems.

TI Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the
   exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry
SO COMPUTERS IN INDUSTRY
AB Blockchain is becoming a widespread digital technology that allows every transaction to be tracked in an inviolable way, hence making it possible to go back through the entire history of products and product components. Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure.

TI Online Deep Reinforcement Learning for Computation Offloading in
   Blockchain-Empowered Mobile Edge Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB Offloading computation-intensive tasks (e.g., blockchain consensus processes and data processing tasks) to the edge/cloud is a promising solution for blockchain-empowered mobile edge computing. However, the traditional offloading approaches (e.g., auction-based and game-theory approaches) fail to adjust the policy according to the changing environment and cannot achieve long-term performance. Moreover, the existing deep reinforcement learning-based offloading approaches suffer from the slow convergence caused by high-dimensional action space. In this paper, we propose a new model-free deep reinforcement learning-based online computation offloading approach for blockchain-empowered mobile edge computing in which both mining tasks and data processing tasks are considered. First, we formulate the online offloading problem as a Markov decision process by considering both the blockchain mining tasks and data processing tasks. Then, to maximize long-term offloading performance, we leverage deep reinforcement learning to accommodate highly dynamic environments and address the computational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive genetic algorithm into the exploration of deep reinforcement learning to effectively avoid useless exploration and speed up the convergence without reducing performance. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can converge quickly and outperform three benchmark policies.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
AB The power grid is rapidly transforming, and while recent grid innovations increased the utilization of advanced control methods, the next-generation grid demands technologies that enable the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs)-and consumers that both seamlessly buy and sell electricity. This paper develops an optimization model and blockchain-based architecture to manage the operation of crowdsourced energy systems (CESs), with peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading transactions (ETTs). An operational model of CESs in distribution networks is presented considering various types of ETT and crowdsourcees. Then, a two-phase operation algorithm is presented: Phase I focuses on the day-ahead scheduling of generation and controllable DERs, whereas Phase II is developed for hour-ahead or real-time operation of distribution networks. The developed approach supports seamless P2P energy trading between individual prosumers and/or the utility. The presented operational model can also be used to operate islanded microgrids. The CES framework and the operation algorithm are then prototyped through an efficient blockchain implementation, namely, the IBM Hyperledger Fabric. This implementation allows the system operator to manage the network users to seamlessly trade energy. Case studies and prototype illustration are provided.

However, it is challenging to implement complex hash algorithms with limited resources in IoT devices owing to large energy consumption and a long processing time. This paper proposes a RISC-V processor with memristor-based in-memory computing (IMC) for blockchain technology in IoT applications. The IMC-adapted instructions were designed for the Keccak hash algorithm by virtue of the extendibility of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). Then, a RISC-V processor with area-efficient memristor-based IMC was developed based on an open-source core for IoT applications, Hummingbird E200. The general compiling policy with the data allocation method is also disclosed for the IMC implementation of the Keccak hash algorithm. An evaluation shows that >70% improvements in both performance and energy saving were achieved with limited area overhead after introducing IMC in the RISC-V processor.

TI Dissection of Bitcoin's multiscale bubble history from January 2012 to
   February 2018
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB We present a detailed bubble analysis of the Bitcoin to US Dollar price dynamics from January 2012 to February 2018. We introduce a robust automatic peak detection method that classifies price time series into periods of uninterrupted market growth (drawups) and regimes of uninterrupted market decrease (drawdowns). In combination with the Lagrange Regularization Method for detecting the beginning of a new market regime, we identify three major peaks and 10 additional smaller peaks, that have punctuated the dynamics of Bitcoin price during the analysed time period. We explain this classification of long and short bubbles by a number of quantitative metrics and graphs to understand the main socio-economic drivers behind the ascent of Bitcoin over this period. Then, a detailed analysis of the growing risks associated with the three long bubbles using the Log-Periodic Power-Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is based on the LPPLS Confidence Indicators, defined as the fraction of qualified fits of the LPPLS model over multiple time windows. Furthermore, for various fictitious 'present' times t(2) before the crashes, we employ a clustering method to group the predicted critical times tc of the LPPLS fits over different time scales, where tc is the most probable time for the ending of the bubble. Each cluster is proposed as a plausible scenario for the subsequent Bitcoin price evolution. We present these predictions for the three long bubbles and the four short bubbles that our time scale of analysis was able to resolve. Overall, our predictive scheme provides useful information to warn of an imminent crash risk.

TI Cryptocurrency momentum effect: DFA and MF-DFA analysis
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Cryptocurrency has experienced the skyrocketing and falling back in 2018. Beyond the hype, the specific price movements of different cryptocurrencies should be investigated in a more careful way. Since the cryptocurrency market is a non-linear complex system which are not suitable analyzed by tradition methods, this paper introduces methods from econophysics. Mono-fractal analysis (detrended fluctuation analysis, DFA) is applied to investigate the price movement. Further, multi-fractal fluctuation detrended analysis (MF-DFA) is used for robustness test. Through analyzing four representative cryptocurrencies, our paper finds a strong momentum effect in BTC and ETH market, and a reversion effect in XRP and EOS when large fluctuation occurs. These findings may provide a reference for trading strategy in alternative asset allocations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain and Random Subspace Learning-Based IDS for SDN-Enabled
   Industrial IoT Security
SO SENSORS
AB The industrial control systems are facing an increasing number of sophisticated cyber attacks that can have very dangerous consequences on humans and their environments. In order to deal with these issues, novel technologies and approaches should be adopted. In this paper, we focus on the security of commands in industrial IoT against forged commands and misrouting of commands. To this end, we propose a security architecture that integrates the Blockchain and the Software-defined network (SDN) technologies. The proposed security architecture is composed of: (a) an intrusion detection system, namely RSL-KNN, which combines the Random Subspace Learning (RSL) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to defend against the forged commands, which target the industrial control process, and (b) a Blockchain-based Integrity Checking System (BICS), which can prevent the misrouting attack, which tampers with the OpenFlow rules of the SDN-enabled industrial IoT systems. We test the proposed security solution on an Industrial Control System Cyber attack Dataset and on an experimental platform combining software-defined networking and blockchain technologies. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed security solution.

TI Co-movement in crypto-currency markets: evidences from wavelet analysis
SO FINANCIAL INNOVATION
AB We study the time varying co-movement patterns of the crypto-currency prices with the help of wavelet-based methods; employing daily bilateral exchange rate of four major crypto-currencies namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lite and Dashcoin. First, we identify Bitcoin as potential market leader using Wavelet multiple correlation and Cross correlation. Further, Wavelet Local Multiple Correlation for the given crypto-currency prices are estimated across different time-scales. From the results, it is found that that the correlation follows an aperiodic cyclical nature, and the crypto-currency prices are driven by Bitcoin price movements. Based on the results obtained, we suggest that constructing a portfolio based on crypto-currencies may be risky at this point of time as the other crypto-currency prices are mainly driven by Bitcoin prices, and any shocks in the latter is immediately transformed to the former.

TI Sentiment-Based Prediction of Alternative Cryptocurrency Price
   Fluctuations Using Gradient Boosting Tree Model
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
AB In this paper, we analyze Twitter signals as a medium for user sentiment to predict the price fluctuations of a small-cap alternative cryptocurrency called ZClassic. We extracted tweets on an hourly basis for a period of 3.5 weeks, classifying each tweet as positive, neutral, or negative. We then compiled these tweets into an hourly sentiment index, creating an unweighted and weighted index, with the latter giving larger weight to retweets. These two indices, alongside the raw summations of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment were juxtaposed to similar to 400 data points of hourly pricing data to train an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Tree Model. Price predictions produced from this model were compared to historical price data, with the resulting predictions having a 0.81 correlation with the testing data. Our model's predictive data yielded statistical significance at the p < 0.0001 level. Our model is the first academic proof of concept that social media platforms such as Twitter can serve as powerful social signals for predicting price movements in the highly speculative alternative cryptocurrency, or "alt-coin," market.

AB Blockchain is considered by many to be a disruptive core technology. Although many researchers have realized the importance of blockchain, the research of blockchain is still in its infancy. Consequently, this study reviews the current academic research on blockchain, especially in the subject area of business and economics. Based on a systematic review of the literature retrieved from the Web of Science service, we explore the top-cited articles, most productive countries, and most common keywords. Additionally, we conduct a clustering analysis and identify the following five research themes: economic benefit, blockchain technology, initial coin offerings, fintech revolution, and sharing economy. Recommendations on future research directions and practical applications are also provided in this paper.

TI Forecasting in Blockchain-Based Local Energy Markets
SO ENERGIES
AB Increasingly volatile and distributed energy production challenges traditional mechanisms to manage grid loads and price energy. Local energy markets (LEMs) may be a response to those challenges as they can balance energy production and consumption locally and may lower energy costs for consumers. Blockchain-based LEMs provide a decentralized market to local energy consumer and prosumers. They implement a market mechanism in the form of a smart contract without the need for a central authority coordinating the market. Recently proposed blockchain-based LEMs use auction designs to match future demand and supply. Thus, such blockchain-based LEMs rely on accurate short-term forecasts of individual households' energy consumption and production. Often, such accurate forecasts are simply assumed to be given. The present research tested this assumption by first evaluating the forecast accuracy achievable with state-of-the-art energy forecasting techniques for individual households and then, assessing the effect of prediction errors on market outcomes in three different supply scenarios. The evaluation showed that, although a LASSO regression model is capable of achieving reasonably low forecasting errors, the costly settlement of prediction errors can offset and even surpass the savings brought to consumers by a blockchain-based LEM. This shows that, due to prediction errors, participation in LEMs may be uneconomical for consumers, and thus, has to be taken into consideration for pricing mechanisms in blockchain-based LEMs.

SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose This paper aims to explore the implications of the 2014 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) publication and guidelines on virtual currency definitions and the overall impact of blockchain technology on anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and regulation. The report cites three case study examples, which the FATF paper uses and which this paper questions as to their relevance, especially to the formal banking sector. Design/methodology/approach The paper has provided a critical analysis of a FATF publication and guideline document. Additional secondary data has been used on blockchain technology and to analyse the relevance and implications of the case studies used in the FATF document. Findings The main findings are that virtual currency technology has the potential to support AML frameworks within banking when and if they are better understood. However, generic case examples of virtual currency legal cases are not necessarily useful when developing AML risk assessment frameworks within the banking sector.
   Originality/value The originality of this paper is the topic of blockchain technology being considered in AML frameworks and the critical analysis of the FATF cases.

TI Acceptance and Penetration of Bitcoin: The Role of Psychological
   Distance and National Culture
SO SAGE OPEN
AB Previous studies showed that a number of factors play roles in influencing Bitcoin penetration and acceptance, both at country and individual level, such as trust, perceived risk, security threat, perceived benefit, perceived ease of use, as well as macro-technological and socioeconomic factors. This present study aimed at finding theoretical models at the macro- and microlevels that are able to explain the penetration and acceptance. Study 1 examined hypotheses on the predictive relationship between national cultural orientation and Bitcoin penetration involving 60 countries. Study 2, using a construal level perspective, tested the predictive strength of psychological distances against Bitcoin acceptance, involving 565 Indonesians (M-age = 28.88 years, SDage = 12.482 years). The results showed that national culture of individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation are able to predict the penetration. Spatial/physical distance, social distance, and hypothetical distance are able to predict the acceptance. This research is pivotal in obtaining the fundamental factors of community vulnerability in accepting and endorsing new e-money, i.e. Bitcoin. Monetary policy is expected to consider cultural and psychological factors in intervening against economic-technological disruptive innovations developing among societies.

TI Realization of Blockchain in Named Data Networking-Based
   Internet-of-Vehicles
SO IT PROFESSIONAL
AB The revolution of Internet-of-vehicles (IoV) has stimulated a substantial response from academia, research, and industry due to its massive potential to improve overall transportation. Current IoV faces huge challenges due to its reliance on IP-based network architecture. Therefore, named data networking (NDN) is proposed as a promising architecture to solve issues posed by IP-based systems. Recently, blockchains (BCs) have been utilized within IoV to increase network security. However, the integration of BC within NDN-enabled IoV is still an open research problem. In this study, we proposed a novel tier-based architecture known as "Blockchain in NDN-enabled Internet-of-vehicles (BINDN)," which can support BC within NDN-enabled IoV. BINDN can be used as reference architecture to design security solutions in NDN-enabled IoV using BC. Furthermore, it provides an extensive set of applications including IoV security, trust management, and privacy enhancements. Moreover, we highlighted major challenges and issues when integrating BC within NDN-enabled IoV.

TI Can uncertainty indices predict Bitcoin prices? A revisited analysis
   using partial and multivariate wavelet approaches
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB This paper uses bivariate and multivariate wavelet approaches to revisit the co-movements between the Volatility Uncertainty Index (VIX) and Bitcoin (BTC). This is achieved by accounting for the impacts of the three major global factors, namely the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU), the Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX), and the Geopolitical Risk Index (GPR). To do this, we use Wavelet Coherence (WC), Cross Wavelet Transform (CWT), Power Wavelet Coherence (PWC), and Multiple Wavelet Coherence (MWC) approaches. The results show that the BTC-VIX relationship varies across time and at high and low frequencies. Moreover, we find positive (or in-phase) co-movements between both variables while a negative co-movement (out-of-phase) is observed at both high and low frequencies. VIX news has a prediction power on BTC price returns over different frequencies. The results of PWC and MWC show that OVX, EPU, and GPR factors affect the BTC-VIX nexus under different frequencies. Finally, correlations between BTC-uncertainty indices are dependent upon investment horizons. The results of our research are of interest and importance to investors, portfolio managers, and policy-makers, as the results have practical applications to inform their decision-making.

SO GLOBAL NETWORKS-A JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB Blockchains combine digital encryption and time stamping technologies to enable digital exchange to occur in manners celebrated by proponents as 'trust-free'. Yet, an increasing range of scholars argue that actual applications of the peer-to-peer technology shifts, rather than eliminates, trust. In this article, we draw on organizational theory to argue that efforts to remove trust reorganize the action nets that underpin payment systems in manners that extend rather than eliminate longstanding pathologies afflicting financial globalization. Our analysis supports and extends the critiques that blockchain applications are far from 'trust-free'. By tracing how efforts to reconfigure the socio-technical composition of the humans and objects that underpin payment systems, we illustrate how blockchain applications shift the location and character of the technical vulnerabilities that create market instabilities and concentration, as well as elite-led governance.

TI Signatures of the Crypto-Currency Market Decoupling from the Forex
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Based on the high-frequency recordings from Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange and professional trading platform that aims to bring Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, the multiscale cross-correlations involving the Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Euro (EUR) and US dollar (USD) are studied over the period between 1 July 2016 and 31 December 2018. It is shown that the multiscaling characteristics of the exchange rate fluctuations related to the cryptocurrency market approach those of the Forex. This, in particular, applies to the BTC/ETH exchange rate, whose Hurst exponent by the end of 2018 started approaching the value of 0.5, which is characteristic of the mature world markets. Furthermore, the BTC/ETH direct exchange rate has already developed multifractality, which manifests itself via broad singularity spectra. A particularly significant result is that the measures applied for detecting cross-correlations between the dynamics of the BTC/ETH and EUR/USD exchange rates do not show any noticeable relationships. This could be taken as an indication that the cryptocurrency market has begun decoupling itself from the Forex.

AB As a distributed ledger technology, the block-chain has gained much attention from both the industrical and academical fields, but most of the existing blockchain protocols still have the cubical dilatation problem. Although the latest Rollerchain has mitigated this issue by changing the blockheader's contents, the low efficiency, severe capacity expansion and non-scalability problems still hinder the adoption of Rollerchain in practice. To this end, we present the pruneable sharding-based blockchain protocol by utilizing the sharding technique and PBFT(Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) algorithm in the improved Rollerchain, which has high efficiency, slow cubical dilatation, small capacity expansion and high scalability. Moreover, the pruneable sharding-based blockchain protocol is certifiably secure and scalable. The experimental results show the protocol has good performance.

SO CHAOS
AB The Fractional Gray Lotka-Volterra Model (FGLVM) is introduced and used for modeling the transaction counts of three cryptocurrencies, namely, Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple. The 2-dimensional study is on Bitcoin and Litecoin, while the 3-dimensional study is on Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple. Dataset from 28 April 2013 to 10 February 2018 provides forecasting values for Bitcoin and Litecoin through the 2-dimensional FGLVM study, while dataset from 7 August 2013 to 10 February 2018 provides forecasting values of Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple through the 3-dimensional FGLVM study. Forecasting values of cryptocurrencies for the n-dimensional FGLVM study, along 100 days of study time, are displayed. The graph and Lyapunov exponents of the 2-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system using the results of FGLVM reveal that the system is a chaotic dynamical system, while the 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra system displays parabolic patterns in spite of the chaos indicated by the Lyapunov exponents. The mean absolute percentage error indicates that 2-dimensional FGLVM has a good accuracy for the overall forecasting values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for the last 300 forecasting values of Litecoin, while the 3-dimensional FGLVM has a good accuracy for the overall forecasting values of Bitcoin and a reasonable accuracy for the last 300 forecasting values of both Litecoin and Ripple. Both 2- and 3-dimensional FGLVM analyses evoke a future constant trend in transacting Bitcoin and a future decreasing trend in transacting Litecoin and Ripple. Bitcoin will keep relatively higher transaction counts, with Litecoin transaction counts everywhere superior to that of Ripple.

TI A Secure Charging System for Electric Vehicles Based on Blockchain
SO SENSORS
AB Smart grids incorporating internet-of-things are emerging solutions to provide a reliable, sustainable and efficient electricity supply, and electric vehicle drivers can access efficient charging services in the smart grid. However, traditional electric vehicle charging systems are vulnerable to distributed denial of service and privileged insider attacks when the central charging server is attacked. The blockchain-based charging systems have been proposed to resolve these problems. In 2018, Huang et al. proposed the electric vehicle charging system using lightning network and smart contract. However, their system has an inefficient charging mechanism and does not guarantee security of key. We propose a secure charging system for electric vehicles based on blockchain to resolve these security flaws. Our charging system ensures the security of key, secure mutual authentication, anonymity, and perfect forward secrecy, and also provides efficient charging. We demonstrate that our proposed system provides secure mutual authentication using Burrows-Abadi-Needham logic and prevents replay and man-in-the-middle attacks using automated validation of internet security protocols and applications simulation tool. Furthermore, we compare computation and communication costs with previous schemes. Therefore, the proposed charging system efficiently applies to practical charging systems for electric vehicles.

TI Order book model with herd behavior exhibiting long-range memory
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB In this work, we propose an order book model with herd behavior. The proposed model is built upon two distinct approaches: a recent empirical study of the detailed order book records by Kanazawa et al. (2018) and financial herd behavior model. Combining these approaches allows us to propose a model that replicates the long-range memory of absolute return and trading activity. We compare the statistical properties of the model against the empirical statistical properties of the Bitcoin exchange rates and New York stock exchange tickers. We also show that the fracture in the spectral density of the high frequency absolute return time series might be related to the mechanism of convergence towards the equilibrium price.

TI Designing collaborative blockchained signature-based intrusion detection
   in IoT environments
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB With the rapid development of Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is an increasing demand for securing the IoT environments. For such purpose, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are one of the most important security mechanisms, which can help defend computer networks including IoT against various threats. In order to achieve better detection performance, collaborative intrusion detection systems or networks (CIDSs or CIDNs) are often adopted in a practical scenario, allowing a set of IDS nodes to exchange required information with each other, e.g., alarms, signatures. However, due to the distributed nature, such kind of collaborative network is vulnerable to insider attacks, i.e., malicious nodes can generate untruthful signatures and share to normal peers. This may cause intruders to be undetected and greatly degrade the effectiveness of IDSs. With the advent of blockchain technology, it provides a way to verify shared signatures (rules). In this work, our motivation is to develop CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchained signature-based IDSs, which can incrementally build and update a trusted signature database in a collaborative IoT environment. CBSigIDS can provide a verifiable manner in distributed architectures without the need of a trusted intermediary. In the evaluation, our results demonstrate that CBSigIDS can enhance the robustness and effectiveness of signature-based IDSs under adversarial scenarios. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI CReam: A Smart Contract Enabled Collusion-Resistant e-Auction
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY
AB Auction is an effective way to allocate goods or services to bidders who value them the most. The rapid growth of e-auctions facilitates online transactions but poses new and distinctive challenges. It is difficult to establish trust among sellers, buyers, and auctioneers without centralized auction websites or platforms (the auctioneer) which collect bids and derive the auction results. However, these third parties may be untrustworthy, and malicious sellers or buyers may refuse to deliver the goods or payment according to the protocol. Moreover, the open and anonymous online environment may stimulate auction participants to form collusion coalitions to rig the auction and reap unfair profit. Many auction designs have been proposed to address these concerns, but they fall short of simultaneously achieving decentralization (i.e., held without a trusted third utility), strong consensus (i.e., the establishment of trust), collusion resistance, and practical implementation. We present CReam, the first decentralized collusion-resistant e-auction system that is implemented with smart contract on the blockchain. With the carefully designed smart auction contract, mutually distrustful and rational sellers and buyers are stimulated to operate properly, hence transact safely without trusted third parties. The auction mechanism in the smart contract can effectively prevent bidder collusion and realize economic robustness, i.e., truthfulness. We implement a fully functional CReam on the Ethereum network. Extensive experimental results confirm that CReam can greatly reduce the probability of collusion and achieve an approximate optimal revenue at a low cost of contract execution.

TI The Potential of Blockchain Technology for Health Information Exchange:
   Experimental Study From Patients' Perspectives
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Nowadays, a number of mechanisms and tools are being used by health care organizations and physicians to electronically exchange the personal health information of patients. The main objectives of different methods of health information exchange (HIE) are to reduce health care costs, minimize medical errors, and improve the coordination of interorganizational information exchange across health care entities. The main challenges associated with the common HIE systems are privacy concerns, security risks, low visibility of system transparency, and lack of patient control. Blockchain technology is likely to disrupt the current information exchange models utilized in the health care industry.
   Objective: Little is known about patients' perceptions and attitudes toward the implementation of blockchain-enabled HIE networks, and it is still not clear if patients (as one of the main HIE stakeholders) are likely to opt in to the applications of this technology in HIE initiatives. Thus, this study aimed at exploring the core value of blockchain technology in the health care industry from health care consumers' views.
   Methods: To recognize the potential applications of blockchain technology in health care practices, we designed 16 information exchange scenarios for controlled Web-based experiments. Overall, 2013 respondents participated in 16 Web-based experiments. Each experiment described an information exchange condition characterized by 4 exchange mechanisms (ie, direct, lookup, patient-centered, and blockchain), 2 types of health information (ie, sensitive vs nonsensitive), and 2 types of privacy policy (weak vs strong).
   Results: The findings show that there are significant differences in patients' perceptions of various exchange mechanisms with regard to patient privacy concern, trust in competency and integrity, opt-in intention, and willingness to share information. Interestingly, participants hold a favorable attitude toward the implementation of blockchain-based exchange mechanisms for privacy protection, coordination, and information exchange purposes. This study proposed the potentials and limitations of a blockchain-based attempt in the HIE context.
   Conclusions: The results of this research should be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The findings propose potential limitations of a blockchain-based HIE that should be addressed by health care organizations to exchange personal health information in a secure and private manner. This study can contribute to the research in the blockchain area and enrich the literature on the use of blockchain in HIE efforts. Practitioners can also identify how to leverage the benefit of blockchain to promote HIE initiatives nationwide.

TI Blockchain-oriented dynamic modelling of smart contract design and
   execution in the supply chain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Recently, the applications of Blockchain technology have begun to revolutionise different aspects of supply chain (SC) management. Among others, Blockchain is a platform to execute the smart contracts in the SC as transactions. We develop and test a new model for smart contract design in the SC with multiple logistics service providers and show that this problem can be presented as a multi-processor flexible flow shop scheduling. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the execution of physical operations is modelled inside the start and completion of cyber information services. We name this modelling concept 'virtual operation'. The constructed model and the developed experimental environment constitute an event-driven dynamic approach to task and service composition when designing the smart contract. Our approach is also of value when considering the contract execution stage. The use of state control variables in our model allows for operations status updates in the Blockchain that in turn, feeds automated information feedbacks, disruption detection and control of contract execution. The latter launches the re-scheduling procedure, comprehensively combining planning and adaptation decisions within a unified methodological framework of dynamic control theory. The modelling complex developed can be used to design and control smart contracts in the SC.

TI Statistical arbitrage with optimal causal paths on high-frequency data
   of the S&P 500
SO QUANTITATIVE FINANCE
AB This paper develops the optimal causal path algorithm and applies it within a fully-fledged statistical arbitrage framework to minute-by-minute data of the S&P 500 constituents from 1998 to 2015. Specifically, the algorithm efficiently determines the optimal non-linear mapping and the corresponding lead-lag structure between two time series. Afterwards, this study explores the use of optimal causal paths as a means for identifying promising stock pairs and for generating buy and sell signals. For this purpose, the established trading strategy exploits information about the leading stock to predict future returns of the following stock. The value-add of the proposed framework is assessed by benchmarking it with variants relying on classic similarity measures and a buy-and-hold investment in the S&P 500 index. In the empirical back-testing study, the trading algorithm generates statistically and economically significant returns of 54.98% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 3.57 after transaction costs. Returns are well superior to the benchmark approaches and do not load on any common sources of systematic risk. The strategy outperforms in the context of cryptocurrencies even in recent times due to the fact that stock returns contain substantial information about the future bitcoin returns.

This is mainly due to its unique features including decentralization, security, reliability, and data integrity. Despite this growing interest, little is known about the current state of knowledge and practice regarding the use of blockchain technology in education. This article is a systematic review of research investigating blockchain-based educational applications. It focuses on three main themes: (1) educational applications that have been developed with blockchain technology, (2) benefits that blockchain technology could bring to education, and (3) challenges of adopting blockchain technology in education. A detailed results analysis of each theme was conducted as well as an intensive discussion based on the findings. This review also offers insight into other educational areas that could benefit from blockchain technology.

TI User perception of Bitcoin usability and security across novice users
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
AB This paper investigates users' perceptions and experiences of an anonymous digital payment system (Bitcoin) and its influence on users in terms of usability and security in comparison to other non-anonymous payment systems such as credit/debit cards. This paper identifies users' perceptual differences in terms of usability and security. Two versions of user survey are used to collect data, which reveal significant differences in users' perceptions of credit/debit cards and Bitcoin. The usability attributes of both systems examined show that respondents perceive the usability of credit/debit cards to be higher than Bitcoin. This has a great negative influence on users' security perceptions of Bitcoin. We conclude that Bitcoin, as a crypto-currency, is still in its infancy and requires user education and a new way of thinking. The study recommends developing users' mental models to deepen developers' understanding of anonymous digital payment technology and improve user centred design. We also make recommendations with respect to e-government services that may be developed relying on crypto-currencies.

TI A Scalable Blockchain Framework for Secure Transactions in IoT
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain (BC) technologies have been dominating their respective research domains for some time. IoT offers automation at the finest level in different fields, while BC provides secure transaction processing for asset exchanges. The capability of IoT devices to generate transactions prompts their integration with BC as the next logical step. The biggest challenges in this integration are the scalability of ledger and rate of transaction execution in BC. On one hand, due to their large numbers, IoT devices will generate transactions at a rate which current block chain solutions cannot handle. On the other hand, implementing BC peers onto IoT devices is impossible due to resource constraints. This prohibits direct integration of both technologies in their current state. In this paper, we propose a solution to address these challenges by using a local peer network to bridge the gap. It restricts the number of transactions which enters the global BC by implementing a scalable local ledger, without compromising on the peer validation of transactions at local and global level. The testbed evaluations show significant reduction in the block weight and ledger size on global peers. The solution also indirectly improves the transaction processing rate of all peers due to load distribution.

TI Sentiment-Induced Bubbles in the Cryptocurrency Market
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Cryptocurrencies lack clear measures of fundamental values and are often associated with speculative bubbles. This paper introduces a new way of testing for speculative bubbles based on StockTwits sentiment, which is used as the transition variable in a smooth transition autoregression. The model allows for conditional heteroskedasticity and fat tails of the conditional distribution of the error term, and volatility may depend on the constructed sentiment index. We apply the model to the CRIX index, for which several bubble periods are identified. The detected locally explosive price dynamics, given the specified bubble regime controlled by a smooth transition function, are more akin to the notion of speculative bubble that is driven by exuberant sentiment. Furthermore, we find that volatility increases as the sentiment index decreases, which is analogous to the commonly called leverage effect.

TI Blockchain-Based Secure Time Protection Scheme in IoT
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Internet of Things (IoT) has been developed rapidly to make our life easier. In many loT applications (e.g., smart homes, healthcare, etc.), all the IoT devices should be synchronized in time. However, some malicious nodes located in the IoT network can influence the time synchronization, which may interrupt the IoT system and lead to serious accidents. Therefore, it is critical and challenging to guarantee the accuracy and consistency of time during the time synchronization among all the IoT devices. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based scheme to assure the security during time synchronization in IoT. Specifically, a publicly verifiable ledger is utilized to record and broadcast time, which can minimize many attacks from external environments. The use of multiple time sources can avoid the vulnerabilities caused by the centralized generation of accurate time. Moreover, the decentralized structure of this scheme has the advantage of adapting the changes of network topology. By employing an improved practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus mechanism, time synchronization can be implemented efficiently. At last, the analysis results show that our proposed scheme can achieve the desired security with high efficiency.

The paper implements the Wavelet Power Spectrum (WPS), the Wavelet Coherency (WTC), and the Cross-Wavelet (XWT) techniques. There is a positive correlation between the related variables. However, the findings indicate that there are significant regime changes in both Bitcoin returns and the TPI during the periods of 2010-11 and 2017-18. In addition, there is a significant and negative causal relationship that runs from the TPI to the returns of Bitcoin during the related periods. Overall, the paper finds that trade policy uncertainty significantly and negatively affects the Bitcoin returns during the periods of regime changes.

SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL APPLICATIONS
AB In this study, we investigate the existence of chaos in the global cryptocurrency market. Specifically, we analyze parameters of chaotic order, nonlinearity, sensitivity to the initial conditions, monofractality, and multifractality. For this purpose, we conduct a comprehensive series of tests, including Brock-Dechert-Scheinkman (BDS) test, largest Lyapunov exponent, box-counting, and monogram analysis for fractal dimension, and multiple tests for long-range dependence (Aggregated Variances, Peng, Higuchi, R/S Analysis, and Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MFDFA)). All tests are performed over a variety of major cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, and Ripple. The empirical results support the existence of chaos in the cryptocurrency market. Accordingly, cryptocurrency returns are not random and follow a chaotic order. Therefore, long term predictions are not possible, contrary to most of the discussions ongoing in the media and the public.

An analysis of Bitcoin's P2P market indicates that when prices are measured relative to the going market rate, P2P traders in Bitcoin face different premiums and discounts depending on the currency traded, which in turn impacts on the bid-ask spread. In periods of extreme price changes such as the extraordinary price rise in Bitcoin occurring in 2017, measuring bid-ask spreads in relative terms masks the true picture of widening monetary bid-ask spreads.

TI Local Electricity Storage for Blockchain-Based Energy Trading in
   Industrial Internet of Things
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB The peer-to-peer energy trading has been achieved among nodes in industrial Internet of Things. To establish a secure private market, some meaningful works propose the concept of the energy chain, where one block is added in a linear and chronological order once the trading pair of nodes (buyer and seller) has a valid transaction verified by data audit (e.g., a hash value). Since the buyer applies virtual coins from the credit bank to buy others' surplus energy, a considerable credit utility is obtained if all nodes are encouraged to meet local power loads out of self-interest. However, such frequent transactions have huge operational overhead, including a long chain maintaining many blocks and an expensive energy transportation cost between trading pairs. To solve these challenging issues, our method enables nodes to satisfy their power loads through local stored energy (self-sufficiency), before participating as sellers if they still have considerable surplus electricity. Without transactions made by some self-sufficient nodes, the operational overhead can be mitigated in a more secure environment. Taking the classic Internet of energy as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions, and it can achieve a good tradeoff between credit utility and operational overhead.

SO FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Through the application of three pair-wise bivariate BEKK models, this paper examines the conditional volatility dynamics along with interlinkages and conditional correlations between three pairs of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin-Ether, Bitcoin-Litecoin, and Ether-Litecoin. While cryptocurrency price volatility is found to be dependent on its own past shocks and past volatility, we find evidence of bi-directional shock transmission effects between Bitcoin and both Ether and Litecoin, and uni-directional shock spillovers from Ether to Litecoin. Finally, we identify bi-directional volatility spillover effects between all the three pairs and provide evidence that time-varying conditional correlations exist and are mostly positive.

TI Momentum and contrarian effects on the cryptocurrency market
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We report the results of investigation of the momentum and contrarian effects on cryptocurrency markets. The investigated investment strategies involve 100 (amongst over 1200 present as of date Nov 2017) cryptocurrencies with the largest market cap and average 14-day daily volume exceeding a given threshold value. Investment portfolios are constructed using different assumptions regarding the portfolio reallocation period, width of the ranking window, the number of cryptocurrencies in the portfolio, and the percent transaction costs. The performance is benchmarked against: (1) equally weighted and (2) market-cap weighted investments in all of the ranked assets, as well as against the buy and hold strategies based on (3) S&P500 index, and (4) Bitcoin price. Our results show a clear and significant dominance of the short-term contrarian effect over both momentum effect and the benchmark portfolios. The information ratio coefficient for the contrarian strategies often exceeds two-digit values depending on the assumed reallocation period and the width of the ranking window. Additionally, we observe a significant diversification potential for all cryptocurrency portfolios with relation to the S&P500 index. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Time Series Classification of Cryptocurrency Price Trend Based on a
   Recurrent LSTM Neural Network
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB In this study, we applied the long short-term memory (LSTM) model to classify the cryptocurrency price time series. We collected historic cryptocurrency price time series data and preprocessed them in order to make them clean for use as train and target data. After such preprocessing, the price time series data were systematically encoded into the three-dimensional price tensor representing the past price changes of cryptocurrencies. We also presented our LSTM model structure as well as how to use such price tensor as input data of the LSTM model. In particular, a grid search-based k-fold cross-validation technique was applied to find the most suitable LSTM model parameters. Lastly, through the comparison of the f1-score values, our study showed that the LSTM model outperforms the gradient boosting model, a general machine learning model known to have relatively good prediction performance, for the time series classification of the cryptocurrency price trend. With the LSTM model, we got a performance improvement of about 7% compared to using the GB model.

TI NormaChain: A Blockchain-Based Normalized Autonomous Transaction
   Settlement System for IoT-Based E-Commerce
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Internet of Things (IoT)-based E-commerce is a new business model that relies on autonomous transaction management on IoT-devices. The management system toward loT-based E-commerce demands autonomy, lightweight, and legitimacy. As blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, we adopt it to design the autonomous transaction management system on IoT E-commerce. However, current blockchain solutions, most namely cryptocurrencies, have fatal drawbacks of nonsupervisability and huge computational overhead, and hence cannot be directly applied on IoT-based E-commerce. In this paper, we propose NormaChain, a blockchain-based normalized autonomous transaction settlement system for IoT-based E-commerce. By designing a special three-layer sharding blockchain network, we can significantly increase transaction efficiency and system scalability. Additionally, by designing an innovative decentralized public key searchable encryption scheme (decentralized public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) scheme), we can uncover illegal and criminal transactions and achieve crime traceability. Our new decentralized PEKS scheme cryptographically eliminates the dependence of a trusted central authority in the original PEKS scheme and instead expands it to a fully decentralized governance, which distributes the supervision power equally among all parties. More importantly, by proving NormaChain is secure against chosen ciphertext attacks and against the stealing of the secret key, we show that NormaChain prevents a legitimate user's privacy from being violated by banks, supervisors or malicious adversaries. Finally, we deliver the NormaChain system with design details and full implementations. Experiments show that the average transaction-per-second on IoT devices is around 113, and the supervision accuracy is 100% when proper target illegal keywords are provided.

TI Anonymous Reputation System for IIoT-Enabled Retail Marketing Atop PoS
   Blockchain
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is revolutionizing the retail industry for manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers to improve operational efficiency and consumer experience. In IIoT-enabled retail marketing, reputation systems play a critical role to boost mutual trust among industrial entities and build consumer confidence. In this paper, we focus on reputation management in the consumer-retailer channel, where retailers can accumulate reputations from consumer feedbacks. To encourage consumers to post feedbacks without worrying about being tracked or retaliated, we propose an anonymous reputation system that preserves consumer identities and individual review confidentialities. To increase system transparency and reliability, we further exploit the tamper-proof nature and the distributed consensus mechanism of the blockchain technology. With system designs based on various cryptographic primitives and a Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, our blockchain-based reputation system is more efficient to offer high levels of privacy guarantees compared with existing ones. Finally, we explore the implementation challenges of the blockchain-based architecture and present a proof-of-concept prototype system by Parity Ethereum. We measure the on/off-chain performance with the scalability discussion to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system.

TI Blockchain Inspired RFID-Based Information Architecture for Food Supply

SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB In this paper, we propose a blockchain inspired Internet-of-Things architecture for creating a transparent food supply chain. The architecture uses a proof-of-object-based authentication protocol, which is analogous to the cryptocurrency's proof-of-work protocol. The complete architecture was realized by integrating a radio frequency identification (RFID)-based sensor at the physical layer and blockchain at the cyber layer. The RFID provides a unique identity of the product and the sensor data, which helps in real time quality monitoring. For this purpose, a small feature size 900-MHz RFID coupled sensor was fabricated and demonstrated for real time sensor data acquisition. The blockchain architecture aids in creating a tamper-proof digital database of the food packages at each instance. A detailed security analysis was performed to investigate the vulnerability of the proposed architecture under different types of cyber attacks.

Despite the fact that there are already a variety of secure management frameworks for IoT, they are based on centralized models, which limits their applicability in scenarios with a large number of IoT devices. In order to overcome those limitations, we have developed a distributed IoT management system based on blockchain. In this paper, we compare the performance of our solution with the existing access management solutions in IoT. We study the delays and the throughput rate associated with the systems and analyze different configurations of our solution to maximize its scalability. The objective of this paper is to find out whether our solution can scale as well as the existing management systems in IoT.

TI Blockchain-Based Software-Defined Industrial Internet of Things: A
   Dueling Deep Q-Learning Approach
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB With the developments of communication technologies and smart manufacturing, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has emerged. Software-defined networking (SDN), a promising paradigm shift, has provided a viable way to manage HoT dynamically, called software-defined IIoT (sDito r). In SDIIoT, lots of data and flows are generated by industrial devices, where a physically distributed but logically centralized control plane is necessary. However, one of the most intractable problems is how to reach consensus among multiple controllers under complex industrial environments. In this paper, we propose a blockchain (BC)-based consensus protocol in SDIIoT, along with detailed consensus steps and theoretical analysis, where BC works as a trusted third party to collect and synchronize network-wide views between different SDN controllers. Specially, it is a permissioned BC. In order to improve the throughput of this BC-based SDIIoT, we jointly consider the trust features of BC nodes and controllers, as well as the computational capability of the BC system. Accordingly, we formulate view change, access selection, and computational resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. We describe this problem as a Markov decision process by defining state space, action space, and reward function. Due to the fact that it is difficult to solve this joint problem by traditional methods, we propose a novel dueling deep Q-learning approach. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

The sample for crypto-currencies consists of Bitcoin and Ethereum, while that for real time commodity futures of Gold, Silver, Copper, Crude Oil, Brent Oil, Natural Gas and Wheat on daily basis, spanning the period February 2, 2012 to December 31, 2017. Given that the past evidence of a non-linear structure of cryptocurrencies and real time commodity futures (Shahzad et al., 2017; Shahbaz et al., 2017), the analysis uses the novel methodology of causality on quantiles, proposed by Balcilar et al. (2016), for the case of a non-linear framework. The results highlight that significant causality runs from cryptocurrencies to commodity futures both in terms of mean and in volatility in the majority of the quantiles. These results carry substantial implications for investors, including both cryptocurrencies and commodity futures alone or along with traditional equities in a portfolio.

By using VAR (Vector Autoregressive Model)-SVAR (Structural Vector Autoregressive Model) Granger causality and Student's-t Copulas, we find that Ethereum is likely to be the independent coin in this market, while Bitcoin tends to be the spillover effect recipient. Our study sheds further light on investigating the contagion risks among cryptocurrencies by employing Student's-t Copulas for joint distribution. This result suggests that all coins negatively change in terms of extreme value. The investors are advised to pay more attention to bad news' and moving patterns in order to make timely decisions on three types (buy, hold, and sell).

SO ENTROPY
AB Cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly relevant in the financial world and can be considered as an emerging market. The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models.

Allowing for both linear and nonlinear correlation and causality tests, the empirical results mainly show that: first, trading volume and return volatility are negatively correlated, implying a lack of support for the MDH; second, we document significant lead-lag relationships between trading volume and return volatility, which support the SIAH; third, the results are robust to alternative measurements of trading volume, data source and sub-period analysis. Generally speaking, these findings have practical implications for investors, who are interested in investing in Bitcoin market.

TI Smart Contract-Based Negotiation for Adaptive QoS-Aware Service
   Composition
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS
AB Smart contracts ( SCs) run on the distributed ledger technology ( DLT) platform and can implement agreements between participants without a trusted third party. This paper uses the DLT and SC techniques to build distributed applications composed of existing services. In practice, there are many functionally-equivalent services on the Internet. To beat their competitors, the service providers usually offer flexible QoS and use dynamic pricing strategies. Moreover, the service providers can change at runtime, e.g., they may encounter problems so that their QoS drops suddenly. This makes achieving the optimization goal at runtime ( e.g., the maximization of the utility) more difficult. To address this problem, first, this paper proposes an SC-based negotiation framework. The SCs can ensure that the transactions are automatically and reliably performed as agreed upon between the service requesters and providers. The DLTs can provide the reliable data of the requests and responses of the service requesters and providers to the SCs. In addition, the SCs can identify the troubled service providers, and find other service providers to replace them at runtime. Second, this paper proposes a Bayesian Nash equilibrium ( BNE) of the service providers. In the BNE, the cost-efficient service providers offer the high QoS the service requester asks for and report their costs truthfully. This BNE enables the selection of the cost-efficient service providers and the achievement of the ( near) maximization of the service requesters' utility. This paper implements the proposed negotiation framework on a DLT platform called Hyperledger Fabric. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approaches and can adapt to the changes of the service providers.

TI Building dynamic capabilities for digital transformation: An ongoing
   process of strategic renewal
SO LONG RANGE PLANNING
AB In this qualitative study, we explore how incumbent firms in traditional industries build dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Digital transformation has been defined as the use of new digital technologies, such as mobile, artificial intelligence, cloud, blockchain, and the Internet of things (IoT) technologies, to enable major business improvements to augment customer experience, streamline operations, or create new business models. In making sense of digital transformation, we discovered that leaders in various industry circles use the term inconsistently to describe various strategizing and organizing activities; in addition, the term has gained limited scholarly attention as a context for study of strategic change. Drawing on senior executives' experiences with leading digitalization projects at incumbent firms, we propose a process model comprising of nine microfoundations to reveal the generic contingency factors that trigger, enable, and hinder the building of dynamic capabilities for digital transformation. Our findings reveal that digital transformation is an ongoing process of using new digital technologies in everyday organizational life, which recognizes agility as the core mechanism for the strategic renewal of an organization's (1) business model, (2) collaborative approach, and eventually the (3) culture.

TI Are Bitcoin bubbles predictable? Combining a generalized Metcalfe's Law
   and the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity model
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB We develop a strong diagnostic for bubbles and crashes in Bitcoin, by analysing the coincidence (and its absence) of fundamental and technical indicators. Using a generalized Metcalfe's Law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) is exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of Bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways Bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).

TI Blockchain-Based Secure Distributed Control for Software Defined Optical
   Networking
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB Software defined optical networking (SDON) is a critical technology for the next generation network with the advantages of programmable control and etc. As one of the key issues of SDON, the security of control plane has also received extensive attention, especially in certain network scenarios with high security requirement. Due to the existence of vulnerabilities and heavy overhead, the existing firewalls and distributed control technologies cannot solve the control plane security problem well. In this paper, we propose a distributed control architecture for SDON using the blockchain technique (BlockCtrl). The proposed BlockCtrl model introduces the advantages of blockchain into SDON to achieve a high-efficiency fault tolerant control. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it to the existing models with respect to various metrics including processing rate, recovery latency and etc. The numerical results show that the BlockCtrl is capable of attacks detection and fault tolerant control in SDON with high performance on resource utilization and service correlation.

TI Resource Trading in Blockchain-Based Industrial Internet of Things
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Past few years have witnessed the compelling applications of the blockchain technique in our daily life ranging from the financial market to health care. Considering the integration of the blockchain technique and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain may act as a distributed ledger for beneficially establishing a decentralized autonomous trading platform for industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. However, the power and computation constraints prevent IoT devices from directly participating in this proof-of-work process. As a remedy, in this treatise, the cloud computing service is introduced into the blockchain platform for the sake of assisting to offload computational task from the IIoT network itself. In addition, we study the resource management and pricing problem between the cloud provider and miners. More explicitly, we model the interaction between the cloud provider and miners as a Stackelberg game, where the leader, i.e., cloud provider, makes the price first, and then miners act as the followers. Moreover, in order to find the Nash equilibrium of the proposed Stackelberg game, a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm is conceived for searching the near-optimal policy. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our proposed algorithm in comparison to some state-of-the-art schemes.

TI Governance and control in distributed ledgers: Understanding the
   challenges facing blockchain technology in financial services
SO INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION
AB As blockchain platforms are becoming increasingly noticeable in financial services and beyond, questions arise regarding their suitability to compete with or replace existing payment systems and marketplaces and redesign the financial infrastructures of the future. Prominent among these concerns are issues around governance and control in distributed ledgers: How are distributed ledger technologies governed? Can blockchains address complex administration problems? What key issues of note for practitioners and academics have emerged thus far? In this paper we aim to review the existing governance practices of established or popular blockchain and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) systems with a view to understanding how they hold up in times of crises. What questions are raised when they are compromised or faced consensus challenges in coordinating action especially around control and accountability? We use a translational process, generating focal insights about present concerns from the reference point of completed academic studies and extensive practitioner consultation. Rather than adopting a declarative approach attempting to provide all the answers, we draw insights from the IT platform governance literature to offer a critical perspective for asking the right questions around key governance issues in financial infrastructure such as decision rights, control mechanisms, and incentives.

TI Coin Hopping Attack in Blockchain-Based IoT
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB With dramatic developments of blockchain technology, a number of blockchain-based applications emerge rapidly, among which the incorporation of blockchain into Internet of Things is one of the most valued research direction. Such powerful incorporation is a double-sided sword, i.e., it can benefit both individuals and society but has the vulnerability to coin hopping attack that is a new type of pool mining attack and hard to happen in traditional blockchain networks. In this paper, we theoretically prove the feasibility of coin hopping attack, deeply analyze the conditions of attack implementation, and comprehensively investigate the impacts of coin hopping attack. Moreover, some defense strategies are addressed. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first work targeting coin hopping attack.

TI A Review on the Role of Blockchain Technology in the Healthcare Domain
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Recently, there have been increasing calls for healthcare providers to provide controls for patients over their personal health records. Nevertheless, security issues concerning how different healthcare providers exchange healthcare information have caused a flop in the deployment of such systems. The ability to exchange data securely is important so that new borderless integrated healthcare services can be provided to patients. Due to its decentralized nature, blockchain technology is a suitable driver for the much-needed shift towards integrated healthcare, providing new insights and addressing some of the main challenges of many healthcare areas. Blockchain allows healthcare providers to record and manage peer-to-peer transactions through a network without central authority. In this paper, we discuss the concept of blockchain technology and hurdles in their adoption in the healthcare domain. Furthermore, a review is conducted on the latest implementations of blockchain technology in healthcare. Finally, a new case study of a blockchain-based healthcare platform is presented addressing the drawbacks of current designs, followed by recommendations for future blockchain researchers and developers.

TI Securing e-voting based on blockchain in P2P network
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Electronic voting (e-voting) is an electronic means for casting and counting votes. It is an efficient and cost-effective way for conducting a voting procedure, which has characteristic of being magnanimous data and real time and requesting high safety. However, concerns on security of networking and privacy of communication for e-voting have been grown. Securing e-voting is very urgent and has becoming a popular topic in the area of communications and networking. We present techniques to exploit blockchain in P2P network to improve the security of e-voting. First, we design a synchronized model of voting records based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) to avoid forgery of votes. Second, we design a user credential model based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to provide authentication and non-repudiation. Third, we design a withdrawal model that allows voters to change their vote before a preset deadline. By integrating the above designs, a blockchain-based e-voting scheme in P2P network is proposed for essential requirements of e-voting process. To prove and verify the scheme, a blockchain-based e-voting system for multiple candidates has been designed on Linux platforms in P2P network. The system involves electronic voting theory, cryptography, and software engineering theory. The implementation result shows that it is a practical and secure e-voting system, which solves the problem on forgery of votes during e-voting. The blockchain-based e-voting system can be applied to a variety of networking applications directly.

TI Design Choices and Trade-Offs in Health Care Blockchain Implementations:
   Systematic Review
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: A blockchain is a list of records that uses cryptography to make stored data immutable; their use has recently been proposed for electronic medical record (EMR) systems. This paper details a systematic review of trade-offs in blockchain technologies that are relevant to EMRs. Trade-offs are defined as "a compromise between two desirable but incompatible features."
   Objective: This review's primary research question was: "What are the trade-offs involved in different blockchain designs that are relevant to the creation of blockchain-based electronic medical records systems?"
   Methods: Seven databases were systematically searched for relevant articles using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Papers published from January 1, 2017 to June 15, 2018 were selected. Quality assessments of papers were performed using the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool and the Critical Assessment Skills Programme (CASP) tool. Database searches identified 2885 articles, of which 15 were ultimately included for analysis.
   Results: A total of 17 trade-offs were identified impacting the design, development, and implementation of blockchain systems; these trade-offs are organized into themes, including business, application, data, and technology architecture.
   Conclusions: The key findings concluded the following: (1) multiple trade-offs can be managed adaptively to improve EMR utility; (2) multiple trade-offs involve improving the security of blockchain systems at the cost of other features, meaning EMR efficacy highly depends on data protection standards; and (3) multiple trade-offs result in improved blockchain scalability. Consideration of these trade-offs will be important to the specific environment in which electronic medical records are being developed. This review also uses its findings to suggest useful design choices for a hypothetical National Health Service blockchain.

TI Packet Key-Based End-to-End Security Management on a Blockchain Control
   Plane
SO SENSORS
AB The existing LTE mobile system uses the vertical model to handle the session-based security management. However, the goal of this paper is to propose a packet key-based security management scheme on the blockchain control plane to enhance the existing session key-based security scheme and overcome the limitation that the existing vertical model, as well as the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based horizontal model, confronts within solving end-to-end security management. The proposed blockchain-based security management (BSM) scheme enables each peer to easily obtain the necessary parameters required to manage the packet key-based security system. The important features of the BSM scheme include the renewal process, which enables the different packet data streams to use completely different security parameters for the security management. In addition, because even blind values cannot be exposed to the possible attackers, our BSM scheme guarantees very secure end-to-end data transfer against active attacks such as falsification of data and transactions. Finally, this paper compares the BSM scheme with the existing vertical model to prove the advantageous effects on latency.

TI Data Storage Mechanism Based on Blockchain with Privacy Protection in
   Wireless Body Area Network
SO SENSORS
AB Wireless body area networks (WBANs) are expected to play a vital role in the field of patient-health monitoring shortly. They provide a convenient way to collect patient data, but they also bring serious problems which are mainly reflected in the safe storage of the collected data. The privacy and security of data storage in WBAN devices cannot meet the needs of WBAN users. Therefore, this paper adopts blockchain technology to store data, which improves the security of the collected data. Moreover, a storage model based on blockchain in WBAN is proposed in our solution. However, blockchain storage brings new problems, for example, that the storage space of blockchain is small, and the stored content is open to unauthorized attackers. To solve the problems above, this paper proposed a sequential aggregate signature scheme with a designated verifier (DVSSA) to ensure that the user's data can only be viewed by the designated person and to protect the privacy of the users of WBAN. In addition, the new signature scheme can also compress the size of the blockchain storage space.

TI Trusted Transactions in Micro-Grid Based on Blockchain
SO ENERGIES
AB In order to build a local electricity market (LEM), community members can trade electricity peer-to-peer (P2P) with their neighbors. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Bidding and Transaction Structure based on blockchain (HBTS). First, combined with the multi-agents, each microgrid corrects the estimated cost probability distribution of other microgrids by Bayesian theorem, making its probability closer to the accurate probability. Second, for maximize the benefits of the microgrid, this paper uses the Nash equilibrium in the Cournot model to find the optimal quotation and output of different bidding strategies for the microgrid under different power demand conditions. Then the exchange of electricity translates into an exchange of digital proof of electricity purchases and sales of electricity on the Hyperledger Fabric, ensuring the security of the transaction process and the irreparable modification of ledgers. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the bidding strategy through experiments, and analyze the transaction process.

TI Enhancing IoT Data Dependability through a Blockchain Mirror Model
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a remarkable data producer and these data may be used to prevent or detect security vulnerabilities and increase productivity by the adoption of statistical and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. However, these desirable benefits are gained if data from IoT networks are dependablethis is where blockchain comes into play. In fact, through blockchain, critical IoT data may be trusted, i.e., considered valid for any subsequent processing. A simple formal model named the Mirror Model is proposed to connect IoT data organized in traditional models to assets of trust in a blockchain. The Mirror Model sets some formal conditions to produce trusted data that remain trusted over time. A possible practical implementation of an application programming interface (API) is proposed, which keeps the data and the trust model in synch. Finally, it is noted that the Mirror Model enforces a top-down approach from reality to implementation instead of going the opposite way as it is now the practice when referring to blockchain and the IoT.

TI Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know: On the predictability of
   cryptocurrencies by means of Google search volume
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB We evaluate the usefulness of Google search volume to predict returns and volatility of multiple cryptocurrencies. The analysis is based on a new algorithm which allows to construct multi-annual, consistent time series of Google search volume indices (SVIs) on various frequencies. As cryptocurrencies are actively traded on a continuous basis and react very fast to new information, we conduct the analysis initially on a daily basis, lifting the data imposed restriction faced by previous research. In line with the literature on financial markets, we find that returns are not predictable while volatility is predictable to some extent. We discuss a number of reasons why the predictive power is poor. One aspect is the observational frequency which is therefore varied. The results of unpredictable cryptocurrency returns hold on higher (hourly) and lower (weekly) frequencies. Volatility, in contrast, is predictable on all frequencies and we document an increasing accuracy of the forecast when the sampling frequency is lowered.

TI S-money: virtual tokens for a relativistic economy
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING
   SCIENCES
AB We propose definitions and implementations of 'S-money'-virtual tokens designed for high-value fast transactions on networks with relativistic or other trusted signalling constraints, defined by inputs that in general are made at many network points, some or all of which may be space-like separated. We argue that one significant way of characterizing types of money in space-time is via the 'summoning' tasks they can solve: that is, how flexibly the money can be propagated to a desired space-time point in response to relevant information received at various space-time points. We show that S-money is more flexible than standard quantum or classical money in the sense that it can solve deterministic summoning tasks that they cannot. It requires the issuer and user to have networks of agents with classical data storage and communication, but no long-term quantum state storage, and is feasible with current technology. User privacy can be incorporated by secure bit commitment and zero-knowledge proof protocols. The level of privacy feasible in given scenarios depends on efficiency and composable security questions that remain to be systematically addressed.

TI Fair compute loads enabled by blockchain: sharing models by alternating
   client and server roles
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB Objective: Decentralized privacy-preserving predictive modeling enables multiple institutions to learn a more generalizable model on healthcare or genomic data by sharing the partially trained models instead of patient-level data, while avoiding risks such as single point of control. State-of-the-art blockchain-based methods remove the server role but can be less accurate than models that rely on a server. Therefore, we aim at developing a general model sharing framework to preserve predictive correctness, mitigate the risks of a centralized architecture, and compute the models in a fair way. Materials and Methods: We propose a framework that includes both server and client roles to preserve correctness. We adopt a blockchain network to obtain the benefits of decentralization, by alternating the roles for each site to ensure computational fairness. Also, we developed GloreChain (Grid Binary LOgistic REgression on Permissioned BlockChain) as a concrete example, and compared it to a centralized algorithm on 3 healthcare or genomic datasets to evaluate predictive correctness, number of learning iterations and execution time. Results: GloreChain performs exactly the same as the centralized method in terms of correctness and number of iterations. It inherits the advantages of blockchain, at the cost of increased time to reach a consensus model. Discussion: Our framework is general or flexible and can also address intrinsic challenges of blockchain networks. Further investigations will focus on higher-dimensional datasets, additional use cases, privacy-preserving quality concerns, and ethical, legal, and social implications. Conclusions: Our framework provides a promising potential for institutions to learn a predictive model based on healthcare or genomic data in a privacy-preserving and decentralized way.

TI Preliminary findings on cryptocurrency trading among regular gamblers: A
   new risk for problem gambling?
SO ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS
AB Cryptocurrencies are emerging digital currencies that allow anonymity in accessing various risk-taking activities through the Internet (e.g., drugs, gambling). However, given conceptual links to high-risk stocks, the present study sought to assess the association between trading cryptocurrencies and problem gambling. Data was collected through a cross-sectional online survey. Advertisement for the survey was posted on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Participants were adults who had gambled at least monthly in the past year (N = 876; 58.33% male; M = 33.74 years, SD = 9.73). Participants completed the Problem Gambling Severity Index, Patient Health Questionnaire (2-item version), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (2-item version). Trading cryptocurrencies is strongly associated with problem gambling severity (r = 0.53, p <.001). Results from a linear regression with backwards elimination revealed that sports betting, daily fantasy sports, high-risk stock trading, and problem gambling severity contribute to trading cryptocurrencies more frequently in the past year, whereas gambling in on-land casinos contributed to less cryptocurrency trading. Finally, trading cryptocurrencies overlapped strongly with trading high-risk stocks. Moreover, gamblers who engaged in both forms of trading reported greater problem gambling and depression and anxiety symptoms relative to those trading either cryptocurrencies or high-risk stocks, but not both. The present results suggest that trading cryptocurrencies may be appealing to gamblers that are exhibiting greater problem gambling severity. Future research should begin to include cryptocurrency trading in screening, assessment, and treatment protocols, particularly with regular gamblers.

Due to the recent increase in forgeries and loss of records, it is paramount that this process becomes more transparent and reliable for all involved parties. This article presents a proposal and an implementation for the digitization of degree certificates and academic credits for higher education in the Brazilian education system. A transparent model based on blockchain is proposed, in which higher education institutions register students and their academic credits in a chain of records using the Brazilian Public Key Infrastructure for identity management. This information, associated with smart contracts, enables the reliable and decentralized issuance of degree certificates through the validation of a historical database and the triggering of transactions using smart contracts. The focus of this article is the demonstration of an experiment that validates this proposal.

TI Assessing Blockchain Consensus and Security Mechanisms against the 51%
   Attack
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The 51% attack is a technique which intends to fork a blockchain in order to conduct double-spending. Adversaries controlling more than half of the total hashing power of a network can perform this attack. In a similar way, n confirmation and selfish mining are two attack techniques that comprise a similar strategy to the 51% attack. Due to the immense attacking cost to perform the 51% attack, it was considered very unlikely for a long period. However, in recent times, the attack has befallen at a frequent pace, costing millions of dollars to various cryptocurrencies. The 51% attack strategy varies based upon the adopted consensus mechanism by a particular cryptocurrency, and it enables attackers to double-spend the same crypto-coin, restrict transactions, cancel blocks, and even have full control over the price of a cryptocurrency. A crypto-coin with a low hashing power is always jeopardized by the 51% attack due to the easily attainable hashing. In this paper, we analyze the real impact of the 51% attack, revealing serious weaknesses in consensus protocols that made this attack possible. We discuss the five most advanced protection techniques to prevent this attack and their main limitations. We conclude that in most cases, security techniques fail to provide real protection against the 51% attack because the weaknesses are inherited from the consensus protocols.

TI FREE MONEY, BUT NOT TAX-FREE: A PROPOSAL FOR THE TAX TREATMENT OF
   CRYPTOCURRENCY HARD FORKS
SO FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
AB Cryptocurrency has attracted extraordinary attention as one of the greatest financial innovations in recent years. Equally noticeable are the increasingly frequent cryptocurrency events, such as hard forks. Put simply, a cryptocurrency hard fork happens when a single cryptocurrency splits in two, which results in original coin owners receiving free forked coins. Such hard forks have resulted in billions of dollars distributed to U.S. taxpayers. Despite ongoing regulatory efforts, to date, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has yet to take a clear position on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency hard forks. The lack of useful guidance when filing tax returns has left taxpayers genuinely confused in the past few years.
   To fill this regulatory gap, this Note proposes a framework for cryptocurrency hard fork taxation. It explains the underlying technology of cryptocurrency hard forks, examines the recommended guidelines from the American Bar Association and the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants on cryptocurrency hard fork taxation, and references the current practices in Japan and the United Kingdom to lay a solid foundation for the proposed framework. Ultimately, this Note proposes a two-pronged tax on cryptocurrency hard forks. The first tax is levied on the profit made from the receipt of forked coins, and the second tax is levied on the profit made from the disposition of forked coins. A concrete proposal is provided for the applicable coin valuation, tax basis, holding period, and tax rate for the two prongs.
   Aiming to propose a tax treatment that is closest to the nature of cryptocurrency hard forks, this proposal considers various practical concerns, such as the inefficiency of the cryptocurrency market, the indirect possession of forked coins through third-party exchanges, and the fluctuating trading prices of forked coins when determining the valuation, tax basis, and holding period. This proposal not only provides clarity for taxpayers in filing tax returns and fulfilling tax obligations, but it also relieves the potential tax deferral and tax evasion problems that arise after a cryptocurrency hard fork.

TI Applying Technologies of Distributed Registries and Blockchains in
   Popular Voting and Lawmaking: Key Methods and Main Problems
SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
AB Being a driving force behind the development of various social relations, the intensification of modern technologies forms new conditions for modernizing democratic institutions. Different innovations in the field of digital communications affect mechanisms for the realization of political rights and freedoms of a person and citizen, transform activities of public authorities and tools of their interaction with civil society institutions. In these conditions, innovations influence even traditional areas, including popular voting and lawmaking. The active introduction of distributed registry technologies affected the development of new methodological approaches and reformed the organization of elections. This technology has widespread use due to blockchain technology. Although it was initially considered as an element of development in the information and financial spheres, now blockchain is gradually entering other spheres of human activity, including political, due to the high degree of security and confidentiality. This paper analyzes the global practice of using this technology in popular voting and legislative procedures. The authors of the article consider technical solutions applied in the most rapidly growing projects aimed to develop their own software for conducting electronic election powered by a blockchain technology. Special attention is paid to the legal security of voting by secret ballot and the identification of voters in the conditions of applying these technologies.

SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB We compare Bitcoin performance based on the Aumann and Serrano performance index and Sharpe ratio assuming that asset returns follow the class of discrete normal mixture distributions. The Aumann and Serrano performance index can take into account higher moments of the underlying distribution of assets and is relevant for risk-averse investors. We evaluate Bitcoin performance based on the Aumann and Serrano index relative to the performance of other assets. Our evaluation shows that Bitcoin is rated highly by the Sharpe ratio but rated very poorly by the Aumann and Serrano index. We also find some stock assets can beat Bitcoin by the Sharpe ratio when an investment horizon is monthly.

TI At the Nexus of Blockchain Technology, the Circular Economy, and Product
   Deletion
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The circular economy (CE) is an emergent concept to rethink and redesign how our economy works. The concept recognizes effective and efficient economic functioning at multiple scalesgovernments and individuals, globally and locally; for businesses, large and small. CE represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience at multiple levels (macro, meso and micro); generating new business and economic opportunities while providing environmental and societal benefits. Blockchain, an emergent and critical technology, is introduced to the circular economy environment as a potential enabler for many circular economic principles. Blockchain technology supported information systems can improve circular economy performance at multiple levels. Product deletion, a neglected but critical effort in product management and product portfolio management, is utilized as an illustrative business scenario as to blockchain's application in a circular economy research context. Product deletion, unlike product proliferation, has received minimal attention from both academics and practitioners. Product deletion decisions need to be evaluated and analyzed in the circular economy context. CE helps address risk aversion issues in product deletions such as inventory, waste and information management. This paper is the first to conceptualize the relationships amongst blockchain technology, product deletion and the circular economy. Many nuances of relationships are introduced in this study. Future evaluation and critical reflections are also presented with a need for a rigorous and robust research agenda to evaluate the multiple and complex relationships and interplay amongst technology, policy, commerce and the natural environment.

TI When Energy Trading Meets Blockchain in Electrical Power System: The
   State of the Art
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB With the rapid growth of renewable energy resources, energy trading has been shifting from the centralized manner to distributed manner. Blockchain, as a distributed public ledger technology, has been widely adopted in the design of new energy trading schemes. However, there are many challenging issues in blockchain-based energy trading, e.g., low efficiency, high transaction cost, and security and privacy issues. To tackle these challenges, many solutions have been proposed. In this survey, the blockchain-based energy trading in the electrical power system is thoroughly investigated. Firstly, the challenges in blockchain-based energy trading are identified and summarized. Then, the existing energy trading schemes are studied and classified into three categories based on their main focuses: energy transaction, consensus mechanism, and system optimization. Blockchain-based energy trading has been a popular research topic, new blockchain architectures, models and products are continually emerging to overcome the limitations of existing solutions, forming a virtuous circle. The internal combination of different blockchain types and the combination of blockchain with other technologies improve the blockchain-based energy trading system to better satisfy the practical requirements of modern power systems. However, there are still some problems to be solved, for example, the lack of regulatory system, environmental challenges and so on. In the future, we will strive for a better optimized structure and establish a comprehensive security assessment model for blockchain-based energy trading system.

TI Storytelling about places: Tourism marketing in the digital age
SO CITIES
AB Storytelling about places is recognized as a tool to enhance the reputation of regions as they compete for tourism and economic development spending in the digital age. Through digital media, people can be encouraged to tell their tourism stories and share their experiences.
   Our design approach integrates Service Science, Management, Engineering, plus Design, Arts and Public Policy (SSME + DAPP, so just SS) and Viable Systems Approach (VSA) perspectives. Storytelling can be managed in a local service system to enhance brand competitiveness. The way local governments and cultural organizations understand and encourage storytelling about places ("place storytelling") can have a significant impact on the success of a region competing for tourism and development spending. Place storytelling enables local stakeholders to tell their personal stories about their beloved places.
   Our analysis and cases demonstrate that place storytelling enables strategic communication that supports sustainable competitive advantage. By means of an analysis of "Umbria on the Blog", which is an innovative project which joins place and web 2.0, and "Il Mangiastorie", which promotes wine and food and tourism of some Campania internal area, we highlight the relevance of managing place storytelling as a strategic communication involving stakeholders in the place-identity-building process.
   This paper presents a model of place storytelling that local governments and cultural organizations can use to encourage and manage stakeholder engagement in a multilevel process for improving regional service system marketing and communications in the digital age.

TI Modelling volatility of cryptocurrencies using Markov-Switching GARCH
   models
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB This paper aims to select the best model or set of models for modelling volatility of the four most popular cryptocurrencies, i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin. More than 1000 GARCH models are fitted to the log returns of the exchange rates of each of these cryptocurrencies to estimate a one-step ahead prediction of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) on a rolling window basis. The best model or superior set of models is then chosen by backtesting VaR and ES as well as using a Model Confidence Set (MCS) procedure for their loss functions. The results imply that using standard GARCH models may yield incorrect VaR and ES predictions, and hence result in ineffective risk-management, portfolio optimisation, pricing of derivative securities etc. These could be improved by using instead the model specifications allowing for asymmetries and regime switching suggested by our analysis, from which both investors and regulators can benefit.

TI Delay and Communication Tradeoffs for Blockchain Systems With
   Lightweight IoT Clients
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The emerging blockchain protocols provide a decentralized architecture that is suitable of supporting Internet of Things (IoT) interactions. However, keeping a local copy of the blockchain ledger is infeasible for low-power and memory-constrained devices. For this reason, they are equipped with lightweight software implementations that only download the useful data structures, e.g., state of accounts, from the blockchain network, when they are updated. In this paper, we consider and analyze a novel scheme, implemented by the nodes of the blockchain network, which aggregates the blockchain data in periodic updates and further reduces the communication cost of the connected IoT devices. We show that the aggregation period should be selected based on the channel quality, the offered rate, and the statistics of updates of the useful data structures. The results, obtained for the Ethereum protocol, illustrate the benefits of the aggregation scheme in terms of a reduced duty cycle of the device, particularly for low signal-to-noise ratios, and the overall reduction of the amount of information transmitted in downlink from the wireless base station to the IoT device. A potential application of the proposed scheme is to let the IoT device request more information than actually needed, hence increasing its privacy, while keeping the communication cost constant. In the conclusion, this paper is the first to provide rigorous guidelines for the design of lightweight blockchain protocols with wireless connectivity.

TI Energy consumption boomtowns in the United States: Community responses
   to a cryptocurrency boom
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB While scholars have studied the impacts of energy development booms on local communities in the U.S., much less is known about towns experiencing energy consumption booms from industries such as cryptocurrency mining. This article proposes that energy consumption boomtowns are unique in the risks, benefits, and conflicts they create-and that they provide fruitful areas of research for energy social scientists. We illustrate this point with a brief case study of Chelan County, Washington-where an influx of crypto mining over the past five years has stirred community debate. We collected more than 100 newspaper articles, public comments, and public meeting recordings to identify the cautions, hesitations, and criticisms that have caused local regulators to take a precautionary approach. We highlight five key points of the debate that may be of interest to energy social scientists: (1) impacts on the local energy supply and prices, (2) unclear socioeconomic benefits to the county, (3) the illegitimacy of cryptocurrency, (4) environmental considerations, and (5) a disconnect with local legacy industries and community economic identity. We conclude by proposing areas of future social science research on energy consumption booms.

SO ELECTRONICS
AB Recent advancements in information and communication technology is enabling a significant revolution in e-Health research and industry. In the case of personal medical data sharing, data security and convenience are crucial requirements to the interaction and collaboration of electronic medical record (EMR) systems. However, it's hard for current systems to meet these requirements as they have inconsistent structures in terms of security policies and access control models. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data-accessing while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security to ensure the accountability of the medical usage data. Blockchain seems to pave the way for revolution in the conventional healthcare industry benefiting by its unique features such as data privacy and transparency. In this paper, a blockchain-based medical platform using a smart contract is proposed to secure the EMR management. This approach provides patients a comprehensive, immutable log and easy access to their medical information across different departments within the hospital. A case study for hospital is built on a permissioned network, and a series of experimental tests are performed to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Lastly, a benchmark study by leveraging various performance metrics is made and the outcomes indicate that the designed platform surpasses the ability of existing works in various aspects. The results of this work reveal that the proposed solution has the great potential to accelerate the development of a decentralized digital healthcare ecosystem.

TI Distributed Consensus Algorithm for Events Detection in Cyber-Physical
   Systems
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB In the harsh environmental conditions of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), the consensus problem seems to be one of the central topics that affect the performance of consensus-based applications, such as events detection, estimation, tracking, blockchain, etc. In this paper, we investigate the events detection based on consensus problem of CPS by means of compressed sensing (CS) for applications such as attack detection, industrial process monitoring, automatic alert system, and prediction for potentially dangerous events in CPS. The edge devices in a CPS are able to calculate a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) from local observation for one or more events via a consensus approach to iteratively optimize the consensus LLRs for the whole CPS system. The information-exchange topologies are considered as a collection of jointly connected networks and an iterative distributed consensus algorithm is proposed to optimize the LLRs to form a global optimal decision. Each active device in the CPS first detects the local region and obtains a local LLR, which then exchanges with its active neighbors. Compressed data collection is enforced by a reliable cluster partitioning scheme, which conserves sensing energy and prolongs network lifetime. Then the LLR estimations are improved iteratively until a global optimum is reached. The proposed distributed consensus algorithm can converge fast and hence improve the reliability with lower transmission burden and computation costs in CPS. Simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI Personality assessment of intellectually gifted adults: A dimensional
   trait approach
SO PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB Personality is often assessed by measuring the severity of dimensional traits regardless of intellectual functioning. However, extreme deviations from average cognitive abilities affect biological, psychological, and social characteristics, to the extent that they may lead to atypical trajectories of development. The present study examined subclinical personality traits of intellectually gifted adults who unlikely fulfill traditional criteria for psychopathological diagnosis.
   Seventy-five intellectually gifted individuals (i.e., at least one WAIS-IV Index >130) completed the DAPP-BQ. Their scores were compared to a control group. Age range was the same across the two groups (18-45 years). Gender differences were then examined within the gifted group.
   The group of gifted individuals reported significant higher scores on eight DAPP-BQ scales. A large effect size was found on Rejection trait; medium effect sizes on Narcissism and Low Affiliation traits. Identity Problems, Callousness, Restricted Expression, Compulsivity, and Suspiciousness were associated with small effect sizes. Moreover, gifted women reported higher scores than gifted men.
   Dysfunctional traits of gifted adults may contribute to interpersonal maladjustments. This may be the consequence of poor emotional attunement and inappropriate support that they received in childhood for their superior intellectual abilities. Sociocultural issues may maintain these psychological vulnerabilities, especially within gifted women.

TI Glycopolycation-DNA Polyplex Formulation N/P Ratio Affects Stability,
   Hemocompatibility, and in Vivo Biodistribution
SO BIOMACROMOLECULES
AB Genome editing therapies hold great promise for the cure of monogenic and other diseases; however, the application of nonviral gene delivery methods is limited by both a lack of fundamental knowledge of interactions of the gene-carrier in complex animals and biocompatibility. Herein, we characterize nonviral gene delivery vehicle formulations that are based on diblock polycations containing a hydrophilic and neutral glucose block chain extended with cationic secondary amines of three lengths, poly(methacrylamido glucopyranose-block-2-methylaminoethyl methacrylate) [P(MAG-b-MAEMt)-1, -2, -3]. These polymers were formulated with plasmid DNA to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes (polyplexes). In addition, two controls, P(EG-b-MAEMt) and P(MAEMt), were synthesized, formulated into polyplexes and the ex vivo hemocompatibility, or blood compatibility, and in vivo biodistribution of the formulations were compared to the glycopolymers. While both polymer structure and N/P (amine to phosphate) ratio were important factors affecting hemocompatibility, N/P ratio played a stronger role in determining polyplex biodistribution. P(EG-b-MAEMt) and P(MAEMt) lysed red blood cells at both high and low N/P formulations while P(MAG-b-MAEMt) did not significantly lyse cells at either formulation at short and medium polymer lengths. Conversely, P(MAG-b-MAEMt) did not affect coagulation at N/P = 5, but significantly delayed coagulation at N/P = 15. P(EG-b-MAEMt) and P(MAEMt) did not affect coagulation at either formulation. After polymer and pDNA cargo distribution was observed in vivo, P(EG-b-MAEMt) N/P = 5 and P(MAG-b-MAEMt) N/P = S both dissociated and deposited polymer in the liver, while pDNA cargo from P(MAG-b-MAEMt) N/P = 15 was found in the liver, lungs, and spleen. The contrast between P(MAG-bMAEMt) at N/P = 5 and 15 demonstrates that polyplex stability in the blood can be improved with N/P ratio and potentially aid polyplex biodistribution through simply varying the formulation ratios.

TI Portfolio management with cryptocurrencies: The role of estimation risk
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper contributes to the literature on cryptocurrencies, portfolio management and estimation risk by comparing the performance of naive diversification, Markowitz diversification and the advanced Black-Litterman model with VBCs that controls for estimation errors in a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. We show that the advanced Black-Litterman model with VBCs yields superior out-of-sample risk-adjusted returns as well as lower risks. Our results are robust to the inclusion of transaction costs and short-selling, indicating that sophisticated portfolio techniques that control for estimation errors are preferred when managing cryptocurrency portfolios.

TI Improving the predictability of stock returns with Bitcoin prices
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB This paper examines the role of Bitcoin prices (BTC hereafter) in stock return predictability of G7 countries. For completeness, the existing predictive models for stock returns that account for both country-specific and common factors are singly and jointly compared with BTC-based predictive model. The analyses are conducted for both in- and out-of-sample forecasts with multiple forecast horizons. The following results are evident in the paper. First, the paper fords evidence in favour of BTC in terms of individual in-sample forecast performance albeit the reverse for interest rate. However, the common factors appear to compete fairly with Bitcoin as the former consistently outperform the latter in three countries. Second, in terms of forecast combination, the stock returns of the G7 countries are better predicted by BTC-based model than their respective macroeconomic variables combined except for Japan. Third, while the out-of-sample forecast results for short forecast horizon reflect those obtained for the in-sample period; the performance however seems to diminish over longer forecast horizon. This is underscored by the fact that investors in the Bitcoin market often speculate over short periods due to the market tendency for higher volatility (risk). Fourth, we also test whether accounting for structural breaks matters in the BTC-based predictive model and the results largely suggest otherwise except for the out-of sample forecast of USA. Overall, the predictive power of Bitcoin can be exploited when modelling stock returns particularly over the period coinciding with high volumes of Bitcoin transactions.

TI Digitalization and Corporate Law - A View from Germany
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
AB Digitalization revolutionizes all legal areas, including corporate law. The article deals with different impacts of digitalization on communication schemes in corporations, such as virtual general assemblies or communication patterns in board of directors, also encompassing communication with third parties, namely investors. The legal framework for these communication patterns refer not only to corporate but also to media regulations, data protections, as well as capital market law. Digitalization also has an impact on liability of directors: As Big Data and new algorithms improve the information base for decision making of directors they are at the same time obliged to make use of it. On the other hand, IT-security has become one of the main tasks for directors as digitalization of all work flows in enterprises requires necessary IT-security standards in order to avoid existential risks in case of attacks. Furthermore, Blockchain as a new technology enables the secure identification of all kind of transactions, including automatized contracts (so-called smart contracts) which could enhance procedures in corporations. New problems arise concerning the use of Blockchain as an investment form such as DAO Ethereum. Finally, the phenomenon of close cooperation between different partners by using digital work flows and semi-intelligent agents (so-called industry 4.0) is discussed.

AB Cryptocurrencies have recently attracted numerous interests from investors as potential investable assets. However, research on their responses to macroeconomic policies remains insufficient. This study examines the asymmetric impacts of monetary policies on cryptocurrency returns during monetary tightening versus monetary easing regimes. Interestingly, we find significant responses of four major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin to Chinese tightening monetary policies; however, U.S. monetary policies do not significantly affect cryptocurrency returns.

TI Statistical analysis of bitcoin during explosive behavior periods
SO PLOS ONE
AB This paper develops the ability of the normal inverse Gaussian distribution (NIG) to fit the returns of bitcoin (BTC). As the first cryptocurrency created, the behavior of this new asset is characterized by great volatility. The lack of a proper definition or classification under existing theory exacerbates this property in such a way that explosive periods followed by a rapid decline have been observed along the series, meaning bubble episodes. By detecting the periods in which a bubble rises and collapses, it is possible to study the statistical properties of such segments. In particular, adjusting a theoretical distribution may help to determine better strategies to hedge against these episodes. The NIG is an appropriate candidate not only because of its heavy-tailed property but also because it has been proven to be closed under convolution, a characteristic that can be implemented to measure multivariate value at risk. Using data on the price of BTC with respect to seven of the main global currencies, the NIG was able to fit every time segment despite the bubble behavior. In the out-of-sample tests, the NIG was proven to have an adjustment similar to that of a generalized hyperbolic (GH) distribution. This result could serve as a starting point for future studies regarding the statistical properties of cryptocurrencies as well as their multivariate distributions.

TI Can Bitcoin be a diversifier, hedge or safe haven tool?
SO COGENT ECONOMICS & FINANCE
AB This paper investigates whether Bitcoin acts as a diversifier, hedge or safe haven tool for investors in major developed and developing markets, as well as for commodities. This paper employs the GARCH Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) model. The sample covers seven developed and six developing countries, five regional indices and 10 commodity series. The results show that Bitcoin acts as a hedge for investors in most of the developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and South Korea, but only as a diversifier for investors in developed countries and for commodities. Moreover, Bitcoin acts as a diversifier for all the 10 commodities studied here. During the US election in 2016, Brexit referendum in 2016, and the burst of Chinese market bubble in 2015, Bitcoin acted as a safe haven asset for both the US and non-US investors. Understanding the role of Bitcoin is important for financial market participants who seek protection against market turmoil and downward movements. Furthermore, our findings would be of interests to regulators and governments to engage in more discussion of the role of Bitcoin in financial markets. This paper contributes to the ongoing debate on the usefulness of Bitcoin for investments. Furthermore, it distinguishes the benefits of Bitcoin as a diversifier, hedge and safe haven to investors in the developed versus developing markets.

TI Is Bitcoin the Only Problem? A Scenario Model for the Power Demand of
   Blockchains
SO FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH
AB When an author under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published the paper "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" in 2008, the first cryptocurrency using the new blockchain technology was introduced. Over the last decade, more than 1,000 different cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin were developed and Bitcoin's currency had almost reached an equivalent value of 20,000 $/BTC. After recognizing the disrupting momentum that the blockchain technology generated, scientists started to develop blockchain use cases for the energy sector. However, the scientific literature so far offers only rough and incomplete estimations when questions about the current and future energy consumption of the Bitcoin network are raised. This paper introduces a new scenario model to estimate the mining power demand of the Bitcoin and Ethereum network. Six scenarios are developed on the basis of mining hardware efficiency and network parameter data. The results show that an increase of the mining hardware efficiency will only have a limited impact on the overall power demand of blockchain networks. Furthermore, the current power demand of the Ethereum network is in the range from 0.6 to 3 GW and therefore, is similar to the one of Bitcoin. In case of linear growth of the block difficulty and sigmoidal increase of the hardware efficiency until the year of 2025, the mining power demand for the Bitcoin blockchain will be approximately 8 GW. Furthermore, the model and the scenarios are adaptable to other cryptocurrencies that use the proof-of-work consensus algorithm to create scenarios for their future power demand.

TI Dimensional Pathological Personality Predicting Personality Disorders:
   Comparison of the DAPP-BQ and PID-5 Shortened Versions in a Spanish
   Community Sample
SO JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT
AB This study explored the psychometric properties of the shortened forms of The Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP-BQ) and The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 (PID-5) in a large cohort from a Spanish community and compared simultaneously the predictive power with regard to personality disorders (PDs) scores in the International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE). The IPDE is a self-report inventory of 77 items. Each item measures a criterion and a dimensional score can be obtained for each personality disorder. Both shortened forms (named DAPP-90 and PID-5/SF, respectively) obtained a good structural validity and reliability. Linear regression analysis showed that both questionnaires were predictive of the PDs scores. DAPP-90 factors explained about 25% of PDs variance (37% of the PDs clusters). Facets slightly increased the percentages accounting for PDs variance and clusters to 31% and 43%, respectively. PID-5/SF factors, meanwhile, explained 23% of PDs and 33% of PDs clusters, while the facets accounted for 25% of PDs and 37% of clusters. It is concluded that both questionnaires were good instruments for measuring pathological personality, and predicted a similar part of the variance in PDs. However, given that neither the DAPP-90 nor the PID-5/SF accounted for all the variation in PDs, categorical classification of the broader set of PDs may continue to be desired by some researchers and practicing clinicians.

AB Besides recording transfers of currency, the Bitcoin blockchain is being used to save metadata - i.e. arbitrary pieces of data which do not affect transfers of bitcoins. This can be done by using different techniques, and for different purposes. For instance, a growing number of protocols embed metadata in the blockchain to certify and transfer the ownership of a variety of assets beyond cryptocurrency. A point of debate in the Bitcoin community is whether metadata negatively impact on the effectiveness of Bitcoin with respect to its primary function. This paper is a systematic analysis of the usage of Bitcoin metadata over the years. We discuss all the known techniques to embed metadata in the Bitcoin blockchain; we then extract metadata, and analyse them from different angles.

TI Supporting private data on Hyperledger Fabric with secure multiparty
   computation
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Hyperledger Fabric is a "permissioned" blockchain architecture, providing a consistent distributed ledger, shared by a set of "peers" that must all have the same view of its state. For many applications, it is desirable to keep private data on the ledger, but the same-view principle makes it challenging to implement. In this paper, we explore supporting private data on Fabric using secure multiparty computation (MPC). In our solution, peers encrypt their private data before storing it on the chain and use secure MPC whenever such private data are needed in a transaction. We created a demo of our solution, implementing a bidding system where sellers list assets on the ledger with a secret reserve price, and bidders publish their bids on the ledger but keep secret the bidding price. We implemented a smart contract that runs the auction on this secret data, using a simple secure-MPC protocol that was built using the EMP-toolkit library. We identified two basic services that should be added to Hyperledger Fabric to support our solution, inspiring follow-up work to implement and add these services to the Hyperledger Fabric architecture.

TI Geoengineering and the blockchain: Coordinating Carbon Dioxide Removal
   and Solar Radiation Management to tackle future emissions
SO FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT
AB Geoengineering is a proposed response to anthropogenic global warming (AGW). Conventionally it consists of two strands: Solar Radiation Management (SRM), which is fast-acting, incomplete but inexpensive, and Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR), which is slower acting, more expensive, and comprehensive. Pairing SRM and CDR offers a contractually complete solution for future emissions if effectively-scaled and coordinated. SRM offsets warming, while CDR takes effect. We suggest coordination using a blockchain, i.e. smart contracts and a distributed ledger. Specifically, we integrate CDR futures with time and volume-matched SRM orders, to address emissions contractually before release. This provides an economically and environmentally proportionate solution to CO2 emissions at the wellhead, with robust contractual transparency, and minimal overhead cost.
   Our proposal offers a 'polluter pays' implementation of Long & Shepherds SRM 'bridge' concept. This 'polluter geoengineers' approach mandates and verifies emissions linked payments with minimal friction, delay, or cost. Finally, we compare alternative market designs against this proposal, finding that this proposal offers several advantages. We conclude that blockchain implementation of the 'polluter geoengineers' approach is attractive and feasible for larger wellhead contracts. We also identify a handful of advantages and disadvantages that merit further study.

TI Applying Diffie-Hellman Algorithm to Solve the Key Agreement Problem in
   Mobile Blockchain-based Sensing Applications
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Mobile blockchain has achieved huge success with the integration of edge computing services. This concept, when applied in mobile crowd sensing, enables transfer of sensor data from blockchain clients to edge nodes. Edge nodes perform proof-of-work on sensor data from blockchain clients and append validated data to the chain. With this approach, blockchain can be performed pervasively. However, securing sensitive sensor data in a mobile blockchain (client/edge node architecture) becomes imperative. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated framework for mobile blockchain which ensures key agreement between clients and edge nodes using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm. Also, the framework provides efficient encryption of sensor data using the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm. Finally, key agreement processes in the framework were analyzed and results show that key pairing between the blockchain client and the edge node is a non-trivial process.

TI Information Technology Outsourcing Chain: Literature Review and
   Implications for Development of Distributed Coordination
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The paper aims to analyse how the management science literature explains sustainable coordination and management of Information Technology (IT) outsourcing chains. The IT outsourcing theories,-that is, transaction cost theory, theory of agency, resource based view, activity based theory, contractual theory, partnership and alliance theory and stakeholder theory-are applied as a background to the analysis. A systematic literature review reveals that IT outsourcing is developed in collaborative networks and chains. There are some mechanisms identified in the literature for outsourcing chains' management, interchain sustainability, coordination and interchain activities' cohesion. The complexity of outsourcing relationships presented among outsourcers and outsourcees stimulate looking for new business models. Furthermore, outsourcing chains research would benefit from considering strategy-based theoretical discussions, relationship modelling and project management. The literature survey aims to present outsourcing chains in different aspects, that is, dynamics and agility, communication in chains, compensation and compliance, contracting, stakeholders, decision making models, governance problems, integration, performance measurement, project management and strategy development. This paper intends to emphasize that interchain coordination can be improved by enterprise architecture modelling as well as by the application of blockchain economy.

Authority-related news is defined as news that is related to government authority (including central bank) policies or talk. By using data from the largest cryptocurrency exchange in China, we find that investors' response to authority-related news is negative and significant in general. Moreover, we find that the abnormal trading volume and standard deviation of abnormal trading volume are significantly higher for authority-related news with higher readability, suggesting investors respond to the more readable authority-related news with more trading behaviour.

TI Bitcoin at High Frequency
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper studies the behaviour of Bitcoin returns at different sample frequencies. We consider high frequency returns starting from tick-by-tick price changes traded at the Bitstamp and Coinbase exchanges. We find evidence of a smooth intra-daily seasonality pattern, and an abnormal trade- and volatility intensity at Thursdays and Fridays. We find no predictability for Bitcoin returns at or above one day, though, we find predictability for sample frequencies up to 6 h. Predictability of Bitcoin returns is also found to be time-varying. We also study the behaviour of the realized volatility of Bitcoin. We document a remarkable high percentage of jumps above 80%. We also find that realized volatility exhibits: (i) long memory; (ii) leverage effect; and (iii) no impact from lagged jumps. A forecast study shows that: (i) Bitcoin volatility has become more easy to predict after 2017; (ii) including a leverage component helps in volatility prediction; and (iii) prediction accuracy depends on the length of the forecast horizon.

TI Statistical Arbitrage in Cryptocurrency Markets
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Machine learning research has gained momentum-also in finance. Consequently, initial machine-learning-based statistical arbitrage strategies have emerged in the U.S. equities markets in the academic literature, see e.g., Takeuchi and Lee (2013); Moritz and Zimmermann (2014); Krauss et al. (2017). With our paper, we pose the question how such a statistical arbitrage approach would fare in the cryptocurrency space on minute-binned data. Specifically, we train a random forest on lagged returns of 40 cryptocurrency coins, with the objective to predict whether a coin outperforms the cross-sectional median of all 40 coins over the subsequent 120 min. We buy the coins with the top-3 predictions and short-sell the coins with the flop-3 predictions, only to reverse the positions after 120 min. During the out-of-sample period of our backtest, ranging from 18 June 2018 to 17 September 2018, and after more than 100,000 trades, we find statistically and economically significant returns of 7.1 bps per day, after transaction costs of 15 bps per half-turn. While this finding poses a challenge to the semi-strong from of market efficiency, we critically discuss it in light of limits to arbitrage, focusing on total volume constraints of the presented intraday-strategy.

TI Bitcoin as a new asset class
SO MEDITARI ACCOUNTANCY RESEARCH
AB Purpose Bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency which currently holds the largest market capitalisation and is regarded as a standard example of a cryptocurrency. There is, however, no consensus as to the nature of the Bitcoin. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether Bitcoin represents a new asset class by building on prior research. Design/methodology/approach The prior literature on asset classes is explored in detail and then applied to the Bitcoin. Four key criteria of asset classes are discussed, namely, investability, politico-economic profile, correlation of returns and risk-reward profile. Statistical techniques are used to inform the conclusions for the third and fourth criteria. Findings This research finds that the Bitcoin represents a distinct alternative investment and asset class. There are significant opportunities for investment. The politico-economic profile of the decentralised and consensus-based Bitcoin is dissimilar to other asset classes. The Bitcoin shares little or no correlation with other asset classes. Using Sharpe Ratios, it is shown that the Bitcoin provides risk-adjusted returns over and above most asset classes. Research limitations/implications - The aim of this research is to present a normative exploration into the asset class nature of the Bitcoin and, as a result, the aim is not to create positivist generalisable conclusions. This paper does not address cryptocurrencies, other than Bitcoin and does not constitute a detailed manual on modern portfolio theory. Originality/value - This research adds to finance paradigm research on the Bitcoin by including a developing country perspective on Bitcoin as an asset class as prior studies have concentrated on developed country settings. Further, this research introduces recent economic data (2014 to 2017) in the form of daily observations to enhance prior understanding. It is important to understand if the Bitcoin represents an alternative investment and new asset class as this may affect investment decisions.

TI Testing Stylized Facts of Bitcoin Limit Order Books
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB The majority of electronic markets worldwide employ limit order books, and the recently emerging exchanges for cryptocurrencies pose no exception. With this work, we empirically analyze whether commonly observed empirical properties from established limit order exchanges transfer to the cryptocurrency domain. Based on the literature, we establish a structured methodological framework to conduct analyses in a systematic and comprehensive way. We then present results from a unique and extensive limit order data set acquired from major cryptocurrency exchanges for the currency pair Bitcoin to US Dollar. We recover many observations from mature markets, such as a symmetry between the average ask and the average bid side of the order book, autocorrelation in returns on the smallest time scales only, volatility clustering and the timing of large trades. We also observe some idiosyncrasies: The distributions of trade size and limit order prices deviate from commonly observed patterns. Also, we find limit order books to be relatively shallow and liquidity costs to be relatively high when compared to established markets.

TI Oviposition preference of Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae) at
   different times after pruning 'Italia' table grapes grown in Brazil
SO JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE
AB Studies investigating oviposition preference of Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824) in table grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) cultivated in the S (a) over tildeo Francisco River Valley can provide important information to guide control measures, therefore minimizing damage caused by this species in the region. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oviposition preference of C. capitata females for berries cv. 'Italia' collected at five different times (60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 d after production pruning [DAPP]), representing five grapevine growth stages. We also assessed the performance of immature stages of C. capitata regarding the physiological development of the berry. The total soluble solid content was significantly higher in berries at more advanced physiological developmental stages (90 and 100 DAPP). Conversely, these berries showed the lowest values of firmness and titratable acidity. With the onset of physiological development, the average number of punctures per berry increased and reached 5.2 per berry in 100 DAPP berries. The infestation level and pupal weight showed a positive correlation with the growth stage. The highest recovery of pupae was observed in 100 DAPP berries (1.54). Pupal viability values ranged from 50.9 to 64.7% independent of berry maturity stage. The physiological developmental stage of the berry did not affect offspring sex ratio. Results obtained suggest that regardless of the female preference for laying eggs on berries in a more advanced physiological developmental stage, females can initiate the attack to bunches of this cultivar at 60 DAPP, even if the berries have unfavorable physicochemical parameters for oviposition and development of larvae.

TI Efficient Local Secret Sharing for Distributed Blockchain Systems
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB Blockchain systems store transaction data in the form of a distributed ledger where each peer is to maintain an identical copy. Blockchain systems resemble repetition codes, incurring high storage cost. Recently, distributed storage blockchain (DSB) systems have been proposed to improve storage efficiency by incorporating secret sharing, private key encryption, and information dispersal algorithms. However, the DSB results in significant communication cost when peer failures occur due to denial of service attacks. In this letter, we propose a new DSB approach based on a local secret sharing (LSS) scheme with a hierarchical secret structure of one global secret and several local secrets. The proposed DSB approach with LSS improves the storage and recovery communication costs.

TI Using High-Frequency Entropy to Forecast Bitcoin's Daily Value at Risk
SO ENTROPY
AB In this paper we investigate the ability of several econometrical models to forecast value at risk for a sample of daily time series of cryptocurrency returns. Using high frequency data for Bitcoin, we estimate the entropy of intraday distribution of logreturns through the symbolic time series analysis (STSA), producing low-resolution data from high-resolution data. Our results show that entropy has a strong explanatory power for the quantiles of the distribution of the daily returns. Based on Christoffersen's tests for Value at Risk (VaR) backtesting, we can conclude that the VaR forecast build upon the entropy of intraday returns is the best, compared to the forecasts provided by the classical GARCH models.

TI Digital Currency Design for Sustainable Active Debris Removal in Space
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB Orbital debris (OD) remains as an obstacle to further space development. While efforts are ongoing to avoid newly launched objects becoming debris, the number of debris would still continue to grow because of collisions. Active debris removal (ADR) is an effective measure, but building a sustainable economic model for ADR remains as a difficult problem. We propose that the cost of removal can be paid by circulating digital currency tokens on a blockchain platform whose values may decrease and/or increase over time, issued by global cooperation (a consortium) of parties interested in space development, in exchange with proofs of ADR. The tokens pay their cost by themselves through contributions by the token holders, who are likely to be benefited by removal of debris. This scheme imposes virtually no cost to the consortium. We have generalized this concept as proof of disposal, which, we believe, provides a more accountable foundation for solving social problems with digital currency than many Initial Coin or Cryptoasset Offering in practice today. We evaluated the feasibility of our proposal through a simulation. We conclude that dynamic estimation of the economic values of each ADR and automated pricing of tokens that represent the OD being removed are indeed possible. Actual prototyping of the proposed digital currency system is ongoing.

TI A general form of smart contract for decentralized energy systems

SO NATURE ENERGY
AB Smart contract platforms have the potential to allow shared automatic control of energy transfer within networks in a replicable, secure, verifiable and trustworthy way. Here we present a general form of smart contract which captures the elements needed for shared control that will help formalize decentralization. Two mechanisms were defined for agreement of control instructions for a medium-voltage direct-current (MVDC) link connecting two separately operated 33 kV distribution networks. These were instantiated as smart contracts and were evaluated in terms of cost and the computational requirements for their execution. Real network and converter data from the ANGLE-DC demonstration project were used to model the MVDC link. We demonstrate that using smart contracts to agree control instructions between different parties is feasible. The potential for shared control using smart contracts gives operators and regulators a way of defining and decentralizing operating responsibilities within energy systems.

TI CaACBIM: A Context-aware Access Control Model for BIM
SO INFORMATION
AB A building information model (BIM) is of upmost importance with a full life-time cycle in architecture engineering and construction industry. Smart construction relies on BIM to manipulate information flow, data flow, and management flow. Currently, BIM has been explored mainly for information construction and utilization, but there exist few works concerning information security, e. g., audits of critical models and exposure of sensitive models. Moreover, few BIM systems have been proposed to make use of new computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, blockchain and Internet of Things. In this paper, we propose a Context-aware Access Control (CaAC) model for BIM systems on mobile cloud architectures. BIM data can be confidentially accessed according to contexts in a fine-grained manner. We describe functions of CaAC formally by illustrating location-aware access control and time-aware access control. CaAC model can outperform role-based access control for preventing BIM data leakage by distinguishing contexts. In addition, grouping algorithms are also presented for flexibility, in which basic model (user grouping based on user role permissions) and advanced model (user grouping based on user requests) are differentiated. Compared with the traditional role-based access control model, security and feasibility of CaAC are remarkably improved by distinguishing an identical role with multiple contexts. The average efficiency is improved by 2n/(2n-p-q), and time complexity is O(n)

SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB In recent years, the status of cooperation and innovation has become increasingly important. Research on the behavior of production, education, and research organizations has attracted widespread attention. Blockchain technology is considered as another subversive technology following cloud computing, wireless sensor networks, and big data. It is highly concerned by governments, financial institutions, and technology companies. Blockchain technology is essentially a technical solution that collectively maintains a reliable database through a decentralized, high-trust way. Blockchain WEB technology has not only used in financial and other fields, but also has a great potential for application in the fields of production, education, and research. It has expected to play an important role in the establishment of a trust mechanism in the Internet + production, research, and innovation and promote education. Drawing on the experience in blockchain applications in the financial sector, the blockchain in the education sector mainly embodies six application modes: building individual science credit data, creating an intelligent education Taobao platform, developing a degree certificate system, and building a new ecology of open educational resources. Of course, due to the uniqueness and complexity of the trust field in the cooperation innovation of industry, universities, and research institutes, the application of blockchain technology is also faced with difficulties in the application, promotion, and operation of production and research, fuzzy ownership of educational big data, limited data storage space, and potential safety problems of blockchain technology. There are many challenges such as the privacy protection risks of teachers and students.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB The Internet of things is the next stage in the evolution of the Internet that is being materialized with the integration of billions of smart objects. The state-of-the-art communication technologies have enabled the previously isolated devices to become an active part of the Internet. This constant connectivity opens new avenues for novel applications such as the realization of social Internet of things and its subdomain the social Internet of vehicles. Socializing requires sharing of information that entails trust, especially in an open and broad social environment. This article highlights the key factors involved in conceptualizing an efficient trust model for social Internet of vehicles. Furthermore, it focuses on the unique challenges involved in designing the trust models for social Internet of vehicles. Several trust models exist in literature; however, most of the existing trust models are specific to their domains, for example, Internet of things, social Internet of things, or general vehicular networks. This article presents a brief review of the trust models that have the potential to be implemented in Social Internet of vehicles. Finally, the authors present an overview of how trending concepts and emerging technologies like blockchain and fog computing can assist in developing a trust-based social Internet of vehicles model for high-efficiency, decentralized architecture and dynamic nature of vehicular networks.

TI Hydrophilic and photo-crosslinkable diblock copolymers employed for
   robust antifouling membrane coatings
SO APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE
AB Bifunctional copolymers bearing hydrophilic units and photo-crosslinkable units were prepared and employed to coat PVDF membranes and thus improve their antifouling properties and coating stability. A series of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (mPEG-b-PHEMA) diblock copolymers were prepared via the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) using different mPEG macroinitiators, and then reacted with cinnamoyl chloride to obtain methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-cinnamoyloxyethyl methacrylate) (mPEG-b-PCEMA). Coating PVDF microfilter membranes with mPEG-b-PCEMA and subsequently photo-crosslinking the PCEMA block yielded crosslinked copolymer coatings. The successful preparation of these coatings was confirmed by SEM, TGA, ATR-FTIR and XPS characterization. The hydrophilicity of the membrane increased along with the amount of diblock copolymer coating on the coated PVDF membrane. Based on the results of BSA adsorption and filtration experiments, the antifouling properties of the coated PVDF membrane remarkably improved. Furthermore, the mPEG block chain length and its content in the diblock copolymer had a significant effect on the surface properties of the coated PVDF membrane. More importantly, the copolymer coatings were very stable thanks to the crosslinking of the PCEMA chains of the diblock copolymer.

TI The fragility of decentralised trustless socio-technical systems
SO EPJ DATA SCIENCE
AB The blockchain technology promises to transform finance, money and even governments. However, analyses of blockchain applicability and robustness typically focus on isolated systems whose actors contribute mainly by running the consensus algorithm. Here, we highlight the importance of considering trustless platforms within the broader ecosystem that includes social and communication networks. As an example, we analyse the flash-crash observed on 21st June 2017 in the Ethereum platform and show that a major phenomenon of social coordination led to a catastrophic cascade of events across several interconnected systems. We propose the concept of emergent centralisation to describe situations where a single system becomes critically important for the functioning of the whole ecosystem, and argue that such situations are likely to become more and more frequent in interconnected socio-technical systems. We anticipate that the systemic approach we propose will have implications for future assessments of trustless systems and call for the attention of policy-makers on the fragility of our interconnected and rapidly changing world.

TI Taxonomy of digital community currency platforms*
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
AB Community currencies are used to pay for products or services within specific groups defined by geographical boundaries or specific common interests. Financial crises, social emergence in developing countries, and increased access to digital devices have stimulated a growing number of communities worldwide to develop digital currency projects. These projects use technologies ranging from traditional plastic cards to mobile phones and blockchain technologies. Following the design science research approach, this paper analyzes digital community currencies (DCCs) by developing a taxonomy based on platform architecture, governance, transactionality and virtuality. By investigating 22 DCC platforms around the world, 4 groups were distinguished: local, proprietary, commons and cyber. The identification of these four different groups of digital community currencies allows us to better discuss the potentials and limitations of each one of them. The presented taxonomy can be useful to researchers and practitioners both to explain and to design DCC platforms. Discussing each of the emerging categories from the proposed taxonomy helps us to provide insights into DCCs, offering a new theoretical frame for investigating the particular case of digital payment platforms.

AB In the current era, blockchain based system getting a lot of attention across different industries especially in the domain of supply chain because of its streamlined nature at the same time keep the privacy intact as well as more efficient than the conventional system. However the traditional supply chain faced lot of challenges these days because of the complex networks. Blockchain integrated with IoT framework has the potential to overcome the challenges faced by the conventional systems across industries. Basically the IoT integrated blockchain system provides enough benefits such as connecting the link between the flows in the supply chain to improve the efficiency of the supply chain network, makes the system transparent that can reduce the code of conduct violation throughout the supply chain networks, the immutable properties helps the stakeholders to trace the products throughout the networks. Even though blockchain based system provides enough benefits across industries, so far the implementation rate is very low because of the lack of knowledge about the benefits of blockchain system as well as lack of understanding about how and why it is needed in their fields. In this paper we will highlight the difference between the conventional supply chain as well as blockchain based supply chain and the benefits of implementing blockchain in different sectors such as automotive, pharmaceutical, food industry, retail. This article will highlights the problems currently facing by the above mentioned industries by using the conventional supply chain as well as the solutions to the problems provide the blockchain based systems in those industries. This articles helps the people across sectors to understand the benefits of the blockchain based system in their respect fields as well as implement it to improve the efficiency of the overall system.

AB A fundamental problem for electronic commerce is the buying and selling of digital goods between individuals that may not know or trust each other. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed by the use of trusted third-parties such as credit-card companies, mediated escrows, legal adjudication, or reputation systems. Despite the rise of blockchain protocols as a way to send payments without trusted third parties, the important problem of exchanging a digital good for payment without trusted third parties has been paid much less attention. We refer to this problem as the Buyer and Seller's Dilemma and present for it a dual-deposit escrow trade protocol which uses double-sided payment deposits in conjunction with simple cryptographic primitives, and that can be implemented using a blockchain-based smart contract. We analyze our protocol as an extensive-form game and prove that the Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium for this game is for both the buyer and seller to cooperate and behave honestly. We address this problem under the assumption that the digital good being traded is known and verifiable, with a fixed price known to both parties.

AB Blockchain techniques are attracting growing interest due to their capability of immutable and anonymous recording without any centralized authority. One of the difficulties blockchain researchers are facing is a lack of ways to verify behaviors of large scale blockchain networks. In this demonstration, we present SimBlock, a blockchain network simulator. It simulates the peer-to-peer network of a public blockchain, e.g., Bitcoin, which consists of thousands of nodes, as well as parameters related to a blockchain and its network are flexibly configurable. SimBlock can also visualize nodes' behavior and block propagation. By giving some example studies, such as exploring better neighbor selection strategies and assessing the influence of relay networks, we show that SimBlock can facilitate blockchain network research.

TI Blockchain Token Economics: A Mean-Field-Type Game Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper studies the blockchain cryptographic tokens by means of mean-field-type game theory. It introduces the variance-aware utility function per decision-maker to capture the risk of cryptographic tokens associated with the uncertainties of technology adoption, network security, regulatory legislation, and market volatility. We establish a relationship between the network characteristics, token price, number of token holders, and token supply. Both in-chain diversification and cross-chain diversification among tokens are examined by using a mean-variance approach. The results suggest that the number of tokens in circulation needs to be adjusted in order to capture risk-awareness and self-regulatory behavior in blockchain token economics. The Sharpe and Modigliani ratios for cryptographic tokens are revisited.

TI Bitcoin: competitor or complement to gold?
SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB This study seeks to address whether Bitcoin ever match or even replace gold as a safe haven. To this end, we use a dynamic Markov-switching copula model to test the complementarity and substitutability among Bitcoin and gold within two risk scenarios (i.e., low-and high-risk regimes). Our results reveal a positive and strong correlation between gold and Bitcoin returns coinciding with specific economic and political events. Gold and Bitcoin benefit from the same economic conditions. This suggests that gold and Bitcoin are likely to be complementary, rather than in competition with each other. Gold could act as a diversifier for investors in digital assets. But the Bitcoin have a lot to teach gold in terms of the efficient transfer of value.

TI Should Bitcoin be used to help devastated economies? Evidence from

SO ECONOMICS BULLETIN
AB The worldwide heightened economic uncertainty in countries like Venezuela, India, Britain, and Italy has strengthened more demand for Bitcoin. The deadlock between Greece and creditors doesn't seem to be going away and Greeks are very tired of the most punishing austerity measures connected to repayments of the loans. Greek people, who become increasingly mistrustful of their government, found solace in the Bitcoin as a refuge asset. The novelty of this paper lies in its methodological approach, which can pinpoint the dynamic effects of uncertainty surrounding the debt crisis on the interest in Bitcoin as an alternative to conventional and state-sanctioned banking system. Our findings confirm the great resilience of Bitcoin during periods of turmoil, highlighting its potential safe haven ability against uncertainty.

TI Energy Policy Instruments for Distributed Ledger Technology Empowered

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Peer-to-peer energy trading and next generation local energy market mechanisms are expected to provide new use cases and opportunities within the future sharing economy landscape. To this anticipation, we propose alternative incentive mechanisms as energy policy instruments that can be used by policy makers for directly supporting local energy producers, and hence indirectly the consumers, at current local energy markets using capabilities provided by contemporary distributed ledger technology. Under such peer-to-peer local market setting, we first detail market pricing and relevant market parameters thoroughly, and then we discuss fair incentive distribution to local producers in detail, by means of two distinct incentive systems what we call as the fixed stipend and the decaying stipend incentive mechanisms, respectively. We provide an analysis of market pricing and market parameters under German power market conditions, and an illustration of proposed support instruments with resorting to three scenarios experimented on a local energy market test bed that is equipped with realistic energy generation and consumption profiles for its participants.

AB Today's e-health system is centralized. This system obliges all users (patients and healthcare staff) to have a high level of trust in the intermediary who stores the data. Moreover, healthcare employees must trust that their patients are providing authentic medical records and are not altering them in order to obtain drugs for illegal purposes. The solution proposed in this paper is a new blockchain-based architecture for the creation of an e-health system. In this architecture, wireless sensor networks (WSN) will be used in association with a WSN controller v.2 to supervise patients and their testing by healthcare staff. Transactions between blockchain and WSN are made through smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries and preventing human error. This new model facilitates a distributed ledger, creating an e-health system that is much more optimized than the current one.

AB Blockchain miners processing the transactions and generating blocks are rational and incentivized by financial rewards. Prior research in blockchain security studied such financial incentives for the miners and identified attacks based on withholding and delaying block submissions. Among such attacks, the fork-after-withholding (FAW) attack is the state of the art and provides practical incentives to the rational attacker by increasing its reward at the expense of the rest of the miners in the compromised pool. To defend against FAW attack, we propose Silent Timestamping, which has the mining pool manager enforce the ordering of the shares. Implemented at the mining pool manager, Silent Timestamping does not require networking nor any behavior- or implementation-changes in the miners; the lack of the implementation overheads distinguish Silent Timestamping from other schemes which have been proposed but had limited success in practice. We analyze the optimal attacker behavior against Silent Timestamping and the effectiveness of Silent Timestamping against FAW attack. Silent Timestamping effectively nullifies the reward gain of the FAW attack and reduces the optimal FAW attacker strategy to be either the suboptimal block-withholding attack (which never submits the withheld block in the compromised pool and provides limited incentives for a rational attacker) or honest mining.

AB In a decentralized vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy trading among electric vehicles (EVs), there is a need of a highly secure and privacy protected transaction environment. With the advent of digital currencies like Bitcoin, most of the blockchain applications incorporate a similar cryptocurrency system for secure processing. In this work, we propose a permissioned blockchain based energy trading among EVs to enhance security and privacy of the EV user's information. We introduce, a new cryptocurrency "ETcoin" for energy trading among EVs. All the matched bids comprises of traded energy unit and ETcoins transferred are stored in blockchain. The transaction graph formed by energy trade can be analyzed as a large scale graph processing using Big Data analytics. Existing works have not addressed blockchain analytics for processing large transaction graphs of energy trading. All the blockchain transactions submitted in a pre-defined period are considered for analytics. We propose an EnergyTradeRank (ETR) algorithm for Blockchain analytics of the large scale transaction graphs. ETR algorithm inherently applies the weighted ranking approach, which considers both the edge as well as vertex properites of graph to calculate the ETR Score for each EV during a traded period. Transaction graph analytics on energy trading acts as a proof-of-activity and it also help in incentivizing the EVs with maximum satisfiable participation in the blockchain environment. We implemented the blockchain based proof-of-concept (POC) using IBMs hyperledger fabric and composer with minimum transaction latency and in-time modeling of each participant to the system. Transaction graph analytics is implemented via an open source Apache Spark's GraphX library for a realtime distributed dataflow processing. Transactions are modelled as edge triplets on several machines and ETR score for every vertex is computed parallelly to converge at a set tolerance value. Simulated results show that the algorithm converges faster and scales better as the number of parallel machines increases. We also analyzed that the overall incentive gain for EVs with maximum, truthful and committed participation increases and thus promotes active participation in the system.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCY REGULATION IN THE BRICS COUNTRIES AND THE EURASIAN

SO BRICS LAW JOURNAL
AB This article presents the results of a comparative analysis of the legislative approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the BRICS countries and the Eurasian Economic Union. During the analysis, regulatory legal acts and draft laws, including material on judicial practice, of the Russian Federation, China, India, Brazil, the Republic of South Africa, the Republic of Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia were studied. The use of a comparative-legal method makes it possible to develop recommendations about the development of legislation on the circulation of cryptocurrencies within the BRICS countries. The assessment of the experience of EEU countries, and especially that of the Republic of Belarus, has great importance since the Russian Federation is a member country of both the EEU and BRICS. Comparative analysis was achieved by taking into account such key points as the existence of a regulatory framework, regulation of transaction taxation and counteracting the legalization of profits from crime. The results of the analysis are presented for each country separately and then systematized in the form of an analytical table. Based on the analysis, three approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrencies are identified: conservative, liberal and neutral.
   The study of the experiences of the BRICS and EEU countries allowed the authors to conclude that these countries need to formulate similar requirements for the regulation of cryptocurrencies so as to avoid the migration of investment and capital to other countries which have a more liberal approach.

TI An Agent-Based Artificial Market Model for Studying the Bitcoin Trading
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The objective of this paper is to simulate the trading of the currency pair BTC/USD, investigating through the theory of the genetic algorithms the best sets of trading strategies, simulating through a realistic order book the bitcoin price formation, and reproducing a bitcoin price series that exhibits some stylized facts found in real-time price series. In this artificial market model two kinds of agents, Chartists and Random traders, perform trading. Chartists trade through the application of trading rules. Specifically, a part of Chartists trades applying the best sets of trading rules selected by a genetic algorithm that simulates a trading system, based on four technical analysis indicators, searching for parameters of each indicator that guarantee the highest profits in the training period; the remaining part trades applying trading rules choosing their parameters in a random way. On the contrary random trader's trade without applying any trading strategy, issuing in a random way sell or buy orders. Results show that the best sets of rules found to guarantee the highest profits both in the training and in the testing periods, and perform well also in the artificial market model where the Chartists who adopt the best sets of trading rules are able to achieve higher profits.

TI The Evolution of Blockchain: A Bibliometric Study
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain as emerging technology is revolutionizing several industries, and its abundant privileges have opened up a bunch of research directions in various industries; thereby, it has acquired many interests from the research community. The rapid evolution of blockchain research papers in recent years has resulted in a need to conduct research studies that investigate a detailed analysis of the current body of knowledge in this field. To address this need, a few review papers have been published to report the latest accomplishments and challenges of blockchain technology from different perspectives. Nonetheless, there has not been any bibliometric analysis of the state of the art in blockchain where Web of Science (WoS) has been taken into consideration as a literature database. Hence, a thorough analysis of the current body of knowledge in blockchain research through a bibliometric study would be needed. In this paper, we performed a bibliometric analysis of all Blockchain's conference papers, articles, and review papers that have been indexed by WoS from 2013 to 2018. We have analyzed those collected papers against five research questions. The results revealed some valuable insights, including yearly publications and citations trends, hottest research areas, top-ten influential papers, favorite publication venues, and most supportive funding bodies. The findings of this paper offer several implications that can be used as a guideline by both fresh and experienced researchers to establish a baseline before initiating a blockchain research project in the future.

While both delta updates and blockchain technology are now used in different areas, this paper studies the feasibility of combining the two technologies for firmware updates on resource constrained IoT devices such as Wi-Fi smart plugs and sensors. The paper identifies the scenarios where delta updates may not work and proposes a private blockchain network-based IoT device firmware integrity verification and update mechanism. The proposed private blockchain mechanism for integrity verification utilizes a tamper-proof blockchain server. The proposed solution aims to enhance firmware update performance.

With the exponential growth, IoMT is having a huge influence in our everyday life style. Instead of going to the hospital, patient clinical related data is remotely observed and processed in a real time data system and then is transferred to the third party for future use such as the cloud. IoMT is intensive data domain with a continuous growing rate which means that we must secure a large amount of sensitive data without being tampered. Blockchain is a temper proved digital ledger which provides us peer-to-peer communication. Blockchain enables communication between non-trusting members without any intermediary.

TI A Novel Attribute-Based Access Control Scheme Using Blockchain for IoT
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the sharp increase in the number of intelligent devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained more and more attention and rapid development in recent years. It effectively integrates the physical world with the Internet over existing network infrastructure to facilitate sharing data among intelligent devices. However, its complex and large-scale network structure brings new security risks and challenges to IoT systems. To ensure the security of data, traditional access control technologies are not suitable to be directly used for implementing access control in IoT systems because of their complicated access management and the lack of credibility due to centralization. In this paper, we proposed a novel attribute-based access control scheme for IoT systems, which simplifies greatly the access management. We use blockchain technology to record the distribution of attributes in order to avoid single point failure and data tampering. The access control process has also been optimized to meet the need for high efficiency and lightweight calculation for IoT devices. The security and performance analysis show that our scheme could effectively resist multiple attacks and be efficiently implemented in IoT systems.

SO CLINICS IN DERMATOLOGY
AB Change is an absolute so long as time does not stand still. We should expect it, embrace it, and try to predict its direction. Dermatology, as a specialty practice, has been changing rapidly over the past 30 years concurrent with the changes in medicine. What are these changes, how did they come about, and what may be the consequences? The goal of this review is to follow the march of time, as we move from one era to the other in step with what is happening in the world as a whole and the United States in particular. The growth of our specialty, Dermatology, is divided into 3 eras which are quite different in generational cultures. The first era spanning the 1980s and 1990s is dubbed as "old school." The second era begins with the new century, 2000 until today. This era will forever be remembered as the business era, the rise of elite cultures, and the losses and threats to academia. The third era begins now; it is that of technology which is fast progressing into the future. One can theoretically project what may occur during this technologic revolution and the directions in medicine as a whole. Dermatology can be at the forefront of this era or it could be lost as a whole if we do nothing to keep up. These eras are based on my personal experience as a dermatologist in a large academic institution in the United States and may not apply to other communities or societies elsewhere. The United States serves as a good example of a western technologically oriented society that is often emulated by others. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain Design for an Embedded System
SO LEDGER
AB This paper proposes a blockchain-based mapping protocol for distributed robotic systems running on embedded hardware. This protocol was developed for a robotic system designed to locomote on lattice structures for space applications. A consensus mechanism, Proof of Validity, is introduced to allow the effort of mining blocks to correlate with the desired tasks the robotic system was designed for. These robots communicate using peer-to-peer LoRa radio. Options, trade-offs and considerations for implementing blockchain technology on an embedded system with wireless radio communication are explored and discussed.

TI Consortium Blockchain Based Data Aggregation and Regulation Mechanism
   for Smart Grid
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Flexible regulation of smart grid is vital for grid operation. This paper proposes a smart grid data aggregation and regulation mechanism based on consortium blockchain, and its signcryption algorithm can be applied to multidimensional data acquisition and multiple receivers in the consortium blockchain. In the process of regulation, the control center, the grid operator, and the equipment supplier receive fixed-height blocks from the blockchain and obtain plaintext from the decryption. Each receiver analyzes the multidimensional data and formulates corresponding control policies for individual users. Grid operators implement user power regulation by feedback on smart contracts. The security analysis and performance comparison show that the proposed scheme has advantages in computing and communication costs while meeting security requirements for confidentiality and data integrity.

AB Ideal RFID systems used in product lifecycle should satisfy high confidentiality, anonymity, integrity and high availability. However, collection and distribution of RFID data are subject to various security concerns. RFID middleware systems are likely to suffer from parameter manipulation and eavesdropping, raising privacy concerns. Most recent works focus on access control schemes with models based on Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). These schemes, to enhance the security and privacy, are based on centralized models. In this paper, we present an ABAC model using chaincode in RFID systems. Our ABAC system is based on Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain, which is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains. Our ABAC model uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the ABAC model in order to ensure the security of RFID systems. It should also be noted that the RFID system presented is based on the EPCGlobal standard.

TI Flexible and Efficient Blockchain-Based ABE Scheme With Multi-Authority
   for Medical on Demand in Telemedicine System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Telemedicine offers a medical-on-demand (MoD) service from a distance. This technology is designed to overcome distance barriers and improve the process of accessing medical services in distant rural communities. With the development of cloud computing, the MoD services in the telemedicine system are provided by the Cloud Service Provider (CSP). This CSP connects the patient and the medical staff in different places with both convenience and fidelity. Meanwhile, the outsourcing healthcare data on public cloud platforms bring some new challenges on the security. Although attribute-based encryption (ABE) algorithm realizes flexible and fine-grained access control, a large number of patients subscribe or unsubscribe the different medical services frequently in the cloud, which takes a huge cost for membership management. In this paper, an ABE scheme is presented to achieve the dynamic authentication and authorization with higher flexibility and efficiency for the MoD services in telemedicine system. On the one hand, when the patient alters his ordered service, it requires no updating on the parameters for those whose statuses remain unchanged. We construct an independent-update key policy ABE scheme in the distributed telemedicine system that aims to updates patient's keys separately, and there are multiple authorities to manage this system altogether which is more similar to the real situation. On the other hand, by using blockchain and distributed database technologies, the private healthcare data stored in public cloud is protected in integrity, which avoids the misdiagnosis accident from the inaccurate electronic health records distorted by a malicious user or authority from the inner cloud. Finally, we analyze the collusion attack in multiple authorities and formally prove the security of this protocol in a standard model. After comparing and simulating, the results of this work show a better performance.

TI Edge Computing in 5G: A Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB 5G is the next generation cellular network that aspires to achieve substantial improvement on quality of service, such as higher throughput and lower latency. Edge computing is an emerging technology that enables the evolution to 5G by bringing cloud capabilities near to the end users (or user equipment, UEs) in order to overcome the intrinsic problems of the traditional cloud, such as high latency and the lack of security. In this paper, we establish a taxonomy of edge computing in 5G, which gives an overview of existing state-of-the-art solutions of edge computing in 5G on the basis of objectives, computational platforms, attributes, 5G functions, performance measures, and roles. We also present other important aspects, including the key requirements for its successful deployment in 5G and the applications of edge computing in 5G. Then, we explore, highlight, and categorize recent advancements in edge computing for 5G. By doing so, we reveal the salient features of different edge computing paradigms for 5G. Finally, open research issues are outlined.

AB This bitcoin system is a system made to support transactions between users without the help of any financial institution. The Bitcoin Exchange is a service that enables exchanges of bitcoins mined by others with cash. To use this service, the miner should send bitcoins from his bitcoin wallet to the deposit address provided by the Exchange. The bitcoins delivered to the deposit address are automatically moved to one of the Exchange's bitcoin addresses by the Exchange system. Since what is known to the user is only the deposit address for the user, the user can only guess that the Exchange has taken the bitcoins from his deposit address when he/she sees the transfer of his/her bitcoins to another address. We will present a method to find out a few bitcoin addresses through preliminary work and find out the associated Exchange addresses using the characteristics of the deposit addresses and system addresses of the Exchange through transactions with the relevant addresses on the blockchain.

TI Cochain-SC: An Intra- and Inter-Domain Ddos Mitigation Scheme Based on
   Blockchain Using SDN and Smart Contract
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the exponential growth in the number of insecure devices, the impact of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks is growing rapidly. Existing DDoS mitigation schemes are facing obstacles due to low flexibility, lack of resources, and high cost. The new emerging technologies, such as blockchain, introduce new opportunities for low-cost, efficient and flexible DDoS attacks mitigation across multiple domains. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach, called Cochain-SC, which combines two levels of mitigation, intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS mitigation. For intra-domain, we propose an effective DDoS mitigation method in the context of software defined networks (SDN); it consists of three schemes: (1) Intra Entropy-based scheme (I-ES) to measure, using sFlow, the randomness of data inside the domain; (2) Intra Bayes-based scheme (I-BS) to classify, based on entropy values, illegitimate flows; and (3) Intra-domain Mitigation (I-DM) scheme to effectively mitigate illegitimate flows inside the domain. For inter-domain, we propose a collaborative DDoS mitigation scheme based on blockchain; it uses the concept of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum's smart contracts) to facilitate the collaboration among SDN-based domains (i.e., Autonomous System: AS) to mitigate DDoS attacks. For this aim, we design a novel and secure scheme that allows multiple SDN-based domains to securely collaborate and transfer attack information in a decentralized manner. Combining intra- and inter-domain DDoS mitigation, Cochain-SC allows an efficient mitigation along the path of an ongoing attack and an effective mitigation near the origin of the attack. This allows reducing the enormous cost of forwarding packets, across multiple domains, which consist mostly of useless amplified attack traffic. To the best of our knowledge, Cochain-SC is the first scheme that proposes to deal with both intra-domain and inter-domain DDoS attacks mitigation combining SDN, blockchain and smart contract. The implementation of Cochain-SC is deployed on Ethereum official test network Ropsten. Moreover, we conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed approach; the experimental results show that Cochain-SC achieves flexibility, efficiency, security, cost effectiveness, and high accuracy in detecting illegitimate flows, making it a promising approach to mitigate DDoS attacks.

TI A Delay-Tolerant Payment Scheme Based on the Ethereum Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Digital banking as an essential service can be hard to access in remote, rural regions where the network connectivity is unavailable or intermittent. The payment operators like Visa and Mastercard often face difficulties reaching these remote, rural areas. Although micro-banking has been made possible by short message service or unstructured supplementary service data messages in some places, their security flaws and session-based nature prevent them from wider adoption. Global-level cryptocurrencies enable low-cost, secure, and pervasive money transferring among distributed peers, but are still limited in their ability to reach people in remote communities. We propose a blockchain-based digital payment scheme that can deliver reliable services on top of unreliable networks in remote regions. We focus on a scenario where a community-run base station provides reliable local network connectivity while intermittently connects to the broader Internet. We take advantage of the distributed verification guarantees of the Blockchain technology for financial transaction verification and leverage smart contracts for secure service management. In the proposed system, payment operators deploy multiple proxy nodes that are intermittently connected to the remote communities where the local blockchain networks, such as Ethereum are composed of miners, vendors, and regular users. Through probabilistic modeling, we devise design parameters for the blockchain network to realize robust operation over the top of the unreliable network. Furthermore, we show that the transaction processing time will not be significantly impacted due to the network unreliability through extensive emulations on a private Ethereum network. Finally, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed system by developing Near Field Communication (NFC)-enabled payment gateways on Raspberry-Pis, a mobile wallet application and mining nodes on off-the-shelf computers.

Blockchain manages the transactions database in a decentralized way replicated on all the nodes with no single governing authority. In this paper, we present a classification and taxonomy of different blockchain development platforms and simulators along with their consensus protocols, the types of supported blockchain networks and programming languages. We also assess the performance of a blockchain application for deployment at the UAE University (UAEU) versus increasing number of nodes, blocks and block size, on top of experimental network latencies and bandwidth between the nodes. Our results show that a large-scale deployment of blockchain at UAEU is feasible.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCY-RELATED CRIMES: KEY CRIMINOLOGICAL TRENDS
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB The authors have analyzed crimes connected with the use of virtual currency in the regional and international aspects. They introduce a new category of "cryptocrime" understood as the aggregate of publically dangerous acts, united by their common systemic characteristics, committed against or using the products of distributed registries (cryptocurrency, tokens and other forms of digital financial assets). They analyze each of the cryptocrime segments separately: illegal trade in psychoactive substances (narcotics, psychoactive substances, precursors), pornography and other prohibited content (including illegal services); laundering of criminal proceeds; theft of cryptocurrency and tokens. Using the scientific research methods (comparative, sociological, statistical analysis and extrapolation of data, building a trend line, etc.) the authors identify regularities in the dynamics of each type of cryptocrime as well as key factors facilitating them. The goal of the authors is to conduct a systemic examination of crimes committed against and using cryptocurrency and to determine the prospects of developing different segments of cryptocrime. To achieve this goal, they analyze qualitative and quantitative characteristics of illegal trade in narcotics and pornography, legalization of criminal proceeds and theft of digital assets. They name the anonymity of cryptocurrency as a factor facilitating illegal trade in drugs, while the growing scope of the legalization of criminal proceeds and theft is facilitated by the fact that cryptocurrency and tokens do not have a legal status as objects of civil law and objects of encroachments on property. The analysis allows the authors to conclude that without effective criminological measures the level of such crimes will continue to grow and may double by the end of 2019. According to the authors, the priority directions of international criminal policy in the sphere of cryptocrime prevention include determining cryptocurrencies' legal status, licensing cryptocurrency trade (stock exchange services, exchange platforms, companies issuing tokens), setting international standards of counteracting the legalization of criminal proceeds and the financing of terrorism, creating a cryptocrime database.

In this system signals of roll, pitch and yaw values retrieved from MPU6050 sensor (Inertial Measurement Unit) are analysed using Digital Time Wrapping to obtain DTW minimum distance to verify the identity of the user. In case of cryptocurrencies, we propose a system where private key is not stored anywhere but the same unique private key, assigned to the user by Blockchain, is generated every time with the help of method incorporating biometrics and machine learning. The required data will then be sent to blockchain with the help of IOT system to complete the transaction.

SE Studies in Computational Intelligence
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to a vast network of connected smart objects, leading to the development of cyber-physical pervasive frameworks. Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth and interest in developing smart systems, enabling the identification of innovative solutions for industrial, domestic, and agricultural sectors. Various applications have been built and deployed in IoT space that leverage the increasing ubiquity of radio-frequency identification (RFID), wireless, mobile, and sensor devices. However, the current IoT paradigm with traditional cloud-based architecture is not scaled for the future, and requires all data to be transferred to a central point for analysis and action. This centralized processing model presents numerous challenges with the future need to connect hundreds of billions of devices. The major bottlenecks are associated with various dimensions such as cost of connectivity, meaningful value creation from sensor data, reliability, establishing digital trust, traceability, preventing concentration of power, unmanageable complexity, security, privacy, and latency. One solution to overcome these hurdles is to bring the concept of decentralization to the IoT space to build distributed IoT. This paper presents the current state of the research on IoT and its potential business use cases along with a case study on distributed IoT. It also discusses various challenges and opportunities in decentralized ecosystems, along with open research questions and future directions.

TI A Blockchain-Based Authentication Protocol for WLAN Mesh Security Access
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB In order to deploy a secure WLAN mesh network, authentication of both users and APs is needed, and a secure authentication mechanism should be employed. However, some additional configurations of trusted third party agencies are still needed on-site to deploy a secure authentication system. This paper proposes a new block chain-based authentication protocol for WLAN mesh security access, to reduce the deployment costs and resolve the issues of requiring key delivery and central server during IEEE 802.11X authentication. This method takes the user's authentication request as a transaction, considers all the authentication records in the mesh network as the public ledger and realizes the effective monitoring of the malicious attack. Finally, this paper analyzes the security of the protocol in detail, and proves that the new method can solve the dependence of the authentication node on PKI and CA.

However, the cyberinfrastructure boundaries of healthcare organizations and privacy leakage threats place obstacles on the sharing of medical records. Blockchain, as a public ledger characterized by its transparency, tamper-evidence, trustlessness, and decentralization, can help build a secure medical data exchange network. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art schemes on secure and privacy-preserving medical data sharing of the past decade with a focus on blockchain-based approaches. We classify them into permissionless blockchain-based approaches and permissioned blockchain-based approaches and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss potential research topics on blockchain-based medical data sharing.

TI EFFECT OF BITCOIN FEE ON TRANSACTION-CONFIRMATION PROCESS
SO JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION
AB In Bitcoin system, transactions are prioritized according to transaction fees. Transactions without fees are given low priority and likely to wait for confirmation. Because the demand of micro payment in Bitcoin is expected to increase due to low remittance cost, it is important to quantitatively investigate how transactions with small fees of Bitcoin affect the transaction-confirmation time. In this paper, we analyze the transaction-confirmation time by queueing theory. We model the transaction-confirmation process of Bitcoin as a priority queueing system with batch service, deriving the mean transaction-confirmation time. Numerical examples show how the demand of transactions with low fees affects the transaction-confirmation time. We also consider the effect of the maximum block size on the transaction-confirmation time.

TI Sustainable Growth and Token Economy Design: The Case of Steemit
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Cryptocurrency blockchain technology is attracting worldwide attention, and the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) is increasing rapidly. This new economic trend, called cryptoeconomics, can program human behavior through incentive design. A cryptocurrency-based incentive system is not only transparent, but also allows businesses to substitute initial investment costs with cryptocurrency tokens until they are on a sustainable growth trajectory in terms of network effects. This study aims to propose a process for building a desirable model of a token economy, based on the case of Steemit-a blogging and social networking website that is creating high values due to its efficient token economy model. We suggest the following design process of a token economy model: (1) Determine token-business fit, (2) determine the chance of success, (3) determine the properties of token, (4) give tokens intrinsic value, (5) establish strategies to raise token value, (6) establish operational strategies of token economy system, (7) establish strategies for token liquidation, and (8) continue modifying the operational base. Considering cryptoeconomics is still at an early stage, it is expected that the guidelines on the token economy model suggested in this paper will lay a significant foundation for the development of cryptoeconomics research.

TI CRYPTOCURRENCIES: DEVELOPMENT, FEATURES AND CLASSIFICATION
SO FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB The advent of cryptocurrencies and rapid growth of crypto-networks heralded a new era in evolution of financial relations. The main goals achieved by introduction of cryptocurrencies included: a) removal of the third party (the government, banking and financial institutions) from transactions between the parties to a transfer; b) anonymity of the parties; c) transaction security. The governments of various countries of the world have a different stance as regards the use of cryptocurrencies, and in some cases, they consider this medium of exchange illegal. The transnational nature of transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the absence of physical borders for these transactions complicate legislative regulation of the circulation of cryptocurrencies in Ukraine.
   The use of cryptocurrencies has significant effect on the economies of Ukraine and other countries of the world due to easy dissemination and popularity of this technology and the growing capitalization of cryptocurrencies. The exchange of cryptocurrencies into fiduciary money and the possibility of gaining substantial profits on a cryptocurrency exchange due to high volatility of cryptocurrencies necessitate development, as soon as possible, of approaches to legislative regulation of both terminological apparatus related to circulation of cryptocurrencies and the exchange transaction procedures, profit taxation, etc. Considering the multisided nature of crypto-networks and the diversity of cryptocurrencies currently existing in the world (over 2000 variants as of today), classification of existing cryptocurrencies and definition of their features represents a contemporary task.
   This article characterizes development of blockchain technology that serves as the basis for the functioning of cryptocurrencies, defines their characteristic features, positive and innovative concepts implemented with their advent. Cryptocurrencies were classified based on various criteria (issue type, network decentralization, limitation on issue, controllability of cryptocurrency issue, etc.), and two groups of features typical either for all cryptocurrencies or for their certain variants were proposed. It was proposed to define a cryptocurrency as a variety of e-money used as an alternative additional currency and circulated within global computer networks on the basis of blockchain technology that envisages asymmetrical encryption and the use of various cryptographic protection methods.

TI Movement to market, currency to property: the rise and fall of Bitcoin
   as an anti-state movement, 2009-2014
SO SOCIO-ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Can social movements mobilize market devices to challenge the political-economic order? Focusing on Bitcoin, we argue that an effective anti-state market device needs to be durably 'counterearmarked', to use Viviana Zelizer's term, with radical meaning. This durability, however, requires that the movement build alliances with holders of political and economic power who also embrace the device's radical meaning, lest those actors reformat the device to suit their purposes. To make this case, we locate Bitcoin's radical origins in a performative project built on elements of Austrian monetary theory. We then track Bitcoin's dual transformation between 2009 and 2014: the anti-state movement gave way to a market featuring big financial players, and the Internal Revenue Service officially redefined the bitcoin currency as property. Understanding this dual transformation requires joining Zelizerian conceptions of money with theories of markets-and-movements on the one hand, and symbolic-cultural conceptions of the classificatory state on the other.

AB In the digital Economy 'Data is the new oil. In the last decade technology has disrupted every filed imaginable. One such booming technology is Blockchain. A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. And once entered, the information is immutable. Ongoing projects and prior work in the fields of big data, data mining and data science has revealed how relevant data can be used to enhance products and services. There are uncountable applications and advantages of relevant data. The most valuable companies of today treat data as a commodity, which they trade and earn revenues.
   But use of relevant data has also drawn attention by the other non-conventional organizations and domains. To facilitate such trading, data marketplaces have emerged. In this paper we present a global data marketplace for users to easily buy and share data. The main focus of this research is to have a central data sharing platform for the recycling industry. This paper is a part of the research project "Recycling 4.0" which is focusing on sustainably improving the recycling process through exchange of information. We identify providing secure platform, data integrity and data quality as some major challenges for a data marketplace. In this paper we also explore how global data marketplace could be implemented using blockchain and similar technologies.

TI A Survey on Blockchain: A Game Theoretical Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Over the past decade, blockchain technology has attracted tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The popularity of blockchains was originated from the concept of crypto-currencies to serve as a decentralized and tamper-proof transaction data ledger. Nowadays, blockchains as the key framework in the decentralized public data-ledger have been applied to a wide range of scenarios far beyond crypto-currencies, such as the Internet of Things, healthcare, and insurance. This survey aims to fill the gap between a large number of studies on blockchain networks, where game theory emerges as an analytical tool, and the lack of a comprehensive survey on the game theoretical approaches applied in blockchain-related issues. In this survey, we review the game models proposed to address common issues in the blockchain network. The focus is placed on security issues, e.g., selfish mining, majority attack and denial of service attack, issues regarding mining management, e.g., computational power allocation, reward allocation, and pool selection, as well as issues regarding blockchain economic and energy trading. Additionally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these selected game theoretical models and solutions. Finally, we highlight important challenges and future research directions of applying game theoretical approaches to incentive mechanism design and the combination of blockchain with other technologies.

AB Current new IoT standards do not detail enough some important and emergent aspects as the Fog/Edge computing support, the IoT computation topology management or the IoT visualization systems. This work defines three new concepts: a) the paradigm of edge/cloud computing transparency that lets the computation nodes change dynamically without administrator intervention; b) the IoT computing topology management that gives an IoT system global view, from the hardware and communication infrastructures to the software deployed on them, and c) the automation and integration of IoT visualization systems for real time data visualization, current IoT topology and current paths of data flows. It is also defined a new architectural model that includes these concepts and covers other IoT demands, like security safeguard services based on Blockchain. This architectural model definition is taken as the basis for developing a new advanced IoT platform referred as SAT-IoT.

TI An IOT-Oriented Privacy-Preserving Publish/Subscribe Model Over
   Blockchains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the Internet of Things (IoT), a cyber physical system (CPS) has achieved great success in a wide range of distributed integration environments. In the cyber physical system (CPS), interconnected sensing devices collect data in the surrounding environment and send data to all interested nodes through the network, thereby sharing all nodes data. This process can be implemented by using a publish/subscribe (pub/sub for short) system. Providing the basic security mechanisms such as authorization and confidentiality is a challenge due to the loose coupling of subscribers and publishers in such a pub/sub system. At the meanwhile, the existing IoT ecosystem mostly relies on a centralized server and thus faces the problem of single point failure. Thus, it is interesting to realize a brokerless or decentralized pub/sub model. Inspired by this motivation, this paper mainly proposes a privacy-preserving publish/subscribe model by using the blockchain technique, which evades the centralized trustroot setting and the problem of single point failure. Another key point of our proposal is that the primitive of public key encryption with equality test (PKEwET) is employed to enable all the required authorization, communication and topics matching can be finished in a confidential manner. Finally, a lightweight prototype of our proposal is implemented by using web3j, and the security and efficiency analysis are also presented.

AB Attacks on transactions of Ethereum could be dangerous because they could lead to a big loss of money. There are many tools detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts trying to avoid potential attacks. However, we found that there are still many missed vulnerabilities in contracts. Motivated by this, we propose a methodology to reinforce EVM to stop dangerous transactions in real time even when the smart contract contains vulnerabilities. Basically, the methodology consists of three steps: monitoring strategy definition, opcode-structure maintenance and EVM instrumentation. Monitoring strategy definition refers to the specific rule to test whether there is a dangerous operation during transaction execution. Opcode-structure maintenance is to maintain a structure to store the rule related opcodes and analyze it before an operation execution. EVM instrumentation inserts the monitoring strategy, interrupting mechanism and the opcode-structure operations in EVM source code. For evaluation, we implement EVM* on js-evm, a widely-used EVM platform written in javascript. We collect 10 contracts online with known bugs and use each contract to execute a dangerous transaction, all of them have been interrupted by our reinforced EVM*, while the original EVM permits all attack transactions. For the time overhead, the reinforced EVM* is slower than the original one by 20-30%, which is tolerable for the financial critical applications.

AB In this paper, we aim to address the major problem of correct image attribution for photos being uploaded on the stock photo websites and peer-to-peer image sharing marketplaces, ensuring that original photographers are rightfully recognized and credited for their works. There are now millions of royalty-free images being shared every week on stock photo websites. There is a major discontent among photographers and graphics designers who share images on such websites regarding a widespread malpractice where others try to take credit for and benefit from original author's work. This happens when someone other than the original author uploads the same image as one already shared on the marketplace or uses image processing methods such as rotation, cropping, gray scale conversion etc and then uploads this tampered image to avoid copyright violation detection. To counter such problems, we propose a decentralised peer-to-peer photo sharing marketplace built on top of Ethereum test chain and demonstrate how it is fair, trustworthy and practical. Our decentralised application leverages perceptual hashes and robust smart contracts of Ethereum to automatically detect and reject tampered images that are perceptually similar to images already present on the marketplace. Due to inherent properties of Blockchain, our marketplace has no central authority controlling it, no third party interference, no single point of failure, zero-censorship and preserves online user privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a practical solution for automatically detecting and rejecting perceptually similar images on a decentralised image sharing platform, thus protecting the copyrights of genuine image authors.

TI Proof-of-Stake Consensus Mechanisms for Future Blockchain Networks:
   Fundamentals, Applications and Opportunities
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The rapid development of blockchain technology and their numerous emerging applications has received huge attention in recent years. The distributed consensus mechanism is the backbone of a blockchain network. It plays a key role in ensuring the network's security, integrity, and performance. Most current blockchain networks have been deploying the proof-of-work consensus mechanisms, in which the consensus is reached through intensive mining processes. However, this mechanism has several limitations, e.g., energy inefficiency, delay, and vulnerable to security threats. To overcome these problems, a new consensus mechanism has been developed recently, namely proof of stake, which enables to achieve the consensus via proving the stake ownership. This mechanism is expected to become a cutting-edge technology for future blockchain networks. This paper is dedicated to investigating proof-of-stake mechanisms, from fundamental knowledge to advanced proof-of-stake-based protocols along with performance analysis, e.g., energy consumption, delay, and security, as well as their promising applications, particularly in the field of Internet of Vehicles. The formation of stake pools and their effects on the network stake distribution are also analyzed and simulated. The results show that the ratio between the block reward and the total network stake has a significant impact on the decentralization of the network. Technical challenges and potential solutions are also discussed.

TI Blockchain for Secure EHRs Sharing of Mobile Cloud Based E-Health
   Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the storage of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) on mobile cloud environments, where mobile devices are integrated with cloud computing to facilitate medical data exchanges among patients and healthcare providers. This advanced model enables healthcare services with low operational cost, high flexibility, and EHRs availability. However, this new paradigm also raises concerns about data privacy and network security for e-health systems. How to reliably share EHRs among mobile users while guaranteeing high-security levels in the mobile cloud is a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a novel EHRs sharing framework that combines blockchain and the decentralized interplanetary file system (IPFS) on a mobile cloud platform. Particularly, we design a trustworthy access control mechanism using smart contracts to achieve secure EHRs sharing among different patients and medical providers. We present a prototype implementation using Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing scenario on a mobile app with Amazon cloud computing. The empirical results show that our proposal provides an effective solution for reliable data exchanges on mobile clouds while preserving sensitive health information against potential threats. The system evaluation and security analysis also demonstrate the performance improvements in lightweight access control design, minimum network latency with high security and data privacy levels, compared to the existing data sharing models.

AB The smart city is aiming for an intelligent connected society beyond the concept of U-City with simple ICT. In particular, the rapid development of information and communications, such as 5G, and blockchain, has led to a paradigm shift to a new digital urban environment. As smart energy and smart transportation are integrated or interlocked, the technical and institutional arrangement should be preceded from the time of user authentication to provide reliability, transparency, and efficiency. For this purpose, this study aims to investigate the technical and institutional plans for the implementation of safe urban life utilizing blockchain technology. In order to apply smart city services using blockchain technology, it is necessary to fully agree and practice among various stakeholders such as public, business, academia, and civic groups. It is expected to be implemented as a people-centered smart city by gradually applying the block chain-based pilot service, which is made and participated together.

TI An Efficient Forensics Architecture in Software-Defined Networking-IoT
   Using Blockchain Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A Potential solution for solving forensic is the use of blockchain in software-defined networking (SDN). The blockchain is a distributed peer-to-peer network that can be utilized on SDN-based Internet of Things (IoT) environments for security provisioning. Hence, to meet some challenges in digital forensics such as data integrity, evidence deletion or alteration, blockchain is used. However, some problems such as poor attack detection and slow processing existed in previous works. To address these issues, an efficient forensics architecture is proposed in SDN-IoT that establishes the Chain of Custody (CoC) in blockchain technology. The proposed SDN-based IoT architecture is initiated with flow table rules on switches for the three different traffics Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In this work, overloaded switches migrate the packets to nearby switches to balance the packet flow. The packets disobeying flow rules will be discarded by switches. The blockchain-based distributed controller in this forensic architecture is designed to use the Linear Homomorphic Signature (LHS) algorithm for validating users. Each controller is fed with a classifier that uses the Neuro Multi-fuzzy to classify malicious packets based on packet features. The logs of events are used and stored on the blockchain in the proposed SDN-IoT architecture. We evaluated the performance of our forensic architecture and compared it to the existing model using various performance measures. Our evaluation results demonstrate performance improvement by reducing delay, response time and processing time, increasing throughput, accuracy, and security parameters.

TI EACMS: Emergency Access Control Management System for Personal Health
   Record Based on Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Personal health records (PHRs) are private and vital assets for every patient. There have been introduced many works on various aspects of managing and organizing the PHR so far. However, there is an uncertain remaining issue for the role of PHR in emergencies. In a traditional emergency access system, the patient cannot give consent to emergency staff for accessing his/her PHR. Moreover, there is no secured record management of patient's PHR, which reveals highly confidential personal information, such as what happened, when, and who has access to such information. This paper proposes an emergency access control management system (EACMS) based on permissioned blockchain hyperledger fabric and hyperledger composer. In the proposed system, we defined some rules using the smart contracts for emergency condition and time duration for the emergency access PHR data items that patient can assign some limitations for controlling the PHR permissions. We analyzed the performance of our proposed framework by implementing it through the hyperledger composer based on the response time, privacy, security, and accessibility. The experiments con firm that our framework provides better efficiency compared with the traditional emergency access system.

AB Internet of Things (IoT), Supply Chain monitoring, and other distributed applications rely on messaging protocols for data exchange. Contemporary IoT and enterprise deployments widely use the publish-subscribe messaging model because of its resource-efficiency. However, the systems with publish-subscribe messaging model employ a centralized architecture, wherein the data from all the publishers in the application network flows via a central broker to the subscribers. Such a centralized architecture makes the publish-subscribe messaging model susceptible to Byzantine failures. For example, it provides an opportunity for the organization that owns the broker to tamper with the data. In this work, we contribute Trinity, a novel distributed publish-subscribe broker with Byzantine fault-tolerance and blockchain-based immutability. Trinity distributes the data published to one of the brokers in the network to all the brokers in the network, and stores the data in an immutable ledger through the use of blockchain technology. Through the use of consensus protocols and distributed ledger technology, Trinity can guarantee ordering, fault-tolerance, persistence and immutability across trust boundaries.
   Our evaluation results show that Trinity consumes minimal resources. To the best of our knowledge, Trinity is the first framework that combines the components of the blockchain technology with the publish-subscribe messaging model. Furthermore, we plan to use Trinity in a real-world use case for increasing the transparency of racial profiling.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency proposed by a developer hided under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, and it is relied on a peer-to-peer payment system created as an open source software. It is relied on blockchain a distributed and democratically-sustained public register of the transactions. Bitcoin, as well as other digital currencies, has a lower transaction cost and greater security and scalability than fiat money and no need of a central bank. However, in the last years several researchers have relived environmental issues related to the use of this money. On the contrary, the relate technology of blockchain is recognizing as a significant tool contributing to create a more sustainable world. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to describe and evaluate the sustainability of the Bitcoin currency and the blockchain technology considering the environmental and social impacts due to energy consumption, market diffusion compared to fiat currency. Blockchain can reduce and accelerate bureaucracy processes as well as incentivize environmentally friendly behaviour. Under these perspectives, blockchain may show the full applicability of sustainability in the economic, environmental and social sectors.

AB Mining for cryptocurrencies is usually performed on high-performance single purpose hardware or GPUs. However, mining can be easily parallelized and distributed over many less powerful systems. Cryptojacking is a new threat on the Internet and describes code included in websites that uses a visitor's CPU to mine for cryptocurrencies without the their consent. This paper introduces MININGHUNTER, a novel web crawling framework which is able to detect mining scripts even if they obfuscate their malicious activities. We scanned the Alexa Top 1 million websites for cryptojacking, collected more than 13,400,000 unique JavaScript fi les with a total size of 246 GB and found that 3,178 websites perform cryptocurrency mining without their visitors' consent. Furthermore, MININGHUNTER can be used to provide an in-depth analysis of cryptojacking campaigns. To show the feasibility of the proposed framework, three of such campaigns are examined in detail. Our results provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of the spread of cryptojacking on the Internet.

TI Law and the Blockchain
SO IOWA LAW REVIEW
AB All contracts are necessarily incomplete. The inefficiencies of bargaining over every contingency, coupled with humans' innate bounded rationality, mean that contracts cannot anticipate and address every potential eventuality. One role of law is to fill gaps in incomplete contracts with default rules. Emerging technologies have created new, yet equally incomplete, types of contracts that exist outside of this traditional gap-filling legal role. The blockchain is a distributed ledger that allows the cryptographic recording of transactions and permits "smart" contracts that self-execute automatically if their conditions are met. Because humans code the contracts of the blockchain, gaps in these contracts will arise. Yet in the world of "smart contracting" on the blockchain, there is no place for the law to step in to supply default rules-no "legal intervention point." The lack of a legal intervention point means that law on the blockchain works in a fundamentally different way from law in the corporeal world. Business organizational law provides a prime example of how the law uses default rules to fill gaps in an incomplete contract and how the law works differently in the blockchain context.

The system is redundant and distributed, making it difficult for fraudulent transactions. Beyond digital currencies, the blockchain concept has already demonstrated its potential in the insurance, health, digital identity, and many other areas. In order to deal with specific needs in those areas, a new technology has appeared-smart contracts-computational code programmed to meet and enforce certain conditions, like the ones seen in traditional contracts. Taking into account the benefits brought by blockchain and smart contracts, it is important to study their contributions to emerging technological solutions, like IoT ( Internet of Things), in which security, connectivity and interoperability are major concerns. This paper aims to describe relevant blockchain and smart contract's concepts, discussing their contribution to support and improve modern IoT solutions.

TI Secure and Reliable Resource Allocation and Caching in

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Aerial-terrestrial cloud networks (ATCNs), global integration of air and ground communication systems, pave a way for a large set of applications such as surveillance, on-demand transmissions, data-acquisition, and navigation. However, such networks suffer from crucial challenges of secure and reliable resource allocation and content-caching as the involved entities are highly dynamic and there is no fine-tuned strategy to accommodate their connectivity. To resolve this quandary, cog-chain, a novel paradigm for secure and reliable resource allocation and content-caching in ATCNs, is presented. Various requirements, key concepts, and issues with ATCNs are also presented along with basic concepts to establish a cog-chain in ATCNs. Feed and fetch modes are utilized depending on the involved entities and caching servers. In addition, a cog-chain communication protocol is presented which avails to evaluate the formation of a virtual cog-chain between the nodes and the content-caching servers. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated through consequential gains observed for signaling overheads, computational time, reliability, and resource allocation growth. The proposed approach operates with the signaling overheads ranging between 30.36 and 303.6 bytes*hops/sec and the formation time between 186 and 195 ms. Furthermore, the overall time consumption is 83.33% lower than the sequential-verification model and the resource allocation growth is 27.17% better than the sequential-verification model.

TI Homomorphic Consortium Blockchain for Smart Home System Sensitive Data

AB The relative low level of smart home system (SHS) device information security may threaten the privacy of users. In this paper, we propose a homomorphic consortium blockchain for SHS sensitive data privacy preserving (HCB-SDPP), which is based on the traditional smart home system. We add verification services, which are composed of verification nodes, to our model to verify working nodes and transactions in SHS. In order to record the SHS device information transaction, we propose a new block data structure based on homomorphic encryption (HEBDS). Using the HCB-SDPP model, we design an encrypted algorithm based on Paillier encrypted for privacy protection. To verify the validity of the HCB-SDPP model, we firstly encrypt sensitive data of all gateway peers and upload them to the consortium blockchain. Then, we validate the security of sensitive data after homomorphic encryption processing. In the experiment, we also design attack experiments to attack different types of peers on the consortium blockchain in the HCB-SDPP model. If these nodes are insecure, the influence on the whole model will be analyzed. The simulation result shows that the HCB-SDPP model can protect customer privacy more effectively than SHS.

TI Regional Blockchain for Vehicular Networks to Prevent 51% Attacks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The next generation of vehicles will be autonomous, connected, electric, and intelligent with distinct requirements such as high mobility, low latency, real-time applications, seamless connectivity, and security. Blockchain can provide a good solution to the issue of secure message dissemination or secure information sharing in vehicular networks with a weak trust relationship among the nodes. In this paper, we investigate the design of a regional blockchain for VANETs, where the blockchain is shared among nodes in a geographically bounded area. We investigate how to design the regional blockchain while achieving a low 51% attack success probability. We derive a condition that guarantees a low 51% attack success probability in terms of the numbers of good nodes and malicious nodes, the message delivery time, and the puzzle computation time. The condition can provide a useful guideline for selection of several control parameters guaranteeing the stable operation of the blockchain. We run several simulations to show the validity of the condition and investigate the effects of various parameters on the 51% attack success probability. Our analysis and simulation results show that maintaining a low message delivery time for good nodes is very important in protecting the stability of the blockchain system.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a rapidly-growing transformative expansion of the Internet with increasing influence on our daily life. Since the number of "things" is expected to soon surpass human population, control and automation of IoT devices has received considerable attention from academia and industry. Cross-platform collaboration is highly desirable for better user experience due to fragmentation of user needs and vendor products with time. Centralized approaches have been used to build federated trust among platforms and devices, but limit diversity and scalability. We propose a decentralized trust framework, called IoT Passport, for cross-platform collaborations using blockchain technology. IoT Passport is motivated by the familiar use of passports for international travel but with greater dynamism. It enables platforms to establish arbitrary trust relations with each other containing specific rules for intended collaborations, enforced by a combination of smart contracts. Each interaction among devices is signed by the participants and recorded on the blockchain. The records are utilized as attributes for authorization and as proofs of incentive plans. This approach incorporates the preferences of participating platforms and end users, and opens new avenues for collaborative edge computing as well as research on blockchain-based access control mechanism for IoT environments.

TI An Efficient Authentication Scheme for Blockchain-Based Electronic
   Health Records
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In traditional electronic health records (EHRs), medical-related information is generally separately controlled by different hospitals and thus it leads to the inconvenience of information sharing. Cloud-based EHRs solve the problem of information sharing in the traditional EHRs. However, cloud-based EHRs suffer the centralized problem, i.e., cloud service center and key-generation center. This paper works on creating a new EHRs paradigm which can help in dealing with the centralized problem of cloud-based EHRs. Our solution is to make use of the emerging technology of blockchain to EHRs (denoted as blockchain-based EHRs for convenience). First, we formally define the system model of blockchain-based EHRs in the setting of consortium blockchain. In addition, the authentication issue is very important for EHRs. However, existing authentication schemes for blockchain-based EHRs have their own weak points. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose an authentication scheme for blockchain-based EHRs. Our proposal is an identity-based signature scheme with multiple authorities which can resist collusion attack out of N from N -1 authorities. Furthermore, our scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model and has more efficient signing and verification algorithms than existing authentication schemes of blockchain-based EHRs.

CL Honolulu, HI
AB TomoChain(1) is a blockchain based on Ethereum framework with the following advantages points: low transaction fee, fast confirmation time, double validation and randomization for security guarantees. In our previous technical white paper, we proposed Proof-of-Stake Voting (PoSV) consensus protocol, a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based blockchain protocol with a fair voting mechanism, rigorous security guarantees and fast finality. One of the key parts of PoSV is the double validation process, which requires randomization to generate the list of block verifiers (with uniform distribution and unpredictability) for each epoch. In other words, randomization of block verifiers in double validation is the key factor of reducing risks coming from paired hand-shaking attackers trying to commit malicious blocks.
   In this paper, we focus on studying methods for randomization of block verifiers. In particular, we study combinatorial and probability theory, and then apply the fixed-point-free permutation method for randomization. With this approach, we show that the contributions and benefits of verifiers are fair in the sense that the probability distribution function is uniform eventually. Finally, we implement the proposed protocol and conduct experiments on TomoChain public blockchain.

AB Crypto assets can be classified into two main categories, according to their principal function: native coins and crypto tokens. Native coins, like Bitcoin, generally compete with the traditional forms of money providing both an alternative currency instrument and a payment infrastructure. Differently from native coins, crypto tokens are coins that embed some intrinsic values somehow linked to the quality of the issuing entity's business model and to the ecosystem it generates. This chapter explores the emergent start-up token funding model of Initial Coin Offering, which allows entrepreneurs to bypass the traditional capital market by issuing crypto tokens directly to investors. The positive feedback loop between an issuer's business model and the token funding model will be demystified.

AB Blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt applications beyond cryptocurrencies. This work applies the concepts of blockchain technology to swarm robotics applications. Swarm robots typically operate in a distributed fashion, wherein the collaboration and coordination between the robots are essential to accomplishing the application goals. However, robot swarms may experience network partitions either due to navigational and communication challenges or in order to perform certain tasks efficiently. We propose a novel protocol, SwarmDAG, that enables the maintenance of a distributed ledger based on the concept of extended virtual synchrony while managing and tolerating network partitions.

AB The complexity of supply chains increase, especially due to the geographical spread of supplier and customer networks. In the connected and automated supply chains of the industry 4.0, even more nodes are incorporated in supply chains. This paper discusses the possible improvement of process quality in the industry 4.0 through the different blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. We derived hypotheses from a literature review and asked German blockchain experts from the industry to validate and discuss the hypotheses. We find that the different blockchain technologies and consensus algorithms have different strength with regard to quality improvement. One central finding is that IOTA, developed especially for the IoT and deemed the 'next evolutionary step' is scalable and hence may increases the process efficiency, but at the same time is more vulnerable than other blockchain implementations, which again may reduce the overall process quality.

AB Metering is a critical process in large-scale distributed industrial plants, which enables multiple plants to collaborate to offer mutual services without outside interference. When distributed plants measure the data from a shared common source, e. g., flow metering in an oil pipeline, trustworthiness and immutability must be guaranteed among them. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical and scalable blockchain-based secure metering system, SMChain, to provide strong security, trustworthy guarantee, and immutable services. SMChain adopts a two-layer blockchain structure, consisting of independent local blockchains stored at individual plants and one state blockchain stored in the cloud. To deal with the scalability issues within each plant, we propose a novel scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol based on (k, n)-threshold signature scheme to deal with the Byzantine faults and reduce the intra-plant communication complexity from O(n(2)) to O(n). For the state blockchain, we use a cloud-based service to synchronize and integrate the local blockchains into one state blockchain, which can further be distributed back to each plant.

AB In Ethereum, many accounts and funds have been managed by smart contracts, thereby making them easy to be targeted. Due to the persistence characteristic of blockchain, revising a deployed smart contract is almost impossible. Both realities heighten the risks of managing funds and thus increase the demand for conducting sufficient testing to Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESC). Different from the conventional software, ESC is a gas-driven program, where developers must charge gases for deploying and testing it. Therefore, it is important to provide a cost-effective yet representative test suite, where its representativeness can be typically measured by its branch coverage. In this paper, we deem the problem of ESC test generation as a Pareto minimization problem, and three objectives, minimizing (1) uncovered branch coverage, (2) time cost, and (3) gas cost are considered. Then, we propose a random based and an NSGA-II based multi-objective approach to seek cost-effective test-suites. Our empirical study on a set of smart contracts in eight of the most widely used Ethereum Decentralized Applications (DApps) verified that the proposed approaches could significantly reduce the gas cost as well as the time cost while retaining the ability to cover branches.

TI Pool Strategies Selection in PoW-Based Blockchain Networks:
   Game-Theoretic Analysis
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In proof-of-work-based (PoW-based) blockchain networks, the miners participate in a crypto-puzzle solving competition to win the reward by publishing a new block. Open mining pools attract a large number of miners for solving difficult problems together. Although the open strategy is likely to be more efficient, it makes pools susceptible to attack at the same time. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic analysis of mining pool strategy selection in order to explore the trade-off between the efficiency of openness and the vulnerability of attacks in a PoW-based blockchain network. We first model the pool mining process as a two-stage game, wherein the pools might decide whether to open or not and to attack or not. Based on the two-stage game model, we analyze the Nash equilibrium and the evolutionary stability of the mining games among pools, which uncovers the pool selection dynamics of PoW-based blockchain networks. In particular, we find that the attack behavior is the norm for a weak pool and triggers lower expected utilities when punishing the attacks more severely. Numerical simulations also support our theoretical findings as well as demonstrate the stability of the pools' strategy selection.

TI Study of Blockchains's Consensus Mechanism Based on Credit
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) is one of the most popular consensus protocols of the blockchain. However, in the PBFT, the enthusiasm of reliable nodes cannot be stimulated effectively, and a large amount of communication resources are used for data consistency. Therefore, a new consensus protocol-credit-delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (CDBFT)-is proposed in this paper. The CDBFT works as the following: 1) a voting rewards and punishments scheme and its corresponding credit evaluation scheme are proposed not only to stimulate enthusiasm of reliable nodes but also to reduce the participation of abnormal nodes in the consensus process, and the virtuous circle of the system can be founded and 2) consistency and checkpoint protocols based on PBFT are proposed to improve the efficiency and flexibility of system. From the simulation results, a conclusion can be drawn, the participation probability of abnormal nodes in the consensus process can be reduced to 5%, and the efficiency and stability of the system are improved greatly in the long-time running.

In general, the task matching process is required to be reliable and to meet privacy requirements. However, most existing privacy-preserving task matching solutions for crowdsourcing focus on privacy issues but ignore the reliability of the process. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based task matching scheme for crowdsourcing with a secure and reliable matching. Instead of utilizing a centralized cloud server, we employ smart contracts, an emerging blockchain technology, to provide reliable and transparent matching. In this way, data confidentiality and identity anonymity are achieved effectively and efficiently. The extensive privacy analysis and performance evaluation show that our solution is secure and feasible.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The modern intelligent transportation system brings not only new opportunities for vehicular Internet of Things (IoT) services but also new challenges for vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs). Apart from enhanced network performance, a practical and reliable security scheme is needed to handle the trust management while preserving user privacy at the same time. The emerging 5G mobile communication system is viewed as a prominent technology for ultra-reliable, low-latency wireless communication services. Furthermore, incorporating software-defined network (SDN) architecture into the 5G-VANET enables global information gathering and network control. Hence, real-time IoT services on transportation monitoring and reporting can be well supported. Both pave the way for an innovative vehicular security scheme. This paper investigates the security and privacy issue in the transportation system and the vehicular IoT environment in SDN-enabled 5G-VANET. Due to the decentralized and immutable characteristics of blockchain, a blockchain-based security framework is designed to support the vehicular IoT services, i.e., real-time cloud-based video report and trust management on vehicular messages. This paper explicitly illustrates the SDN-enabled 5G-VANET model and the scheduling procedures of the blockchain-based framework. The numerical simulation results also show that malicious vehicular nodes or messages can be well detected while the overhead and impact on the network performance are acceptable for large-scale scenarios. Through case studies and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate our design substantially guarantees a secure and trustworthy vehicular IoT environment with user privacy preserved.

AB Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology, and it is the technology underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The interest in blockchain has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages, e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these languages are already known to potential developers, and development tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that these languages were not originally designed for writing smart contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum. Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with our tool and evaluate the usefulness.

TI Basing Diversified Services of Complex IIoT Applications on Scalable
   Block Graph Platform
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In complex Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) application systems, there may exist a variety of functional sub-systems which provide divergent services to the users and the relationship among these services could be strong, which is evidently very common in practice. As one such IoT application, the smart city is designed to use intelligent services in an environment where transport, environment, energy, living, governance, and civic components are integrated to operate the city in a smart and efficient manner. Surprisingly, however, the current state-of-the-art on blockchain does not show the progress on diversified services of the complex IIoT applications. This paper tends to fill the gap and presents a scalable block graph platform and consensus protocol for the complex IIoT applications by adopting the limited resources of IIoT devices. The platform and consensus protocol are generic in the sense that they can support any practical service. The directed acyclic graph represents a significant exhibition in improving the scalability of blockchains and supports our proposed consensus protocol in substance; moreover, the detailed syntax of the block graph is defined. The consensus protocol is showed to be secure against disloyal voting, sybil attack, and 51% attack. The real use case of smart city demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposal.

Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive review to conceptualize the blockchain-based framework to develop the decentralized protocols for the extensive number of Internet services.

Additionally, we present a case study of the blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) for neuro-informatics to illustrate the potential applications of blockchain architectures. Finally, we summarize the trends and challenges of blockchain architectures that benefit a multitude of disciplines across all the Internet service fields of interest.

AB Recently, blockchain technology has been widely applied in the financial field. Therefore, the security of the blockchain smart contracts is among the most popular contemporary research topics. To improve the theorem-proving technology in this field, we are developing an extensible hybrid verification proof engine, denoted as FEther, for Ethereum smart contract verification. Based on Lolisa, which is a large subset of solidity mechanized in Coq, FEther guarantees the consistency between smart contracts and its formal model. Combining symbolic execution with higher order logic theorem-proving, FEther contains a set of automatic strategies that execute and verify the smart contracts in Coq with a high level of automation. Besides, in FEther, the verified code segments also can be reused to assist in the verification of other properties. The functional correctness of FEther was verified in Coq. The execution efficiency of FEther has far exceeded that of the interpreters that are developed in Coq in accordance with the standard tutorial. To the best of our knowledge, FEther is the first definitional interpreter of the solidity language in Coq.

AB With the development of the Internet of Vehicles, more and more applications require collaboration between vehicles. Vehicles from different car manufacturers have their own private clouds, and the collaboration between them is poor, resulting in inefficient collaboration between heterogeneous vehicles. A single cloud lacks collaboration between vehicles and it's an inevitable trend for developing collaboration between clouds. JointCloud is a new computing model in which collaboration services provided between clouds are used to server users in a software-defined manner based on blockchain. This paper proposes the collaboration framework of multiple vehicle clouds, introduces the blockchain to establish the coordination mechanism, and describes standardization method and service combination method of the vehicular cloud service in detail. At the end of this paper, we designed a distributed cloud service evaluation method based on blockchain to provide users with an effective cloud service evaluation solution.

TI Design and Implementation on Hyperledger-Based Emission Trading System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Emission trading policy provides a new approach using economic incentives to control the environmental pollution efficiently. Legal polluters can trade emission permits with each other through a trusted trading system that lacks security and credibility due to its centralization nowadays. Permissioned blockchain utilize a decentralized way to store private data immutably, providing new approaches to solve those defects of the existing centralized systems. In this paper, we propose a Hyperledger-based Emission Trading System (HyperETS) on the permissioned blockchain. Using Hyperledger Fabric as the implementation platform, HyperETS integrates the fine-grained access control, distributed ledger, and consensus protocol, aiming to provide credible trading service for polluters. We achieve the business logic by designing the particular ledger structures and smart contract in blockchain. HyperETS stores all transactions immutably in a chain and makes it easy to share the data between organizations. Finally, several experiments are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed demonstration system.

TI BitExTract: Interactive Visualization for Extracting Bitcoin Exchange
   Intelligence
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
AB The emerging prosperity of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, has come into the spotlight during the past few years. Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular. BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted much attention due to the great success of the cryptocurrencies. Owing to its immutability property and consensus protocol, blockchain offers a new solution for trusted storage and computation services. To scale up the services, prior research has suggested a hybrid storage architecture, where only small meta-data are stored on chain and the raw data are outsourced to off-chain storage. To protect data integrity, a cryptographic proof can be constructed online for queries over the data stored in the system. However, the previous schemes only support simple key-value queries. In this paper, we take the first step toward studying authenticated range queries in the hybrid-storage blockchain. The key challenge lies in how to design an authenticated data structure (ADS) that can be efficiently maintained by the blockchain, in which a unique gas cost model is employed. By analyzing the performance of the existing techniques, we propose a novel ADS, called GEM(2)-tree, which is not only gas-efficient but also effective in supporting authenticated queries. To further reduce the ADS maintenance cost without sacrificing much the query performance, we also propose an optimized structure, GEM(2)*-tree, by designing a two-level index structure. Theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation validate the performance of the proposed ADSs.

TI Data Security Sharing and Storage Based on a Consortium Blockchain in a
   Vehicular Ad-hoc Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) can improve the flow of traffic to facilitate intelligent transportation and to provide convenient information services, where the goal is to provide self-organizing data transmission capabilities for vehicles on the road to enable applications, such as assisted vehicle driving and safety warnings. VANETs are affected by issues such as identity validity and message reliability when vehicle nodes share data with other nodes. The method used to allow the vehicle nodes to upload sensor data to a trusted center for storage is susceptible to security risks, such as malicious tampering and data leakage. To address these security challenges, we propose a data security sharing and storage system based on the consortium blockchain (DSSCB). This digital signature technique based on the nature of bilinear pairing for elliptic curves is used to ensure the reliability and integrity when transmitting data to a node. The emerging consortium blockchain technology provides a decentralized, secure, and reliable database, which is maintained by the entire network node. In DSSCB, smart contracts are used to limit the triggering conditions for preselected nodes when transmitting and storing data and for allocating data coins to vehicles that participate in the contribution of data. The security analysis and performance evaluations demonstrated that our DSSCB solution is more secure and reliable in terms of data sharing and storage. Compared with the traditional blockchain system, the time required to confirm the data block was reduced by nearly six times and the transmission efficiency was improved by 83.33%.

AB In unmanned collaborative cognition scenarios, traditional IoT systems are facing with data security and node privacy problems. However, blockchain together with data encryption technique enables the trustless network due to the tamper-proof, anonymity and unbreakable properties. Nevertheless, there are still some shortages when combining blockchain with IoT systems, for example the storage consumption. Generally speaking, validation nodes in blockchain network need to store a complete copy of the ledger so as to verify transactions and reach the whole network consensus. However, in unmanned collaborative cognition scenarios, many devices' storage capacity are limited. Therefore, in order to solve the storage problem, we propose LS4BUCC, a low overhead storage architecture regarding to the new features of unmanned collaborative cognition systems. It selectively stores data according to the value density. Based on three storage mechanisms and two supportive methods, LS4BUCC can reduce the data storage and maintain the system security and efficiency at the same time.

TI MoSa: A Modeling and Sentiment Analysis System for Mobile Application
   Big Data
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB The development of mobile internet has led to a massive amount of data being generated from mobile devices daily, which has become a source for analyzing human behavior and trends in public sentiment. In this paper, we build a system called MoSa (Mobile Sentiment analysis) to analyze this data. In this system, sentiment analysis is used to analyze news comments on the THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) event from Toutiao by employing algorithms to calculate the sentiment value of the comment. This paper is based on HowNet; after the comparison of different sentiment dictionaries, we discover that the method proposed in this paper, which use a mixed sentiment dictionary, has a higher accuracy rate in its analysis of comment sentiment tendency. We then statistically analyze the relevant attributes of the comments and their sentiment values and discover that the standard deviation of the comments' sentiment value can quickly reflect sentiment changes among the public. Besides that, we also derive some special models from the data that can reflect some specific characteristics. We find that the intrinsic characteristics of situational awareness have implicit symmetry. By using our system, people can obtain some practical results to guide interaction design in applications including mobile Internet, social networks, and blockchain based crowdsourcing.

TI bcBIM: A Blockchain-Based Big Data Model for BIM Modification Audit and
   Provenance in Mobile Cloud
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB Building Information Modeling (BIM) is envisioned as an indispensable opportunity in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries as a revolutionary technology and process. Smart construction relies on BIM for manipulating information flow, data flow, and management flow. Currently, BIM model has been explored mainly for information construction and utilization, but rare works pay efforts to information security, e.g., critical model audit and sensitive model exposure. Moreover, few BIM systems are proposed to chase after upcoming computing paradigms, such as mobile cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and Internet of Things. In this paper, we make the first attempt to propose a novel BIM system model called bcBIM to tackle information security in mobile cloud architectures. More specifically, bcBIM is proposed to facilitate BIM data audit for historical modifications by blockchain in mobile cloud with big data sharing. The proposed bcBIM model can guide the architecture design for further BIM information management system, especially for integrating BIM cloud as a service for further big data sharing. We propose a method of BIM data organization based on blockchains and discuss it based on private and public blockchain. It guarantees to trace, authenticate, and prevent tampering with BIM historical data. At the same time, it can generate a unified format to support future open sharing, data audit, and data provenance.

AB Traditional cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA) suffers from lacking a trustworthy platform for automatic enforcement. The emerging blockchain technique brings in an immutable solution for tracking transactions among business partners. However, it is still very challenging to prove the credibility of possible violations in the SLA before recording them onto the blockchain. To tackle this challenge, we propose a witness model using game theory and the smart contract techniques. The proposed model extends the existing service model with a new role called "witness" for detecting and reporting service violations. Witnesses gain revenue as an incentive for performing these duties, and the payoff function is carefully designed in a way that trustworthiness is guaranteed: in order to get the maximum profit, the witness has to always tell the truth. This is analyzed and proved through game theory using the Nash equilibrium principle. In addition, an unbiased sortition algorithm is proposed to ensure the randomness of the independent witnesses selection from the decentralized witness pool, to avoid possible unfairness or collusion. An auditing mechanism is also introduced in the paper to detect potential irrational or malicious witnesses. We have prototyped the system leveraging the smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model and indicate good performance in accordance with the design expectations.

TI DLattice: A Permission-Less Blockchain Based on DPoS-BA-DAG Consensus
   for Data Tokenization
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In today's digital information age, the conflict between the public's growing awareness of their own data protection and the data owners' inability to obtain data ownership has become increasingly prominent. The emergence of blockchain provides a new direction for data protection and data tokenization. Nonetheless, existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin using Proof-of-Work are particularly energy intensive. On the other hand, classical protocols such as Byzantine agreement do not work efficiently in an open environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a permission-less blockchain with a novel double-DAG (directed acyclic graph) architecture called DLattice, where each account has its own Account-DAG and all accounts make up a greater Node-DAG structure. DLattice parallelizes the growth of each account's Account-DAG, each of which is not influenced by other accounts' irrelevant transactions. DLattice uses a new DPoS-BA-DAG(PANDA) protocol to reach consensus among users only when the forks are observed. Based on proposed DLattice, we introduce a process of data tokenization, including data assembling, data anchoring, and data authorization. We implement DLattice and evaluate its performance on 25 ECS virtual machines, simulating up to 500 nodes. The experimental results show that DLattice reaches a consensus in 10 seconds, achieves desired throughput, and incurs almost no penalty for scaling to more users.

AB Blockchain has been adopted in many applications to construct trust among multiple participants, such as supply chain management, digital assets transfer, philanthropy, etc. Blockchain platforms are often used as decentralized databases. However, existing blockchain platforms are far less convenient to use than traditional databases. They are lack of the capability of modelling complex tasks conveniently and efficiently, especially when both on -chain and off -chain data are involved at the same time. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel blockehain database, called SEBDB, which leverages the existing databases' functionality which are optimized 14 decades. Comparing to existing works, SEIMB is the first platform which considers both useability and scalability. Specifically, first, we add relational data semantics into blockchain platform, where each transaction is a tuple with multiple attributes in a pre -defined table. Second, we use SQL -like language as the general interface, instead of code -level APIs, to support convenient application development, in which intrinsic operations are re -defined and re -implemented to suit for blockchain platform. Third, as RDBMS has achieved great success in the past decades, our system, though not relying on RDBMS, treats it as an important component. Finally, we define a mini -benchmark to evaluate the performance of the blockchain database. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed system.

ICOs are a tool for startups in the blockchain ecosystem to raise early capital with relative ease. The market for ICOs has grown at a rapid pace since its start in 2013. We analyze a unique dataset of 278 projects that finished their ICOs by August 2017 to assess determinants of funding success that we derive from the crowdfunding and venture capital literature. Our results show that ICOs exhibit similarities to classical crowdfunding and venture capital markets. Specifically, we identify resemblances in determinants of funding success regarding human capital characteristics, business model quality, project elaboration, and social media activity.

AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin rely on a proof-of-work system to validate transactions and prevent attacks or double-spending. A new proof-of-work is introduced which seems to be the first number theoretic proof-of-work unrelated to primes: it is based on a new metric associated to the Collatz algorithm whose natural generalization is algorithmically undecidable: the inflation propensity is defined as the cardinality of new maxima in a developing Collatz orbit. It is numerically verified that the distribution of inflation propensity slowly converges to a geometric distribution of parameter 0.714 approximate to (pi-1)/3 as the sample size increases. This pseudo-randomness opens the door to a new class of proofs-of-work based on congruential graphs.

   effect
SO JOURNAL OF ASSET MANAGEMENT
AB We examine diversification benefits of several cryptocurrencies between 11 August 2015 and 7 August 2018 using mean-variance spanning tests. Among the eight cryptocurrencies under study, we find that all single cryptocurrencies besides one as well as a combination thereof yield significant diversification benefits when being added to a well-diversified benchmark portfolio. However, the improvement solely stems from an increase in portfolio returns, not a reduction of risk. Along with that distinction, we find that the overall beneficial impact of cryptocurrencies only holds for bullish market phases throughout our observation period, but vanishes completely throughout the price collapse of cryptocurrencies in 2018. Furthermore, we model daily differences in the returns and volatility of cryptocurrencies with an EGARCH model. Throughout the observation period considered, returns of all eight cryptocurrencies on Sundays are significantly lower than those on other days. A similar but less distinctive pattern is also observable for their conditional variance. One possible reason for the negative Sunday effect is the lower trading volume observed on Sundays, in connection with the assumption of a causal relationship between trading volume and asset returns and volatility as suggested by the mixture of distributions hypothesis.

TI DOUBLE SPEND RACES
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED FINANCE
AB We correct the double spend race analysis given in Nakamoto's foundational Bitcoin article and find the exact closed-form formula for the probability of success of a double spend attack using the regularized incomplete beta function. We give the first proof of its exponential decay on the number of confirmations, often cited in the literature, and find an asymptotic formula. Larger number of confirmations are required compared to those given by Nakamoto. We also compute this probability conditional to the knowledge of the time of the confirmations. This provides a finer risk analysis than the classical one.

   timestamping
SO IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Currently, timestamps are certified by central timestamping authorities, which have disadvantages of centralization. The concept of the decentralized trusted timestamping (DTT) was developed by Gipp et al. to address these drawbacks. The paper provides insights into the architecture and implementation of a decentralized timestamp service taking the integration of multiple blockchain types into account. Furthermore, the components are introduced and the versatile application scenarios are presented. A future direction of research is the evaluation of blockchain technology and their suitability for timestamping.

TI Laboratory information system and necessary improvements in function and
   programming
SO JOURNAL OF LABORATORY MEDICINE
AB Since the 1970s, computer supported data processing has been implemented in the laboratory and laboratory information systems (LIS) are being developed. In the following years, the programs were expanded and new laboratory requirements were inserted to the LIS. In the last few years, the requirements have grown more and more. The current tasks of the LIS are not only the management of laboratory requirements but also management of processes, data security and data transfer and they have become very important. Therefore, the current monolithic architecture of LIS has reached its limits. New methodologies like service oriented architecture, e.g. microservices, should be implemented. Thereby different specialized manufacturers provide software for one or a few tasks. These tasks can be more easily actualized like in the new field of agile software development. This new concept has been designed to provide updates and customer requirements according to its new organization structure in program development in a short time. For efficient data transfer, new interfaces and a standardization of master data like logical observation identifier names and codes (LOINC (R)) are advisable. With the growing data transfer, data security plays an increasingly important role. New concepts like blockchain programming (e.g. Medrec) are currently tested in (laboratory) medicine. To get an overview of the requirements of the own LIS, an Ishikawa diagram should be created. The main points of an Ishikawa diagram are shown and discussed. Based on the today-collected data, expert systems will be developed. For this kind of data mining, a structured data exchange is necessary.

TI Cryptocurrencies and Digital Fiat Currencies
SO AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Current generations of cryptocurrencies are not money, but future ones may be. While Bitcoin performs poorly as a store of value, it is actually on par with the Venezuelan bolivar over the last decade, and the Argentinian peso over the decade from 1986. I evaluate arguments in favour of central banks issuing digital fiat currency-intended to replace cash-and digital fiat money-intended to replace money more broadly. Digital fiat currency appears a natural step forward, but digital fiat money would be a bad idea as it makes the central bank responsible for the entire money supply.

TI Blockchain for digital rights management
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Online digital content service becomes more and more easily, however, free consumption and excessive spreading without rights protection will hurt the content providers' benefits and causes business loss, another problem is once the content provider supply illegal or politically sensitive content such as terroristic opinion or multimedia content, it will cause serious social problem such as fright or social crisis. To solve this problem, in this paper we proposed a blockchain-based scheme for digital rights management(named DRMChain), which supports the right content serves the right users in a right way, the DRMChain can provide trusted and high-level credible content protection and conditional traceability of violation content service. In the proposed DRMChain, we use two isolated blockchain application interfaces (BAI) to respectively store plain and cipher summary information of original and DRM-protected digital content, and considering large capacity of digital content such as image, audio or video, we proposed external flexible storage of plain/cipher digital content and creates hashlD of the content itself and links with the blockchain. In DRMChain scheme, we named the BAI plain interface as BAIP for summary metadata storage of original content, and the BAI cipher interface as BAIC for DRMprotected content service. In the DRMChain scheme we proposed efficient and secure authentication, privacy protection and multi-signature-based conditional traceability approaches, and thus the DRM license, usage control and constrain information can be easily retrieved form the blockchain, and customs can query all the consumption transaction lists of free or paid consumption history to prevent baleful fee-deduction. Analysis and performance evaluation manifest the DRMChain scheme provides a reliable, secure, efficient and tamper-resistance digital content service and DRM practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

SO AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB This article analyses ongoing changes in the supply of alternative media of payments (MOPs). The comparison between old (cash and deposits) and new (cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies) MOPs is based on a novel definition of money where a MOP has three properties: the first two are the standard functions of medium of exchange (liquidity costs) and store of value (opportunity costs) and the third is the novel function of store of information (privacy costs). Given such properties and that the evolution of the different MOPs likely depends on individual preferences, the relevance of experimental economics is highlighted.

SO AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB We investigate connectedness within and across two major groups or assets: i) five popular cryptocurrencies and ii) six major asset classes plus two commonly employed risk factors. Granger causality tests uncover six direct channels of causality from the elements of the mainstream assets/risk factors group to digital assets. There are also two statistically significant causal links going in the other direction. In order to provide some perspective on the magnitude of these linkages we estimate networks from forecast error variance decompositions. The estimated connectedness within the groups is relatively large, whereas the linkages across the two groups are small in comparison.

TI Chained Anomaly Detection Models for Federated Learning: An Intrusion
   Detection Case Study
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The adoption of machine learning and deep learning is on the rise in the cybersecurity domain where these AI methods help strengthen traditional system monitoring and threat detection solutions. However, adversaries too are becoming more effective in concealing malicious behavior amongst large amounts of benign behavior data. To address the increasing time-to-detection of these stealthy attacks, interconnected and federated learning systems can improve the detection of malicious behavior by joining forces and pooling together monitoring data. The major challenge that we address in this work is that in a federated learning setup, an adversary has many more opportunities to poison one of the local machine learning models with malicious training samples, thereby influencing the outcome of the federated learning and evading detection. We present a solution where contributing parties in federated learning can be held accountable and have their model updates audited. We describe a permissioned blockchain-based federated learning method where incremental updates to an anomaly detection machine learning model are chained together on the distributed ledger. By integrating federated learning with blockchain technology, our solution supports the auditing of machine learning models without the necessity to centralize the training data. Experiments with a realistic intrusion detection use case and an autoencoder for anomaly detection illustrate that the increased complexity caused by blockchain technology has a limited performance impact on the federated learning, varying between 5 and 15%, while providing full transparency over the distributed training process of the neural network. Furthermore, our blockchain-based federated learning solution can be generalized and applied to more sophisticated neural network architectures and other use cases.

TI Message exchange on base of a blockchain-based layered architecture
SO IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In this article, we propose an architecture that allows to exchange messages or data via a blockchain solution, while keeping the business process independent from the concrete blockchain. The project is the consequence of a need to have fast development of a blockchain based proof of concept that shows the feasibility of a business process, while knowing that in a future step the underlying blockchain solution has to be replaced for reasons of licensing or maximal data throughput. This is done by providing an architecture on base of layers, similar to the OSI-model, and encapsulates the used blockchain within a wrapper layer that covers all blockchain specific properties and only provides a transparent view on the reading or writing from and to the blockchain. The higher layers reimplement point-to-point communication and introduce confidentiality by the use of encryption techniques. The architecture has been tested and proven by implementing two different blockchain solutions that are shielded by specific wrapper layer implementations. This wrapper layer is responsible for the fragmentation of the sent data and their encapsulation into the concrete blockchain solution. The reconstruction of the data takes care of the data fragments being sent potentially out of order or being incomplete. A payload layer is introduced to provide pointto-point communication and to embed the main message inside a message structure. In collaboration with underlying layer it identifies for which message one is not the addressee and allow the underling layer to stop collecting unnecessary data. A crypto-layer finally provides ways of encrypting messages for one or many recipients. Having fixed layers not only allows to replace the underlying blockchain solution but also to extend or replace the other layers in case new security features or optimized protocols need to embedded. The proposed solution does not allow to use specific features like smart contracts and only provides undeniable tamper-proofed existence of a sent message.

TI Can social news websites pay for content and curation? The SteemIt
   cryptocurrency model
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE
AB SteemIt is a Reddit-like social news site that pays members for posting and curating content. It uses micropayments backed by a tradeable currency, exploiting the Bitcoin cryptocurrency generation model to finance content provision in conjunction with advertising. If successful, this paradigm might change the way in which volunteer-based sites operate. This article investigates 925,092 new members' first posts for insights into what drives financial success in the site. Initial blog posts on average received US$0.01, although the maximum accrued was US$20,680.83. Longer, more sentiment-rich or more positive comments with personal information received the greatest financial reward in contrast to more informational or topical content. Thus, there is a clear financial value in starting with a friendly introduction rather than immediately attempting to provide useful content, despite the latter being the ultimate site goal. Follow-up posts also tended to be more successful when more personal, suggesting that interpersonal communication rather than quality content provision has driven the site so far. It remains to be seen whether the model of small typical rewards and the possibility that a post might generate substantially more are enough to incentivise long-term participation or a greater focus on informational posts in the long term.

TI How to build time-lock encryption
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB Time-lock encryption is a method to encrypt a message such that it can only be decrypted after a certain deadline has passed. We propose a novel time-lock encryption scheme, whose main advantage over prior constructions is that even receivers with relatively weak computational resources should immediately be able to decrypt after the deadline, without any interaction with the sender, other receivers, or a trusted third party. We build our time-lock encryption on top of the new concept of computational reference clocks and an extractable witness encryption scheme. We explain how to construct a computational reference clock based on Bitcoin. We show how to achieve constant level of multilinearity for witness encryption by using SNARKs. We propose a new construction of a witness encryption scheme which is of independent interest: our scheme, based on SUBSET-SUM, achieves extractable security without relying on obfuscation. The scheme employs multilinear maps of arbitrary order and is independent of the implementations of multilinear maps.

TI How Blockchain Can Shape Sustainable Global Value Chains: An Evidence,
   Verifiability, and Enforceability (EVE) Framework
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Law, regulation, and private standards have evolved to enhance sustainability in value chains. However, the volume of hard and soft laws has created complexity and fragmentation for consumers and firms. In addition, global value chains are increasingly disaggregated, making it difficult for consumers to enforce breaches of sustainability representations. Blockchain, as an immutable and digital record keeping system, is a tool that can deal with this growing complexity in global value chains. Documents verifying sustainability that were once in the private domain and stored in paper copy can now be made accessible in a secure and transparent blockchain platform. Despite a growing interest in the potential of blockchain to transform businesses, there are few concrete examples or scholarly literature showing how blockchain is operationalized in practice. Using a "conceptual framework analysis" approach, we develop an Evidence, Verifiability, and Enforceability (EVE) framework to illustrate how blockchain can enhance sustainability by providing information to consumers on the origin of products, assurances as to the veracity of the information, and a mechanism to enforce representations through the blockchain smart contract function. However, there need to be safeguards put in place for blockchain technology to meet its promise and we discuss some of these challenges.

TI The troubled journey of QoS: From ATM to content networking, edge
   computing and distributed internet governance
SO COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
AB Network Quality of Service (QoS) and the associated user Quality of Experience (QoE) have always been the networking "holy grail" and have been sought after through various different approaches and networking technologies over the last decades. Despite substantial amounts of effort invested in the area, there has been very little actual deployment of mechanisms to guarantee QoS in the Internet. As a result, the Internet is largely operating on a "best effort" basis in terms of QoS. Here, we attempt a historical overview in order to better understand how we got to the point where we are today and consider the evolution of QoS/QoE in the future.
   As we move towards more demanding networking environments where enormous amounts of data is produced at the edge of the network (e.g., from IoT devices), computation will also need to migrate to the edge in order to guarantee QoS. In turn, we argue that distributed computing at the edge of the network will inevitably require infrastructure decentralisation. That said, trust to the infrastructure provider is more difficult to guarantee and new components need to be incorporated into the Internet landscape in order to be able to support emerging applications, but also achieve acceptable service quality.
   We start from the first steps of ATM and related IP-based technologies, we consider recent proposals for content-oriented and Information-Centric Networking, mobile edge and fog computing, and finally we see how distributed Internet governance through Distributed Ledger Technology and blockchains can influence QoS in future networks.

SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
AB With the development of Internet technology, transmitting, editing and misusing the digital multimedia bring great challenges in misusing detection for multimedia content protection. In this paper we proposed an artwork image digital rights management scheme for Internet misusing detection based on watermark and blockchain with robustness and high-level security. We embed artwork right information such as author, RightHolder, Date and Location information into the artwork image data. In the scheme, we use image Arnold transform to enhance the security and use image DCT coefficients of middle frequency to embed watermark for robustness. In the transparence of watermark, HVS and Watson models are used to control the watermark strength, which can enhance the invisibility. Once the suspicious image data from Internet are misused and spreading the image data on Internet without authorization, especially the high value artwork image data, we can trace the misuse responsibility by extracting the watermark. And according to the above algorithm, we implemented the scheme as DRMChain based on the consortium blockchain which stored the artwork and DRM information in an un-tampered ledger for decentralized rights confirmation. Large amount of experiments indicate the proposed watermark-based trusted blockchain DRM scheme is secure, robust, and for the protection and misuse detection of image data.

TI Dual antiplatelet therapy pretreatment in IV thrombolysis for acute
   ischemic stroke
SO NEUROLOGY
AB Objective
   We sought to determine the safety and efficacy of IV thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with a history of dual antiplatelet therapy pretreatment (DAPP) in a prospective multicenter study.
   Methods
   We compared the following outcomes between DAPP+and DAPP-IVT-treated patients before and after propensity score matching (PSM): symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1), and 3-month mortality.
   Results
   Among 790 IVT patients, 58 (7%) were on DAPP before stroke (mean age 68 +/- 13 years; 57% men; median NIH Stroke Scale score 8). DAPP+patients were older with more risk factors compared to DAPP-patients. The rates of sICH were similar between groups (3.4% vs 3.2%). In multivariable analyses adjusting for potential confounders, DAPP was associated with higher odds of asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (odds ratio = 3.53, 95% confidence interval: 1.47-8.47; p = 0.005) but also with a higher likelihood of 3-month favorable functional outcome (odds ratio = 2.41, 95% confidence interval: 1.06-5.46; p = 0.035). After propensity score matching, 41 DAPP+patients were matched to 82 DAPP-patients. The 2 groups did not differ in any of the baseline characteristics or safety and efficacy outcomes.
   Conclusions
   DAPP is not associated with higher rates of sICH and 3-month mortality following IVT. DAPP should not be used as a reason to withhold IVT in otherwise eligible AIS candidates.
   Classification of evidence
   This study provides Class III evidence that for IVT-treated patients with AIS, DAPP is not associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH. The study lacked the precision to exclude a potentially meaningful increase in sICH bleeding risk.

TI Blockchain inefficiency in the Bitcoin peers network
SO EPJ DATA SCIENCE
AB We investigate Bitcoin network observing transactions broadcasted into the network during a week from 04/05/2016 and then monitoring their inclusion into the blockchain during the following seven months. We unveil that 42% of the transactions are still not included in the Blockchain after 1 h from their appearance and 20% of the transactions are still not included in the Blockchain after 30 days, therefore revealing a great inefficiency in the Bitcoin system. However, we observe that most of these "forgotten" transactions have low values and in terms of transferred value the system is less inefficient with 93% of the transactions value being included into the Blockchain within 3 h and 98.8% within a day. The fact that a sizeable fraction of transactions is not processed timely casts serious doubts on the usability of the Bitcoin Blockchain for reliable time-stamping purposes. It also calls for a debate about the right systems of incentives which a peer-to-peer unintermediated system should introduce to promote efficient transaction recording

TI The CLoTH Simulator for HTLC Payment Networks with Introductory
   Lightning Network Performance Results
SO INFORMATION
AB The Lightning Network (LN) is one of the most promising off-chain scaling solutions for Bitcoin, as it enables off-chain payments which are not subject to the well-known blockchain scalability limit. In this work, we introduce CLoTH, a simulator for HTLC payment networks (of which LN is the best working example). It simulates input-defined payments on an input-defined HTLC network and produces performance measures in terms of payment-related statistics (such as time to complete payments and probability of payment failure). CLoTH helps to predict issues and obstacles that might emerge in the development stages of an HTLC payment network and to estimate the effects of an optimisation action before deploying it. We conducted simulations on a recent snapshot of the HTLC payment network of LN. These simulations allowed us to identify network and payments configurations for which a payment is more likely to fail than to succeed. We proposed viable solutions to avoid such configurations.

TI The Regulation of Initial Coin Offerings in China: Problems, Prognoses
   and Prospects
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB As a new form of the FinTech industry, initial coin offerings (ICOs) underwent a period of explosive growth in China since the second half of 2016 and were banned in September 2017. However, the outright ban on ICOs may hamper revolutionary technological developments and dampen the growth of this potentially beneficial market. In quest of a solution to meet the regulatory challenges rather than completely stifling the innovation, a comparative analysis has been conducted in some advanced economies, including the US, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the UK and the EU in order to propose a regulatory framework for ICOs in China. After a thorough analysis of relevant experiences and regulatory measures in overseas jurisdictions, this paper provides a non-exhaustive classification of the legal status of ICOs, namely pre-sale of products or services, offering of shares, issue of debentures, issue of derivatives, collective investment schemes and crowdfunding, as well as a possible regulatory reform of the current ICO ban in China. It is then concluded that except for ICOs that can be regarded as pre-sale of products or services, the other five types of ICOs are highly likely to be considered as financial securities and thus should be subject to securities laws.

TI WHAT PROBLEMS WILL YOU SOLVE WITH BLOCKCHAIN?
SO MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Distributed ledger technologies collectively known as blockchain have burst onto the business scene, accompanied by a significant amount of hype. Some of the excitement may indeed be warranted, the authors say, but only if organizations focus on how these technologies can be used to support their strategy.
   Businesses can use blockchain to gain an edge over rivals in a number of ways. It can be a foundation for applications that streamline core operations, lower transaction costs, and make intellectual property ownership and payments more transparent and automated. However, the authors advise against jumping on the bandwagon until firms understand what specific problems they can solve with blockchain and for whom. For example, how will it help them reach new customers? How can it improve efficiency or transparency in their supply chains? And most important, what will blockchain enable them to do that competitors and new entrants can't do?
   Companies can begin reaping benefits when they understand what the technologies are capable of doing and then systematically configure blockchains in ways that align with their unique strategy, their existing capabilities, and the problems they can solve.

TI Finding attractive technical patterns in cryptocurrency markets
SO MEMETIC COMPUTING
AB The cryptographic currency market is an emerging venue for traders looking to diversify their investments. We investigate the use of genetic programming (GP) for finding attractive technical patterns in a cryptocurrency market. We decompose the problem of automatic trading into two parts, mining useful signals and applying them to trading strategies, and focus our attention on the former. Extensive experiments are performed to analyze the factors that affect the quality of the solutions found by the proposed GP system. With the introduction of domain knowledge through extended function sets and the inclusion of diversity preserving mechanism, we show that the proposed GP system successfully finds attractive technical patterns. Out-of-sample performance of the patterns indicates that the GP consistently finds signals that are profitable and frequent. A trading simulation with the generated patterns suggests that the captured signals are indeed useful for portfolio optimization.

The methodologies used for the analysis are the so-called Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and hierarchical analysis by dendrogram, both obtained from Pearson correlations between daily returns. This methodology visualizes the market relationships between the assets analyzed, identifying a high correlation between price movements for all the currencies. In addition, it has been possible to identify Ethereum's position as a benchmark currency in the cryptocurrency market, rather than Bitcoin, as one might expect, due to its popularity and trading volume.

TI Modelling volatility persistence under stochasticity assumptions:
   evidence from common and alternative investments
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB Long-range memory estimation is a functional statistical mechanics technique to assess predictability in time series. In our work, we scrutinize the long-range dependence structure of volatility in a plethora of alternative and common investments via the use of a fractionally integrated conditional heteroscedastic model. Particularly, we evaluate the fractional persistence parameter of the temporal dynamics for the volatility series of Islamic, socially responsible and common investment indices related to the world major international stock markets. Long-range memory in volatility is measured under different types of market randomness, namely distributional specifications wherein the stochastic error components follow Normal and non-Normal densities. Our empirical results show strong evidence of long-range dependence in the volatility of alternative and common investments under all stochasticity assumptions. Furthermore, we show that the randomness profile has no effect upon the variability of long-range memory. We indicate differences in the statistical significance of the long-range memory across the investigated markets as well as in the degree of persistence. Our findings yield serious implications in terms of quantitative portfolio management and optimization. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI BAQALC: Blockchain Applied Lossless Efficient Transmission of DNA
   Sequencing Data for Next Generation Medical Informatics
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Due to the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology, genome-sequencing costs have been significantly reduced, which has led to a number of revolutionary advances in the genetics industry. However, the problem is that compared to the decrease in time and cost needed for DNA sequencing, the management of such large volumes of data is still an issue. Therefore, this research proposes Blockchain Applied FASTQ and FASTA Lossless Compression (BAQALC), a lossless compression algorithm that allows for the efficient transmission and storage of the immense amounts of DNA sequence data that are being generated by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Also, security and reliability issues exist in public sequence databases. For methods, compression ratio comparisons were determined for genetic biomarkers corresponding to the five diseases with the highest mortality rates according to the World Health Organization. The results showed an average compression ratio of approximately 12 for all the genetic datasets used. BAQALC performed especially well for lung cancer genetic markers, with a compression ratio of 17.02. BAQALC performed not only comparatively higher than widely used compression algorithms, but also higher than algorithms described in previously published research. The proposed solution is envisioned to contribute to providing an efficient and secure transmission and storage platform for next-generation medical informatics based on smart devices for both researchers and healthcare users.

TI Using Blockchain to Aggregate and Share Misconduct Issues across the

SO CURRENT ISSUES IN AUDITING
AB A perennial challenge in the accounting profession is how to aggregate and share instances of practitioner misconduct among numerous relevant parties. At present, both the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) offer solutions for centralized collection of misconduct, but both likely experience issues with incomplete reporting from key constituents. I propose a novel use of blockchain technology to address this issue, such that all key parties in the accounting profession leverage an accountancy blockchain to aggregate and share instances of practitioner misconduct across the country on a nearly real-time basis. Such a network creates an immutable record of misconduct and allows key constituents in the accounting profession to work together and share information as peers without the risk of one party taking control of the ledger. I close by discussing blockchain-specific roadblocks to realizing this proposed model.

TI BGPcoin: Blockchain-Based Internet Number Resource Authority and BGP
   Security Solution
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Without the design for inherent security, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is vulnerable to prefix/subprefix hijacks and other attacks. Though many BGP security approaches have been proposed to prevent or detect such attacks, the unsatisfactory cost-effectiveness frustrates their deployment. In fact, the currently deployed BGP security infrastructure leaves the chance for potential centralized authority misconfiguration and abuse. It actually becomes the critical yield point that demands the logging and auditing of misbehaviors and attacks in BGP security deployments. We propose a blockchain-based Internet number resource authority and trustworthy management solution, named BGPcoin, to facilitate the transparency of BGP security. BGPcoin provides a reliable origin advertisement source for origin authentication by dispensing resource allocations and revocations compliantly against IP prefix hijacking. We perform and audit resource assignments on the tamper-resistant Ethereum blockchain by means of a set of smart contracts, which also interact as one to provide the trustworthy origin route examination for BGP. Compared with RPKI, BGPcoin yields significant benefits in securing origin advertisement and building a dependable infrastructure for the object repository. We demonstrate it through an Ethereum prototype implementation, and we deploy it and do experiment on a locally-simulated network and an official Ethereum test network respectively. The extensive experiment and evaluation demonstrate the incentives to deploy BGPcoin, and the enhanced security provided by BGPcoin is technically and economically feasible.

TI ZombieCoin 2.0: managing next-generation botnets using Bitcoin
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Botnets are the preeminent source of online crime and arguably one of the greatest threats to the Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we present ZombieCoin, a botnet command-and-control (C&C) mechanism that leverages the Bitcoin network. ZombieCoin offers considerable advantages over existing C&C techniques, most notably the fact that Bitcoin is designed to resist the very same takedown campaigns and regulatory processes that are the most often-used methods to combat botnets today. Furthermore, we describe how the Bitcoin network enables novel C&C techniques, which dramatically expand the scope of this threat, including the possibilities of flexible rendezvous scheduling, efficient botnet partitioning, and fine-grained control over bots. We validate our claims by implementing ZombieCoin bots which we then deploy and successfully control over the Bitcoin network. Our findings lead us to believe that Bitcoin-based C&C mechanisms are a highly desirable option that botmasters will pursue in the near future. We hope our study provides a useful first step towards devising effective countermeasures for this threat.

TI Intellectual property law and practice in the blockchain realm
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB Blockchain technology is claimed to be and perceived as one of the revolutionary technologies that will have an enormous impact on our lives in the forthcoming years and decades. The legal questions surrounding blockchain appear to be among the most controversial issues surrounding this novel technology, which create uncertainties as to the scope and speed of its eventual adoption. Is it legal to use blockchain technology? Does or should any governmental authority or court take a record stored in blockchain into consideration in their decisions? Is blockchain reliable? Can the technology be used for the protection and enforcement of legal and property rights?
   The technological advancements offered by blockchain promise wide ranges of use in a variety of sectors and legal areas, including intellectual property (IP) law. This paper will focus primarily on the possible opportunities that blockchain may offer with respect to the future of IP law and discuss its potential impact on the registration, management and enforcement of intellectual property rights. We will proceed to offer blockchain-based solutions to foster the operation of IP offices, reinforce customs procedures in detecting counterfeit products, and enhance the efficiency of IP rights management by the right holders. The paper concludes by providing some suggestions to pave the way for the advancement of blockchain technology and to increase the number of people that this technology reaches, as well as its successful integration into the various services and registration/transaction channels that we use today.

The objective of the present paper is to identify similarities and differences between to two currency systems which represent a new generation of money that exists alongside the official and legal money system. The paper includes an analysis of the major characteristics of both currencies, their operating mechanisms in global and local contexts, as well as their risks and challenges for the financial markets. The article uses a mainly documentary research method and presents selected contributions of experts on the topics of social currencies and cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, empirical evidence is presented to highlight some important characteristics of the Bitcoin currency. The principal result of the paper is that, indeed there exist similarities between social currencies and cryptocurrencies, as for example the absence of a central bank, a lack of regulation and a limited minting process. However, because of aspects like their different origins, their local vs. global character and their inherent financial risks, the two money systems need to be interpreted as fundamentally different. Especially with reference to globally operating cryptocurrencies, given that there does not exist any public cover of the currency nor sufficient regulation, risk management mechanisms need to be improved in order to diminish the speculative tendencies inherent to this currency.

SO ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB In this study, we apply the Bitcoin to estimate the price of the Venezuelan bolivar, due to the unreliability of this currency's official exchange rate. Our approach is based on the triangular no-arbitrage condition and takes the Bitcoin as an intermediate currency. To verify its validity, in addition to bolivars, six currencies are first considered in the empirical study. We find that trading through the Bitcoin market produces higher transaction costs or requires higher risk compensation than trading through the conventional exchange market. Then, we explore the Venezuelan case. Comparing the estimates of the black market bolivars, which are generated from several popular media sources and the Web site Dolartoday.com, using Bitcoin can produce reliable bolivar exchange rates quickly and easily. To sum up, we verify the feasibility of using the triangular no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets to estimate exchange rates through the Bitcoin. This is especially useful when capital controls exist such as they do in Venezuela.

TI FinTech evolution: Strategic value management issues in a fast changing
   industry
SO STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB The FinTech revolution captures the simultaneous attack of a large number of technologies, notably mobile telephones and blockchain, which are ushering in efficiency or outreach to multiple niche markets. The use of mobile telephone technology has expanded Internet reach to the excluded, created possibilities for business where banks were not historically present and is potentially disruptive. The blockchain technology threatens to be even more disruptive as it may pull the carpet from under the monetary system as well as the property rights as we know them today. The proliferation of actors and innovators has created a confused landscape resulting in different possible scenarios, where banks may freeze, fight, form alliances with challengers, or be forced into flight by the BigTech.

TI Taking Blockchain Seriously
SO LAW AND CRITIQUE
AB In the present techno-political moment it is clear that ignoring or dismissing the hype surrounding blockchain is unwise, and certainly for regulatory authorities and governments who must keep a grip on the technology and those promoting it, in order to ensure democratic accountability and regulatory legitimacy within the blockchain ecosystem and beyond. Blockchain is telling (and showing) us something very important about the evolution of capital and neoliberal economic reason, and the likely impact in the near future on forms and patterns of work, social organization, and, crucially, on communities and individuals who lack influence over the technologies and data that increasingly shape and control their lives. In this short essay I introduce some of the problems in the regulation of blockchain and offer counter-narratives aimed at cutting through the hype fuelling the ascendency of this most contemporary of technologies.

TI Revenue Growth is the Primary Benefit of the Cloud
SO IEEE CLOUD COMPUTING
AB Cloud computing is too often seen as a tactical way to reduce costs, when its most important benefit is as a strategic way to grow revenues. Such revenue growth can come about in a variety of ways, such as through faster innovation of new products, processes, and customer interactions; identifying more customers and closing more purchases; and improving customer relationships through more targeted offers and better service and experiences. Companies that clearly understand the relative magnitude of cost savings and revenue growth and orient themselves toward the latter will better exploit the cloud and related technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things, and blockchain, and thus strengthen their competitive advantage and customer value.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Starting with BitTorrent and then Bitcoin, decentralized technologies have been on the rise over the last 15+ years, gaining significant momentum in the last 2+ years with the advent of platform ecosystems such as the Blockchain platform Ethereum. New projects have evolved from decentralized games to marketplaces to open funding models to decentralized autonomous organizations. The hype around cryptocurrency and the valuation of innovative projects drove the market cap of cryptocurrencies to over a trillion dollars at one point in 2017. These high valued technologies are now enabling something new: globally scaled and decentralized business models. Despite their valuation and the hype, these new business ecosystems are frail. This is not only because the underlying technology is rapidly evolving, but also because competitive markets see a profit opportunity in exponential cryptocurrency returns. This extracts value from these ecosystems, which could lead to their collapse, if unchecked. In this paper, we explore novel ways for decentralized economies to protect themselves from, and coexist with, competitive markets at a global scale utilizing decentralized technologies such as Blockchain.

TI Ancient Artifacts vs. Digital Artifacts: New Tools for Unmasking the
   Sale of Illicit Antiquities on the Dark Web
SO ARTS
AB Since the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS, also known as Daesh and ISIL) in 2014, antiquities have been a widely publicized source of funding for what has become one of the most technologically savvy terrorist organizations of the modern era. The globalization of technology and rise of popularity in cryptocurrencies has changed the face of black-market trade and the actors that carry out these crimes. While art and antiquities have long served as a market with susceptibilities to laundering, the emergence of Dark Web markets, identification-masking software, and untraceable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have opened new doors to potential vulnerabilities. The anonymity that is offered by these technologies acts as a roadblock for authorities, while attracting the likes of terrorists and transnational criminals. Investigative research using cyber security platforms to identify digital artifacts connected to potential traffickers provides the opportunity to unmask the seemingly untraceable actors behind these activities. The evidence of illicit antiquities trafficking on the Dark Web displayed in this article can generate a new discussion on how and where to study black-market antiquities to gain needed insight into combating the illicit trade online and the transnational criminal groups it may finance.

TI Deflationary policy under digital and fiat currency competition
SO RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS
AB I examine the implications of digital and fiat currency competition on optimal monetary policy according to the Friedman rule (a standard deflationary policy) in a Fernandez-Villaverde and Sanches (2016) framework, with no search friction. Consistent with the existing literature, first, I find that monetary equilibrium under a purely private arrangement of digital currencies will not deliver a socially efficient allocation. Second, I place restrictions on the available supply of digital currencies and find that a socially efficient allocation is possible only if the upper bound on digital currency circulation is equal to the rate of time-preference, albeit some degree of government intervention is required to curb the profit-maximizing incentive of the miners. Third, I find that optimal monetary policy at the Friedman rule will be socially inefficient when digital currencies compete with government-issued fiat money. Finally, I show that the Friedman rule is a socially desirable policy only in a purely fiat monetary regime. (C) 2018 University of Venice. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

From the temperature dependence of (C-V) it was found that these parameters are non-uniformly changed with increasing temperature in a wide temperature range of 79-360 K. The voltage and temperature dependences of apparent carrier distribution we attributed to the existence of self-assembled patches similar the quantum wells, which formed due to the process of PtSi formation on semiconductor and the presence of hexagonal voids of Si (111).

AB Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is going into a "maturity market". The main vendor providers surpassed USD 1 billion in evaluation and the research they are launching these days on the market will change again radically the business landscape. It can be seen already what is coming next to RPA: intelligent optical character recognition (IOCR), chat-bots, machine learning, big data analytics, cognitive platforms, anomaly detection, pattern analysis, voice recognition, data classification and many more. As a result the top vendors developed partnerships with the main leading artificial intelligence providers, such as: IBM Watson, Microsoft Artificial Intelligence, Microsoft Cognitive services, blockchain, Google etc. On the business part, the consulting companies who are implementing the RPA solution are moving from developing Proof-of-Concepts (POCs) and Pilots to helping clients with RAP global roll-outs and developing Centre of Excellences (CoE). As a result, the experiences gathered so far by the author on this kind of projects will be tackled also in this paper. In this article will we will present also some data related to automation for different business areas (eg. Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable etc) and how an assessment can be done correctly in order to decide if a process can be automatized and, if yes, up to which extent (ie. percent). Moreover, through the case studies we will provide (1) how now the RPA is integrated with Artificial Intelligence and Cloud, (2) how can be scaled in order to face hypes, (3) how can interpret data and (4) what savings these technologies can bring to the organizations. All the aforementioned services made Robotics Process Automation a very powerful tool since a year ago when the author did the last research. A process that was mainly not recommended for automation or was partially automated can be now fully automated with more advantages, such as: money, non-FTE savings and fulfillment time.

TI Standard form contracts and a smart contract future
SO INTERNET POLICY REVIEW
AB With a budding market of widespread smart contract implementation on the horizon, there is much conversation about how to regulate this new technology. Discourse on standard form contracts (SFCs) and how they have been adopted in a digital environment is useful toward predicting how smart contracts might be interpreted. This essay provides a critical review of the discourse surrounding digitised SFCs and applies it to issues in smart contract regulation. An exploration of the literature surrounding specific instances SFCs finds that it lacks a close examination of the textual and documentary aspects of SFCs, which are particularly important in a digital environment as a shift in medium prompts a different procedural process. Instead, common perspectives are either based on outdated notions of paper versions of these contracts or on ideologies of industry and business that do not sufficiently address the needs of consumers/users in the digital age. Most importantly, noting the failure of contract law to address the inequities of SFCs in this environment can help prevent them from being codified further with smart contracts.

TI Collaborative housing and blockchain
SO ADMINISTRATION
AB Access to housing is a crucial issue worldwide. It is still under discussion whether collaborative economy is enhancing or, on the contrary, constraining access. In this context, the concept of 'collaborative housing' (collaborative economy applied to the funding, access and organisation of housing) arises to address a range of situations that might potentially help people to access housing, such as co-housing or the so-called 'intermediate tenures'. Disintermediation through blockchain technology, and the resultant effect of a reduction in the transaction costs of access to housing, is one of those trends regarding collaborative housing. Accordingly, the adaptation of the disintermediation mechanism to the real estate conveyance and land registry, as in many other sectors of the collaborative economy, is timely. This can be achieved by exploring the potential of this mechanism in enhancing traditional methods of this sector through possible technological solutions. This paper presents a preliminary discussion on the different types of collaborative housing and the potentials of the blockchain technology to facilitate access to housing in relation to real estate conveyancing and registration.

TI Imaginaries and Crystallization Processes in Bitcoin Infrastructuring
SO COMPUTER SUPPORTED COOPERATIVE WORK-THE JOURNAL OF COLLABORATIVE
   COMPUTING
AB Imaginaries is a concept from Neumann and Star that signifies 'points of understanding' of the various stakeholder visions of an infrastructuring project. Stakeholders use imaginaries to negotiate their differences and identify shared visions. The ways in which these stakeholders negotiate these differences to agree on concrete artifacts and practices is known as crystallization. However, the CSCW literature has not studied crystallization in detail. Our case study examines imaginaries and crystallization within the infrastructuring of Bitcoin, an open source digital currency and payment platform that is the first of emerging forms of peer-to-peer computer networks facilitating digital transactions. We conducted participant observation of two Bitcoin conferences held in December 2015. Each conference lasted between two to three days, amounting to 40 hours of observation. In these conferences, we examined Bitcoin infrastructuring taking place across different contexts, including open source development and startup communities. Each of these contexts contains pre-existing infrastructures along with powerful gatekeepers (e.g., software committers and financial regulators) who maintain its system of practices and artifacts. The Bitcoin actors, including open source developers and entrepreneurs, make use of imaginaries to identify differences among them, negotiate, and reach points of crystallization in order to integrate with these infrastructures. Based on these findings, we contribute the concept of imaginaries branching and discuss roles of imaginaries in an expansive infrastructuring work interacting with multiple installed bases, some of which also introduce practical limits to the imagined information system.

This is not only information providers but also system stability, mobile-based technology, cloud system, etc. are presented for smooth use by consumers. However, the medical information handled by the service can violate the privacy of individuals. Therefore, the introduction of security technology such as encryption is necessary. Personal information must be made available only to users with access rights. For that, delegation of access rights is required from the data constructor. Also, when the authority is lost, it must be able to deprive the access right. These problems can be improved to attribute based encryption. In this paper, user attribute based encryption which can, delegate and withdraw access right to be used in medical information monitoring system is applied. In order to manage this efficiently, it is based on the network of Fog Computing environment. Authorization authentication system uses block chain method.

The blockchain era is characterized by development of a new institution of trust; disruption of financial intermediation; economic inclusion of hundreds of millions of citizens in developing countries; an increase in competition and a decrease in inequality. The authors see the blockchain revolution as a solution to the problem of discrimination against intellectual property creators, who have to hand over a large part of the value created to intermediaries. They consider the main opposition to distributed capitalism to stem from the feudal financial system which loses ground under new conditions, where economic agents may use alternative currencies and interact directly with each other without risk and high transaction costs.

TI Performance innovations in the IBM z14 platform
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB The IBM z14 platform brings together numerous innovations that collectively provide considerable performance gains over prior designs for the full spectrum of modern workloads being run on today enterprise systems. These workloads range from traditional online transaction processing and batch workloads to Linux-based and cloud-based workloads, leveraging advances in analytics, mobile transaction processing, social data mining, cognitive applications, security (blockchain), and other areas. The performance gains in the z14 platform required advancements in the processor hardware microarchitecture, physical design, and instruction-set architecture, as well as in the firmware and hypervisor stacks. The result is a comprehensive platform solution that enables efficient multiprocessor scaling for large single-image partitions and mixed-workload multipartition environments within a single platform, while remaining responsive to the "bursty" demands of batch and transaction-based workloads. The performance gains present in the z14 are a direct result of the collaborative efforts between diverse teams within IBM working together to produce advancements in hardware, firmware, and software that outpace the gains of the individual contributions. In this paper, we discuss these results with a focus on the client value delivered through system performance and workload responsiveness.

As these devices increase, an enormous amount of data bound and personal information etc. are bound by external environmental information and so forth. loT device size is increasing more and more problems such as hacking by a centralized management system and a duo such as DDoS attack are emerging. The technology to distribute and manage recent data provides the reliability without the third party who has the block chain certified. Since it manages data by distributing it, it has the effect of reducing intermediate fee and construction cost, data consistency is secured and it has high security. In this paper, we discuss a method to securely manage distributed identifiers of contents. Confidential identifiers can be safely stored and managed via these identifier division management systems.

For the screening of asymptomatic tumors, their identification, and their treatment with better and targeted therapies, the integration of information from imaging, genomics, and biomarkers is needed. To bring these (un) structured data together, block chain technology is required, while knowledgeable analysts should be available. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to 'team up' and provide a common strategy for innovation. Its implementation needs the involvement of all stakeholders (patients, industries, professionals, scientists, governments).

TI HOW TO ADD CONCURRENCY TO SMART CONTRACTS
SO BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION FOR THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as the Ethereum project, permit complex financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners.
   Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics.
   This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and "discovering" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions. This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a name coined to the digital ecosystem of numerous internet connected devices. It brings the physical world closer to the digital one and as a result, allows for new applications and services. The emergence of Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, presents a possible solution to ensure trust in decentralized systems. Blockchain brings trust, immutability, and verifiability of a distributed ledger in a decentralized network which could be useful to build trust in IoT. However, the integration of IoT with Blockchain involves a number of challenges. The use of Blockchain within the IoT is a recent and a fast paced topic. Therefore, conducting a systematic literature review is essential to understand what has been proposed on the topic. Recent work has provided a systematic review with a focus on Bitcoin. In this paper, we present a systematic review of more recent work on Blockchain and IoT, with a broader focus on Blockchain platforms beyond Bitcoin. Our work provides an overview of what has been done so far on the use of Blockchain and IoT.

AB The Estonian electronic voting system which is a leading electronic voting system still suffers from universal verifiability issues and may need improvement of its availability. To solve the problems, in this paper we propose a blockchain-based electronic voting system. A blockchain is a distributed database, where the complete data is shared among all participants in the network. A blockchain system by its nature has several advantages that suit an electronic voting system. Its distributed architecture provides high availability to the system because it does not rely on a centralized server. As all participants have complete data, the protocol allows them to verify each block that is appended to the chain. We try to combine the double envelope encryption technique and blockchain technology for our proposed electronic voting system.

AB This paper discusses a potentially serious attack against public crypto-currency mining pools. By deliberately introducing errors under benign miners' names, this attack can fool the mining pool administrator into punishing any innocent miner; when the top miners are punished, this attack can significantly slow down the overall production of the mining pool. We show that an attacker needs only a small fraction (e.g., one millionth) of the resources of a victim mining pool, which makes this attack scheme very affordable by a less powerful competing mining pool. We experimentally confirm the effectiveness of this attack scheme against a few well-known mining pools such as Minergate and Slush Pool.

AB Blockchain technology is a ledger system that is popularly known as the backbone of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Since its conception, the potential beneficial applications of blockchain in other digital sectors have been lauded in the literature, and related challenges have been disputed. In this study, the literature is reviewed for frameworks and use cases that fully realize the applicability of blockchain beyond financial applications and cryptocurrencies. A network analysis of the literature was performed to identify the most popularly documented digital sectors in this context, which include the Internet of Things (IoT), healthcare, supply chain management, and government sectors. For each sector, this review documents use cases in which an attempt is made to implement blockchain solutions. The main purpose of this paper is to probe each sector for the growing maturity of blockchain technology and to document the unique benefits and challenges arising from the use of this technology. The findings show that despite the growing reputation of blockchain technology, its implementation within these four sectors remains in infancy because the use cases lack concrete evaluations of its effectiveness and plausibility. Nevertheless, the categorization of current blockchain use cases demonstrates current applications and sector-specific concerns that suggest future directions for further research.

AB Recently, blockchain has been foreseen by industry and research community as a transformational and disruptive technology that is poised to play a major role in transforming the way we transact, trade, bank, track and register assets, and do business. Blockchain can potentially be used to provide trusted authenticity, origin, and ownership for IoT devices, in a way that is secure and decentralized without the involvement of a Trusted Third Parties (TTP) or centralized authorities and services. A TTP can be a subject to a single point of failure, and it can be disrupted, compromised or hacked. A TTP can potentially misbehave and become corrupt in the future, even if it is trustworthy now. This paper shows how Ethereum blockchain (with the powerful feature of programmability through smart contracts) can provide a trusted ownership management for medical IoT (MIoT) devices. Tracking the true ownership of MIoT devices is of a paramount importance as using counterfeited MIoT devices can be life-threatening to patients. The paper presents a general framework and solution to manage and trace back the true origin of ownership for an MIoT; whereby an MIoT device can be owned by multiple parties during its life cycle. The paper presents a detailed overview of our proposed system architecture, design, entity relationship, and interactions among all involved parties. The source code of the Ethereum smart contracts is made publicly available. Key aspects related to the algorithms, interactions, implementation and testing are discussed in the paper. Furthermore, we provide security analysis of our proposed solution in terms of satisfying the general security goals and also resiliency against popular attacks as those of DDoS, eavesdropping and replay attacks.

AB Ethereum is a public (permissionless) blockchain with a Turing complete execution machine for smart contracts. Miners that execute a smart contract receive a fee determined by the gas associated with the operation codes (opcodes) in the smart contract. It is important that the gas award is proportional to the computation resources required, to assure that incentives are aligned and denial of service attacks are avoided. Currently, the amount of gas awarded is set statically for each opcode, but it is unknown if these values are correct for various computer architectures. Therefore, we propose in this paper a benchmark approach to assess the computational resources required per opcode. We apply the benchmark approach to PC and MAC as a first illustration of the approach.

AB Mission-critical applications such as industrial control, smart grids, security and surveillance systems are highly dependent on cloud-centric IoT networks. In such networks, the diverse IoT devices harvest the data from the remote environments and relay it to multiple intermediate agents over the wireless links towards the cloud for storage, analysis and decision making. Such systems require highly trustworthy data to guarantee accurate and timely decisions. However, in most of the cases, the IoT data becomes dubious during the transmission towards the cloud. Ensuring data provenance in such a heterogeneous multi-layered system is a critical security issue. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure data provenance framework for cloud-centric IoT network by utilizing the immutable, deterministic and public nature of the blockchain smart contracts with the traditional cloud infrastructure. In the framework, the cryptographic hash of the device metadata is stored in the blockchain whereas actual data is stored off-chain i.e., in the cloud, making it highly scalable for a dense deployment of IoT devices in the network. Multiple smart contracts are stationed in the blockchain to guarantee the provenance receipt to the data stored in the cloud. The initial evaluation revealed that the proposed framework is highly acceptable in achieving the data provenance for large-scale cloud-centric IoT networks.

AB These days, IoT devices are deployed at a massive scale, with Cisco predicting 20 billion devices by the year 2020. As opposed to endpoint devices, IoT devices are resource-constrained devices, incapable of securing and defending themselves, and can be easily hacked and compromised. Fog computing can augment such capacity limitations by providing localized compute, storage, and networking for a group of IoT devices. As fog nodes are deployed in close proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can be more effective than cloud computing. Furthermore, Blockchain has emerged as technology with capabilities to provide secure management, authentication and access to IoT devices and their data, in decentralized manner with high trust, integrity, and resiliency. In this paper, we propose a user authentication scheme using blockhain-enabled fog nodes in which fog nodes interface to Ethereum smart contracts to authenticate users to access IoT devices. The fog nodes are used to provide scalability to the system by relieving the IoT devices from carrying out heavy computation involving tasks related to authentication and communicating with the blockchain. We describe system components, architecture and design, and we discuss key aspects related to security analysis, functionality, testing and implementation of the smart contracts. The full code of the smart contracts for authentication registry, lists, rules and logic is also made publicly available at Github.

AB Blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed storage that stores chronological series of transactions in a tamper-resistant manner. Blockchain became popular in various industries due to its decentralized trust ecosystem. When integrating blockchain with big data, one encounters many challenges. Current public blockchain does not support high transaction throughput; it does not scale in terms of big data storage and management; it does not provide keyword-based search and retrieval; and so on. As a result, it is hard to incorporate existing blockchain systems for big data applications. In this research, we propose a new blockchain storage "Mystiko" that is built over the Apache Cassandra distributed database to incorporate big data. Mystiko supports high transaction throughput, high scalability, high availability and full text search features. With Mystiko, we make big data more secure, structured and meaningful, and allows further data analytics on big data to be more easily performed.

AB This paper explores the contrasting notions of "permanance and disposability," "the digital and the physical," and "symbolism and function" in the context of interaction design. Drawing from diverse streams of knowledge, we describe a novel design direction for enduring computational heirlooms based on the marriage of decentralized, trustless software and durable mobile hardware. To justify this concept, we review prior research; attempt to redefine the notion of "material;" propose blockchain-based software as a particular digital material to serve as a substrate for computational heirlooms; and argue for the use of mobile artifacts, informed in terms of their materials and formgiving practices by mechanical wristwatches, as its physical embodiment and functional counterpart. This integration is meant to enable mobile and ubiquitous interactive systems for the storing, experiencing, and exchanging value throughout multiple human lifetimes; showcasing the feats of computational sciences and crafts; and enabling novel user experiences.

AB In Bitcoin, the most common kind of transactions is in the form "Bob pays Alice", and it is based on the Pay toPublic Key Hash (P2PKH) script. P2PKH transactions are just one among many standard classes: a transaction is standard if it passes BitcoinCore's IsStandard() and IsStandardTx() tests. However, the creation of ad-hoc scripts to lock (and unlock) transactions allows for also generating non-standard transactions, which can be nevertheless broadcast and mined as well. In this work, we explore the Bitcoin block-chain with the purpose to analyse and classify standard and non-standard transactions, understanding how much the standard behaviour is respected.

AB We present Strain, a new auction protocol running on top of blockchains and guaranteeing bid confidentiality against fully-malicious parties. As our goal is efficiency and low blockchain latency, we abstain from using traditional, highly interactive MPC primitives such as secret shares. We focus on a slightly weaker adversary model than MPC which allows Strain to achieve constant latency in both the number of parties and the bid length. The main idea behind Strain is a new maliciously-secure two-party comparison mechanism executed between any pair of bids in parallel. Using zero-knowledge proofs, Strain broadcasts the outcome of comparisons on the blockchain in a way that all parties can verify each outcome. Strain's latency is not only asymptotically optimal, but also efficient in practice, requiring a total of just 4 blocks of the underlying blockchain. Strain provides typical auction security requirements such as non-retractable bids against fully-malicious adversaries.

In recent work, we proposed a new notion of strong policies with implicit coordination. With this it is possible to solve planning tasks with joint goals from a single-agent perspective without the agents having to negotiate about and commit to a joint policy at plan time. We study how and under which circumstances the decentralized application of those policies leads to the desired outcome.

AB Blockchain-based replicated ledgers, pioneered in Bitcoin, are effective against double spending, but inherently attract centralised mining pools and incompressible transaction delays.
   We propose a framework that forgoes blockchains, building a decentralised ledger as a self-scaling graph of cross-verifying transactions. New transactions validate prior ones, forming a thin graph secured by a cumulative proof-of-work mechanism giving fair and predictable rewards for each participant.
   We exhibit rapid confirmation of new transactions, even across a large network affected by latency. We also show, both theoretically and experimentally, a strong convergence property: that any valid transaction entering the system quickly become enshrined in the ancestry of all future transactions.

AB Blockchains store a massive amount of heterogeneous data which will only grow in time. When searching for data on the Ethereum platform, one is required to either access the records (blocks) directly by using a unique identifier, or sequentially search several records to find the desired information. Therefore, we propose the Ethereum Query Language (EQL), a query language that allows users to retrieve information from the blockchain by writing SQL-like queries. The queries provide a rich syntax to specify data elements to search information scattered through several records. We claim that EQL makes it easier to search, acquire, format, and present information from the blockchain.

TI From digital currencies to digital finance: the case for a smart
   financial contract standard
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of a cash flow generating standard for individual financial contract level data and the ability to create such a standard.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors analyze the importance for such a standard of software that turns natural language contracts into cash flow generating algorithms; a data dictionary that standardizes contract terms; and access to variables that represent the state of the world (e.g. market risk, counterparty risk, etc.) that affect contractual obligations.
   Findings The ability to realize benefits from the use of such a contract level algorithmic standard depends on the following: making the standard's software open source; fully testing the software to have complete confidence in its accuracy; and enabling the software to use of a wide range of models of various sources of risk (market, credit and behavior risk) to support forward-looking analysis. Such a standard would solve the disconnect that exists in financial firms between the representation of financial contracts for transaction processing and analysis. The ACTUS Financial Research Foundation is building, testing and making available such a standard that represents almost all financial contracts extant in markets.
   Practical implications The adoption of such a standard would reduce the costs of operations of financial firms, provide the computational infrastructure for more effective regulatory oversight, reduce regulatory reporting costs and improve financial market transparency. It would also enable the assessment of systemic risk by directly quantifying the interconnectedness of firms.
   Originality/value This is a new approach to financial analytics that clearly separates the deterministic components of finance, which can be standardized from the stochastic elements that cannot be standardized.

AB Bug bounties are a popular tool to help prevent software exploits. Yet, they lack rigorous principles for setting bounty amounts and require high payments to attract economically rational hackers. Rather than claim bounties for serious bugs, hackers often sell or exploit them.
   We present the Hydra Framework, the first general, principled approach to modeling and administering bug bounties that incentivize bug disclosure. Our key idea is an exploit gap, a program transformation that enables runtime detection, and rewarding, of critical bugs. Our framework transforms programs via N-of-N-version programming, a variant of classical N-version programming that runs multiple independent program instances.
   We apply the Hydra Framework to smart contracts, small programs that execute on blockchains. We show how Hydra contracts greatly amplify the power of bounties to incentivize bug disclosure by economically rational adversaries, establishing the first framework for rigorous economic evaluation of smart contract security. We also model powerful adversaries capable of bug withholding, exploiting race conditions in blockchains to claim bounties before honest users can. We present Submarine Commitments, a countermeasure of independent interest that conceals transactions on blockchains.
   We design a simple, automated version of the Hydra Framework for Ethereum (ethereum.org) and implement two Hydra contracts, an ERC20 standard token and a Monty-Hall game. We evaluate our implementation for completeness and soundness with the official Ethereum Virtual Machine test suite and live blockchain data.

AB The growing interest for decentralized production of renewable energies calls for new market approaches. In this context, the blockchain is considered as a key technology for enabling decentralized local energy markets. Following this idea, several market solutions were proposed by the academic community. However, their technical feasibility or economical viability are yet to be assessed due to the lack of simulation frameworks. In this paper, we propose an agent-based simulation framework to experiment blockchain-backed energy market places. Moreover, based on realistic data of households located in northern France, we perform a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of parameters on economics and blockchain system performances. Finally, we have implemented our solution on Raspberry Pies IoT devices to measure the actual power consumption of such systems.

AB Every year, traffic collisions have increased rapidly in proportion to the increase in the number of vehicles, especially at intersections. The main cause is human error in recognition and decision-making. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) systems represent emerging challenges. AVs can take a great deal of different actions when approaching an intersection. Several research centers are developing algorithms to solve one of the crucial aspects of autonomous driving, i.e the intersections management, trying to avoid collisions and traffic congestion. In this context, security is the main concern, due to the high exposure to data and information between Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Intersection (V2I) communications. Blockchain and smart contracts, one of most promising technologies emerged in recent years, represent a possible solution for the existing security issues. Smart contracts are the orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and negotiated agreement between the consenting parties participating in the Blockchain network. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent AIM (MA-AIM) system based on V2I/I2V communication to securely manage vehicles crossing though an intersections by leveraging Blockchain facilities. A central Intersection Manager Agent (IMA) is implemented at each intersection while each vehicle is controlled by a Driver Agent (DA).

SO INTERDISCIPLINARY DESCRIPTION OF COMPLEX SYSTEMS
AB A means of exchange and preservation of value is likely as old as our species. Global economic trade is often argued to be as old as trade. The question of the nature of the exchange, of who creates the value and how it is regulated is the issue. While tin from England may have reached Sumeria 4 000 years ago, or Phoenicians' ships entered the Africa area of Cape Palmas at about the same time, the problem of exchange is a central issue. Ideas of money are as diverse as the cultures that produce them, yet today global trade is experiencing modifications of the satisfaction of exchange with new platforms of electronic money. Blockchain technology is touted as foolproof, such claims have appeared in the past with various financial innovations. Such abstractions of value may not be new, but as a product of technology and complexity they create psychological novelty and a form of mesmerizing fetishism (Douglas, M. and Isherwood, B., ed.: The World of Goods: Towards an Anthropology of Consumption. Routledge, London, 1978). Manias of value are also not new, from stock (South Seas Corporation) to tulips (MacKay, C.: Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds. Crown Press, London, 1841). The form of the mania is defined and expressed culturally but is often associated with technological change and distance of exchange of partners and clients (Baric, L.: Some aspects of credit, saving and investment in a 'non-monetary' economy (Rossel Island). In: Firth, R. and Yamey, B. S., eds.: Capital, Saving and Credit in Peasant Societies. Aldine Publishing, Chicago, pp. 35-52, 1964.). Inequality is also a feature, embedded in economic and technological disruption of trade and exchange. The role of redistribution and taxation are essential in maintaining social credit and equality. We can relate such behaviour to other systems of animal societies.

AB Autonomous connected vehicles are a main concept in the future of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) since they provide an increase in safety and road efficiency. The management and coordination of the connected vehicles is based on periodic communications among the vehicles involved in the network, and with their surrounding environment. However, a major concern regarding this information sharing process is how to provide a secure transmission while fulfilling the latency requirements. Here we propose the use of a joint paradigm to securely manage the inter-vehicular communications. First, a ring-signature based scheme is applied to verify the identity of the vehicles joining the network. Second, the information is shared among the vehicles and consensually verified using a blockchain-based mechanism using secure communication channels created by multi-party smart contracts. The proposed protocol fulfills the stringent requirements in latency for vehicular networks by means of almost instantaneous communications while providing an anonymous secure system for the members of the network relying on cryptographic primitives.

TI Interpretation of Contracts and Smart Contracts: Smart Interpretation or
   Interpretation of Smart Contracts?
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB The computer language (computer code) on the basis of which smart contracts are written is different from the natural (Human) language. Computer language is a 'dry' language, whereas natural language is 'wet'. In other words, it means that computer language is deterministic (just one meaning and one result are conceivable), when natural language is open to more and potential different meanings. Natural language requires therefore in itself interpretation, at least more than computer language. Computer language in theory doesn't require and possibly doesn't leave room for interpretation. If this assumption is accurate, what are the consequences of it (on the intention of the parties, on contract drafting, on courts' intervention.)? Building on that assumption, this article explores, from a comparative perspective, the impact of the blockchain- based smart contract technology, especially regarding contract drafting techniques. Contract drafting style in common law (long contracts, based on a 'if., then..' approach, quite similar to the coding approach) is in part based on the idea of preventing courts' interpretation and intervention. In civil law countries instead, contracts are generally shorter, for several reasons but partly because drafters tend to rely on more general legal concepts, external to the contract, and know that courts will play an important role, through interpretation, in disclosing the 'true meaning' of a contract. Coding contracts and relying on computer- code language can hence have a significant impact on the civil law approach and bring the two legal systems closer as far as contract drafting and contract interpretation are concerned.

AB With the rise in worth and popularity of cryptocurrencies, a new opportunity for criminal gain is being exploited and with little currently offered in the way of defence. The cost of mining (i.e. earning cryptocurrency through CPU-intensive calculations that underpin the blockchain technology) can be prohibitively expensive, with hardware costs and electrical overheads previously offering a loss compared to the cryptocurrency gained. Off-loading these costs along a distributed network of machines via malware offers an instantly profitable scenario, though standard Anti-virus (AV) products offer some defences against file-based threats. However, newer fileless malicious attacks, occurring through the browser on seemingly legitimate websites, can easily evade detection and surreptitiously engage the victim machine in computationally-expensive cryptomining (cryptojacking).
   With no current academic literature on the dynamic opcode analysis of cryptomining, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first such experimental study. Indeed, this is the first such work presenting opcode analysis on non-executable files. Our results show that browser-based cryptomining within our dataset can be detected by dynamic opcode analysis, with accuracies of up to 100%. Further to this, our model can distinguish between cryptomining sites, weaponized benign sites, de-weaponized cryptomining sites and real world benign sites. As it is process-based, our technique offers an opportunity to rapidly detect, prevent and mitigate such attacks, a novel contribution which should encourage further future work.

AB The rise of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has increased the popularity of blockchain technology, the framework these cryptocurrencies are built upon. The security and access control that blockchain technology has provided for cryptocurrencies has peaked the curiosity of other industries, realizing its potential value and future outlook. In this paper, we analyze two types of blockchains, permission-ed and permission-less, and introduce a two-tier blockchain concept utilizing both types for secure data sharing. We provide background on the consensus algorithms used for each blockchain type, Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Authority. Testing on both Mac OS and Ubuntu Linux-based system environments, preliminary results show that by increasing the number of miners in a Proof-of-Work consensus, there is a correlating increase in the total block count in a permissionless blockchain, where the rate of increase is dependent on the system environment. In the Proof-of-Authority permission-ed blockchain, the block count observed little to no change across both environments.

AB Smart contracts are programs stored and executed on a blockchain. The Ethereum platform, an open-source blockchain-based platform, has been designed to use these programs offering secured protocols and transaction costs reduction. The Ethereum Virtual Machine performs smart contracts runs, where the execution of each contract is limited to the amount of gas required to execute the operations described in the code. Each gas unit must be paid using Ether, the crypto-currency of the platform. Due to smart contracts interactions evolving over time, analyzing the behavior of smart contracts is very challenging. We address this challenge in our paper. We develop for this purpose an innovative approach based on the non negative tensor decomposition PARATUCK2 combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) to assess if predictive analysis can forecast smart contracts interactions over time. To validate our methodology, we report results for two use cases. The main use case is related to analyzing smart contracts and allows shedding some light into the complex interactions among smart contracts. In order to show the generality of our method on other use cases, we also report its performance on video on demand recommendation.

AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger that gained a prevalent attention in many areas. Many industries have started to implement blockchain solutions for their application and services. It is important to know the key components, functional characteristics, and architecture of blockchain to understand its impact and applicability to various applications. The most well-known use case of blockchain is bitcoin: a cryptocurrency. Being a distributed ledger, consensus mechanism is needed among peer nodes of a blockchain network to ensure its proper working. Many consensus algorithms have been proposed in literature each having its own performance and security characteristics. One consensus algorithm cannot serve the requirements of every application. It is vital to technically compare the available consensus algorithms to highlight their strengths, weaknesses, and use cases. We have identified and discussed parameters related to performance and security of consensus in blockchain. The consensus algorithms are analyzed and compared with respect to these parameters. Research gap regarding designing an efficient consensus algorithm and evaluating existing algorithms is presented. This paper will act as a guide for developers and researchers to evaluate and design a consensus algorithm.

AB Bitcoin has shown great utility around the world with the drastic increase in its value and global consensus method of proof-of-work (POW). Over the years after the revolution in the digital transaction space, we are looking at major scalability issue with old POW consensus method and bitcoin peak limit of processing only 7 transactions per second. With more companies trying to adopt blockchain to modify their existing systems, blockchain working on old consensus methods and with scalability issues can't deliver the optimal solution. Specifically, with new trends like smart contracts and DAPPs, much better performance is needed to support any actual business applications. Such requirements are pushing the new platforms away from old methods of consensus and adoption of off-chain solutions. In this paper, we discuss various scalability issues with the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchain and recent proposals like the lighting protocol, sharding, super quadratic sharding, DPoS to solve these issues. We also draw the comparison between these proposals on their ability to overcome scalability limits and highlighting major problems in these approaches. In the end, we propose our solution to suffice the scalability issue and conclude with the fact that with better scalability, blockchain has the potential to outrageously support varied domains of the industry.

AB Proof-of-work was originally proposed by Dwork and Naor in 1992 and has proved its powerfulness in Bitcoin as a decentralized mechanism for blockchain construction. Proof-of-work is the basis of most popular cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems, where participating miners are required to solve difficult mathematical problems to validate transactions. One of the major challenges that proof-of-work faces is the 51% attack, i.e., if an adversary controls more than half of the computation power, he/she can control the blockchain construction and determine which blocks will be included. This is not a major concern when the number of miners is large. However, for an early stage blockchain system with a limited number of users, it is relatively easy for an attacker to launch the 51% attack. To mitigate such risk, we propose a new hybrid blockchain construction scheme that uses the combination of proof-of-work and the stake, which is the number of coins produced by a miner, to determine whether this miner is allowed to construct a block. We prove that stakes play an important role in the hybrid scheme at the beginning, so that an attacker is not able to launch the 51% attack even if he/she controls the majority of the computational power. Meanwhile, the hybrid scheme will converge to pure proof-of-work after sufficiently many blocks are generated, and thus captures the desired properties of proof-of-work. Most importantly, such a convergence is "smooth" in the sense that neither changes in the rules nor parameters are introduced, and thus no hard/soft-forks will be triggered. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the new scheme using simulations with different configurations, which can help a designer to select adequate parameters for a specific blockchain application.

AB In a research community, the provenance sharing of scientific workflows can enhance distributed research cooperation, experiment reproducibility verification and experiment repeatedly doing. Considering that scientists in such a community are often in a loose relation and distributed geographically, traditional centralized provenance sharing architectures have shown their disadvantages in poor trustworthiness, reliabilities and efficiency. Additionally, they are also difficult to protect the rights and interests of data providers. All these have been largely hindering the willings of distributed scientists to share their workflow provenance. Considering the big advantages of blockchain in decentralization, trustworthiness and high reliability, an approach to sharing scientific workflow provenance based on blockchain in a research community is proposed. To make the approach more practical, provenance is handled on-chain and original data is delivered off-chain. A kind of block structure to support efficient provenance storing and retrieving is designed, and an algorithm for scientists to search workflow segments from provenance as well as an algorithm for experiments backtracking are provided to enhance the experiment result sharing, save computing resource and time cost by avoiding repeated experiments as far as possible. Analyses show that the approach is efficient and effective.

AB With the onset of the big data era, designing efficient and effective machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale data is in dire need. In practice, data is typically generated by multiple parties and stored in a geographically distributed manner, which spurs the study of distributed machine learning. Traditional master-worker type of distributed machine learning algorithms assumes a trusted central server and focuses on the privacy issue in linear learning models, while privacy in nonlinear learning models and security issues are not well studied. To address these issues, in this paper, we explore the blockchain technique to propose a decentralized privacy-preserving and secure machine learning system, called LearningChain, by considering a general (linear or nonlinear) learning model and without a trusted central server. Specifically, we design a decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm to learn a general predictive model over the blockchain. In decentralized SGD, we develop differential privacy based schemes to protect each party's data privacy, and propose an l-nearest aggregation algorithm to protect the system from potential Byzantine attacks. We also conduct theoretical analysis on the privacy and security of the proposed LearningChain. Finally, we implement LearningChain on Etheurum and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness through extensive experiments.

AB Personal data such as electronic medical records and academic records are critical and sensitive private information. These personal information is usually hosted across many data-custodian systems. Personal Data Store (PDS) is a service that lets an individual store, manage and deploy their key personal data in a highly secure and structured way. It also gives the user a central point of control for their personal information. One of the inherent problems of digital records is that it can be easily forged. Therefore, the data-consumer(with whom the data is shared) often needs to verify the authenticity of the shared document/record by communicating with the document/certificate issuing authority (e.g., data custodian). However, this process is time consuming and inefficient. In recent time, blockchain has gained tremendous attention from both industry and academia for distributed recording and immutable transactions. Blockchain provides a shared, immutable and transparent history of transactions enabling the building of applications that incorporate trust, accountability and transparency. This provides a unique opportunity to develop a secure and trustable data sharing system using blockchain. However, blockchain is primarily proposed for publicly verifiable transactions and does not provide privacy to the individuals. In this paper, we propose a data sharing framework that will guarantee the authenticity of the shared data in real-time and provide transactional privacy in a blockchain network. We have implemented our framework in a prototype that ensures privacy, integrity, and fine-grained access control over the shared data. The proposed work can significantly reduce the turnaround time for data sharing, improve the decision making process and reduce the overall cost.

AB Blockchain technologies are rapidly gaining attention in the multi-agent systems (MAS) community to face critical issues such as trust, secured communications, and data consistency. In particular, the notion of smart contract can be exploited to deploy trustworthy computations automatically executed by the network in a consistent way. MAS coordination modelling and engineering of agents interaction in a MAS thus represents an appealing application field for smart contracts, potentially enabling fully-decentralised, trustworthy coordination. Along this line, we focus on the Ethereum blockchain technology, map it onto LINDA tuple-based coordination model, and discuss two proof of-concept implementations of LINDA on Ethereum. We hence demonstrate conceptual and technical feasibility of blockchain-based coordination in MAS, while emphasising issues of applying the blockchain beyond accountability and identity management.

AB Trust management is extremely important for sensor networks, and the emerging vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) does not represent an exception. In fact, it allows to realize a dynamic access control needed to cope with internal attacks conducted by compromised nodes, which are likely to occur in real world. However, trust management implies a considerable consumption of energy, due to the amount of messages exchanged to collect reputation scores. Consumption is further exacerbated by the means needed to protect from attacks the trust management entities themselves.
   This work proposes a suitable trust management for the IoT by exploiting the eventual consistency and security guarantees of blockchain. The design of a solution based on such a technology is described, and a qualitative assessment of its protection degree is provided.

AB Bitcoin and its peculiar, decentralized transaction system, have already ignited interest by professional and retail traders in search for profits and by economists and legal experts, looking for possible regulation to contain illegal uses. We instead examine the unexpected and ongoing success of Bitcoin from a sociological perspective, first questioning its unusual legitimation system, backed by the so called 'blockchain technology', instead of by governmental authorities. Then we collect data and elements to reconstruct Bitcoin's history as a cryptocurrency, starting from the mysterious story surrounding its birth. We then follow its spread and development through social networks and words of mouth, together with its sudden booms and bursts, finally to suggest that both users and institutional regulators should be aware of the risks of Bitcoin and of its alleged power to challenge our very notion of money.

AB This paper introduces a new leaderless Byzantine consensus called the Democratic Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DBFT) for blockchains. While most blockchain consensus protocols rely on a correct leader or coordinator to terminate, our algorithm can terminate even when its coordinator is faulty.
   The key idea is to allow processes to complete asynchronous rounds as soon as they receive a threshold of messages, instead of having to wait for a message from a coordinator that may be slow. The resulting decentralization is particularly appealing for blockchains for two reasons: (i) each node plays a similar role in the execution of the consensus, hence making the decision inherently "democratic"; (ii) decentralization avoids bottlenecks by balancing the load, making the solution scalable.
   DBFT is deterministic, assumes partial synchrony, is resilience optimal, time optimal and does not need signatures. We first present a simple safe binary Byzantine consensus algorithm, modify it to ensure termination, and finally present an optimized reduction from multivalue consensus to binary consensus whose fast path terminates in 4 message delays.

TI Platform modelling and scheduling game with multiple intelligent
   cloud-computing pools for big data
SO MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS
AB We develop a generic game platform that can be used to model various real-world systems with multiple intelligent cloud-computing pools and parallel-queues for resources-competing users. Inside the platform, the software structure is modelled as Blockchain. All the users are associated with Big Data arrival streams whose random dynamics is modelled by triply stochastic renewal reward processes (TSRRPs). Each user may be served simultaneously by multiple pools while each pool with parallel-servers may also serve multi-users at the same time via smart policies in the Blockchain, e.g. a Nash equilibrium point myopically at each fixed time to a game-theoretic scheduling problem. To illustrate the effectiveness of our game platform, we model the performance measures of its internal data flow dynamics (queue length and workload processes) as reflecting diffusion with regime-switchings (RDRSs) under our scheduling policies. By RDRS models, we can prove our myopic game-theoretic policy to be an asymptotic Pareto minimal-dual-cost Nash equilibrium one globally over the whole time horizon to a randomly evolving dynamic game problem. Iterative schemes for simulating our multi-dimensional RDRS models are also developed with the support of numerical comparisons.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), typically also referred to as drones, are gaining popularity and becoming ubiquitous. As the number of drones in the sky rapidly grows, managing the expected high-volume air traffic is becoming a critical challenge. It is essential to prevent collisions, and to protect the public from nuisances like noise or invasion of privacy, and shield from hazards like falling debris. UAV traffic management should comply with regulation, spatiotemporal constraints and limitations of drones. Spatiotemporal constraints could be no-flight zones or areas where drone flight times are restricted. Drone limitations could refer to their speed, flight range, telecommunication capabilities, etc. Furthermore, managing air traffic for UAVs is very different from managing the traffic of self-driving ground vehicles. First, there are no clearlymarked roads in the sky. Second, some UAVs cannot hover and must have a cleared flight path. Third, air traffic should be managed in a 3 -dimensional space. In this paper we present a vision of air-traffic control based on geofencing. We discuss three operation modes: centralized, decentralized and a hybrid of the two other modes. We present some of the challenges involved in drone traffic control and illustrate how geofencing could be a useful tool for that, while leveraging the emerging 5G networking technology.

We have simulated a microgrid with ten buildings in the northeast U.S., and results of the transaction distribution and electricity utilization are presented. We also present the effects on energy distribution when one or two smart meters have their identities corrupted. We then propose a new approach to digital identity management that would require smart meters to authenticate with the blockchain ledger and mitigate identity-spoofing attacks. Applications of this approach to defense against port scans and DDoS, attacks are also discussed.

TI Cryptocurrency Networks: A New P2P Paradigm
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB P2P networks are the mechanism used by cryptocurrencies to disseminate system information while keeping the whole system as much decentralized as possible. Cryptocurrency P2P networks have new characteristics that propose new challenges and avoid some problems of existing P2P networks. By characterizing the most relevant cryptocurrency network, Bitcoin, we provide details on different properties of cryptocurrency networks and their similarities and differences with standard P2P network paradigms. Our study allows us to conclude that cryptocurrency networks present a new paradigm of P2P networks due to the mechanisms they use to achieve high resilience and security. With this new paradigm, interesting research lines can be further developed, both in the focused field of P2P cryptocurrency networks and also when such networks are combined with other distributed scenarios.

AB It is difficult to deny the impact of the formation of the so-called crypto-economy on existing financial institutions. This current trend has taken shape and has taken its place in the current economic environment. Despite this, in view of the absence of regulatory and legal regulation, basic concepts, methods of evaluation, management and optimization of crypto-economics processes have not yet been formulated. The present study is devoted to the pricing of ICO as a source of financing for the activities of enterprises that are used practically in all sectors of the economy.

AB Cryptocurrencies and Distributed Ledger Technologies, such as Ethereum have received extensive attention over the past few years. With the increasing popularity of Ethereum, comprehensive understanding of its various properties plays a critical role in the widespread adaptation. However, due to the significant requirements for deploying a full Ethereum blockchain and high running costs, it is challenging to study the dynamic properties of the Ethereum. In this work, we propose eVIBES, a configurable simulation framework for gaining empirical insights into the dynamic properties of Ethereum.

AB Bitcoin is a new digital currency created with the aim of being decentralized, peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, borderless, scarce, fast and cheap to use. Since Bitcoin main way of operating is based on broadcast communications, e.g. all transactions of the currency reach all network peers, how to achieve scalability is one of the most important concerns for it to achieve wide usage. One of the proposals to improve its scalability takes the form of the Lightning Network (LN) which consists of an overlay network on top of the base Bitcoin layer. Such an overlay allows to perform a new kind of off-blockchain transactions, i.e. transactions not broadcast to the entire network, that, differently from previous off-blockchain solutions, do not require to put trust in any third entity.
   Important open problems of the LN are i) defining how payments should be routed and ii) establishing which fee policies intermediate nodes should apply for forwarding payments. The contributions of this work are twofold: we first propose a new, more general, way for nodes to apply fees for forwarding payments which allows to keep the network balanced and improve its performance in the long term. Secondly, we propose a new multipath routing payment scheme, based on the atomic multipath payment method, which is able to significantly reduce the fees paid by users, while being fast and also able to keep the network balanced.

TI Quandary of Smart Contracts and Remedies: The Role of Contract Law and
   Self-Help Remedies
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB Smart contracts provide a quandary for contract law remedies. The self-enforcing nature of smart contracts implies that there is little possibility for breach and thus, little need or opportunity to apply contract law remedies. This article explores if this is really the case. It concludes that contract law remains applicable to smart contracts relating to the enforceability of its terms based on legality, public policy, and contracts policing doctrines. In such cases, post hoc judicial or arbitral claims remain likely and the dispute resolution bodies would seek to apply contract remedies. In order to diminish instances of litigation or arbitration the smart contract should include self-remedying or internal measures (remedies). The article divides internal measures into proactive and reactive measures. These measures should be considered in the drafting of a smart contract in order to diminish resort to contract remedies. In the end, contract law and contract remedies will remain important as default law. In addition, like smart contracts, some of contract law rules are immutable and cannot be made obsolete by blockchain technology.

   Tax Treaty Dispute Resolution: Part 2
SO INTERTAX
AB In Part 1 of this article, the authors analysed the main drawbacks of the existing tax treaty dispute resolution process and considered the fundamental features of the main types of disruptive technology. keeping in mind how they could improve this process.
   In this part. the authors make some specific suggestions as to how the analysed technologies tan be used to improve the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) and supplementary solutions. This will include the use of video conferencing to cut costs and speed up resolution (section 2); electronic filing and checking of the MAP request with respect to documentation requirements (section 3); automatic notification as regards the deadline before arbitration is triggered and automatic forwarding of the request and any supplementary information to the other competent authority(ies): automatic notification of the taxpayer of each material step taken in the resolution of the case (without providing access to secure data); communication and exchange of information between competent authorities via secure electronic means in real time; and information storage in secure shared-data platforms (i.e. controlled aims) allowing access to competent authorities and even to the arbitral panel, where required (section 3); the use of data analytics to cluster cases by type, allowing for easier center dot inventory management. and to generate risk profiles that could help in both the prevention of MAP cases and the speedier resolution thereof (section 4): the use of artificial intelligence to review past eases, thereby allowing easier assignment to case workers, depending on their schedule, and thus, easier and more timely solutions based on precedents (maim 5); and the use of blockchain to validate transactions and information and to remove the need for trust, thus allowing for an easier and quicker resolution, especially in multilateral cases (section 6).
   Finally, the author's proposal posits that due to communication requirements, costs and security considerations, the implementation of technology solutions requires a global, coordinated approach, which should be spearheaded and managed by international organizations such as the OECD and the UN. The implementation could be completed in several stages and be subject to peer reviews.

AB The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is one of the most widely used schemes in deployed cryptography. Through its applications in code and binary authentication, web security, and cryptocurrency, it is likely one of the few cryptographic algorithms encountered on a daily basis by the average person. However, its design is such that executing multi-party or threshold signatures in a secure manner is challenging: unlike other, less widespread signature schemes, secure multi-party ECDSA requires custom protocols, which has heretofore implied reliance upon additional cryptographic assumptions such as the Paillier encryption scheme.
   We propose new protocols for multi-party ECDSA key generation and signing with a threshold of two, which we prove secure against malicious adversaries in the random oracle model using only the Computational Diffie-Hellman Assumption and the assumptions already implied by ECDSA itself. Our scheme requires only two messages, and via implementation we find that it outperforms the best prior results in practice by a factor of 55 for key generation and 16 for signing, coming to within a factor of 12 of local signatures. Concretely, two parties can jointly sign a message in just over two milliseconds.

AB Wearable smart sensing devices presently become more and more popular in peoples daily life, which also brings serious problems related to personal data privacy. In order to provide users better experiences, wearable smart sensing devices are collecting users' personal data all the time and uploading the data to service provider to get computing services, which objectively let service provider master each user's condition and cause a lot of problems such as spam, harassing call, etc. This paper designs a blockchain based scheme to solve such problems by cutting off the association between user identifier and its sensing data from perspective of shielding service providers and adversaries. Firstly, privacy requirements and situations in smart sensing area are reviewed. Then, three key technologies are introduced in the scheme including its theories, purposes and usage. Next, the designed protocol is shown and analyzed in detail. Finally, security analysis and engineering feasibility of the scheme are given. This scheme will give user better experience from privacy protection perspective in smart sensing area.

TI THE SPECIFICITIES OF USING CRYPTOCURRENCY IN PURCHASE AND SALE CONTRACTS
SO BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES
AB The aim of the article is to study the theoretical and legal possibilities of using cryptocurrency in purchase and sale contracts, to determine the specificities of such a phenomenon as cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) from the perspective of jurisprudence, and to draw attention of legal scholars primarily to possible further scientific researches on the introduction of this phenomenon in the modern civilian legislation of Ukraine. The subject of the study is the specificities of using cryptocurrency in contracts of purchase and sale. Methodology. The research is based on an analysis of legal acts on the legal regulation of cryptocurrency in Ukraine. By means of the comparative legal method of investigation of certain provisions of Ukrainian legislation, the possibilities and limits of the use of cryptocurrency in contractual relations, in particular, contracts of purchase and sale are determined. The results of the study revealed that the cryptocurrency regime in Ukraine and in many countries is in a legal vacuum. Such a conclusion is based on the lack of clear legal clarification and consolidation of the concept and types of cryptocurrency in the relevant rules of the tax, banking, civil, and commercial law. In case of eliminating this gap, it is advisable to review the state policy on Bitcoin and its analogues. Practical implications. It is necessary and appropriate to introduce a corresponding license for cryptocurrency activities that can minimize the laundering of proceeds from crime or terrorism financing. It is suggested that eventually the relations concerning the digital currency will be regulated in Ukraine, but most likely, it will copy the experience of another state, which may have negative consequences. Relevance/originality. Analysis of a possible use of cryptocurrency in contracts of purchase and sale can become the basis for the development of the most promising directions of domestic civil law in contractual relations.

AB One of the fundamental challenges that hinder further adaption of decentralized cryptocurrencies is scalability. Because current cryptocurrencies require that all transactions are processed and stored on a distributed ledger -the so-called blockchain -transaction throughput is inherently limited. An important proposal to significantly improve scalability are off-chain protocols, where the massive amount of transactions is executed without requiring the costly interaction with the blockchain. Examples of off-chain protocols include payment channels and networks, which are currently deployed by popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A further extension of payment networks envisioned for cryptocurrencies are so-called state channel networks. In contrast to payment networks that only support off-chain payments between users, state channel networks allow execution of arbitrary complex smart contracts. The main contribution of this work is to give the first full specification for general state channel networks. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and prove the security of our construction against powerful adversaries. An additional benefit of our construction is the use of channel virtualization, which further reduces latency and costs in complex channel networks.

However, applying DPoS to the decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) applications is quite challenging due to the nature of IoT systems such as large-scale deployments and huge amount of data. To address the unique challenge for IoT based blockchain applications, we present Roll-DPoS, a randomized delegated proof of stake algorithm. Roll-DPoS inherits all the advantages of the original DPoS consensus framework and further enhances its capability in terms of decentralization as well as extensibility to complex blockchain architectures. A number of modern cryptographic techniques have been utilized to optimize the consensus process with respect to the computational and communication overhead.

AB This paper describes how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) can be used to enforce social contracts and to orchestrate the behavior of agents trying to access a shared resource. The first part of this paper analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of using DLTs architectures to implement certain control systems in an Internet of Things (IoT) setting and then focuses on a specific type of DLT based on a directed acyclic graph. In this setting, we propose a set of delay differential equations to describe the dynamical behavior of the Tangle, an IoT-inspired directed acyclic graph designed for the cryptocurrency IOTA. The second part proposes an application of DLTs as a mechanism for dynamic deposit pricing, wherein the deposit of digital currency is used to orchestrate access to a network of shared resources. The pricing signal is used as a mechanism to enforce the desired level of compliance according to a predetermined set of rules. After presenting an illustrative example, we analyze the control system and provide sufficient conditions for the stability of the network.

AB Subversion zero knowledge for non-interactive proof systems demands that zero knowledge (ZK) be maintained even when the common reference string (CRS) is chosen maliciously. SNARKs are proof systems with succinct proofs, which are at the core of the cryptocurrency Zcash, whose anonymity relies on ZK-SNARKs; they are also used for ZK contingent payments in Bitcoin.
   We show that under a plausible hardness assumption, the most efficient SNARK schemes proposed in the literature, including the one underlying Zcash and contingent payments, satisfy subversion ZK or can be made to at very little cost. In particular, we prove subversion ZK of the original SNARKs by Gennaro et al. and the almost optimal construction by Groth; for the Pinocchio scheme implemented in libsnark we show that it suffices to add 4 group elements to the CRS. We also argue informally that Zcash is anonymous even if its parameters were set up maliciously.

AB The recently growing tokenization process of digital and physical assets over the Ethereum blockchain requires a convenient trade and exchange mechanism. Sealed-bid auctions are powerful trading tools due to the advantages they offer compared to their open-cry counterparts. However, the inherent transparency and lack of privacy on the Ethereum blockchain conflict with the main objective behind the sealed-bid auctions. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and present a smart contract protocol for a succinctly verifiable sealed-bid auction on the Ethereum blockchain. In particular, we utilize various cryptographic primitives including zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Public-Key Encryption (PKE) scheme, and commitment scheme for our approach. First, the proving and verification keys for zk-SNARK are generated via an MPC protocol between the auctioneer and bidders. Then, when the auction process starts, the bidders submit commitments of their bids to the smart contract. Subsequently, each bidder individually reveals her commitment to the auctioneer using the PKE scheme. Then, according to the auction rules, the auctioneer claims a winner and generates a proof off-chain based on the proving key, commitments which serve as public inputs, and their underlying openings which are considered the auctioneer's witness. Finally, the auctioneer submits the proof to the smart contract which in turn verifies its validity based on the public inputs, and the verification key. The proposed protocol scales efficiently as it has a constant-size proof and verification cost regardless of the number of bidders. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of the smart contract design, in addition to the estimated gas costs associated with the different transactions.

AB Blockchain, as a mechanism to decentralize services, security, and verifiability, offers a peer-to-peer system in which distributed nodes collaboratively affirm transaction provenance. In particular, blockchain enforces continuous storage of transaction history, secured via digital signature, and affirmed through consensus. In this study, we consider the recent surge in blockchain interest as an alternative to traditional centralized systems, and consider the emerging applications thereof. In particular, we assess the key techniques required for blockchain implementation, offering a primer to guide research practitioners. We first outline the blockchain framework in general, and then provide a detailed review of the component data and network structures. Additionally, we consider the breadth of applications to which blockchain has been applied, broadly implicating Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and Cloud and Edge computing paradigms, along with many other emerging applications. Finally, we assess the various challenges to blockchain implementation for widespread practical use, considering the security vulnerabilities to majority attacks, selfish mining, and privacy leakage, as well as performance limitations of blockchain platforms in terms of scalability and availability.

TI TRACEABLE SHARES AND CORPORATE LAW
SO NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
AB A healthy system of shareholder voting is crucial for any regime of corporate law. The proper allocation of governance power is subject to debate, of course, but the fitness of the underlying mechanism used to stuff the ballot boxes should concern everyone. Proponents of shareholder power, for instance, cannot argue for greater control if the legitimacy of the resulting tallies is suspect. And those who advocate for board deference do so on the bedrock of authority that reliable shareholder elections supposedly confer.
   Unfortunately, our trust in the corporate franchise was forged during an era that predates modern complexities in the way that stock ownership is now tracked and traded. We do not trace shares, and any clear-eyed look at the conferral of voting rights via back-end stock clearing practices is unsettling. Evidence of the various entanglements crops up from time to time-in the form of questionable voting outcomes or disputes about standing for shareholder lawsuits-but the underlying problems are systemic, not episodic. Our stock clearing system is a kludge.
   This is an important moment for corporate law, however, because new technology is approaching a state where clearing and settlement systems may soon support traceable shares. The rise of distributed ledgers and blockchain technology is poised to allow for specific share identification and precise records of share provenance. This may sound like an uninteresting technical sideshow, but as this Article will argue, the impact of traceable shares on corporate law will be profound. It will change the structure of shareholder lawsuits, alter the allocation of corporate governance rights, and require lawmakers to rethink fundamental principles of shareholder responsibility for corporate misdeeds.

AB The recent explosion of interest in blockchains led to a plethora of proposals for their application, including attempts to decentralize some centralized network functions. At the same time, real "distributed wireless networks" are emerging. Community networks, for instance, are large mesh networks made of hundreds of nodes built by communities primarily to solve digital divide, and they are thriving. The challenges these networks face are not only technological: they deal with creating incentives to participate, with the business model they may adopt, and with their internal governance. Very few models have been proposed to apply blockchains to bottom-up distributed networks: we instead expose how they can solve many problems which so far hindered the diffusion of such networks. Maybe we can push this further: a network is, in essence, a system in which all nodes find a rough consensus on the best paths to connect a node with another. Can we use this consensus method to run a distributed ledger and a cryptocurrency within the network itself, rather than simply applying to networks the effects of a blockchain defined in a separate system? This paper introduces this concept, named "Proof of Networking", and discusses its potential avails.

AB We present a secure approach for maintaining and reporting credit history records on the Blockchain. Our approach removes third-parties such as credit reporting agencies from the lending process and replaces them with smart contracts. This allows customers to interact directly with the lenders or banks while ensuring the integrity, unmalleability and privacy of their credit data. Additionally, each customer has full control over complete or selective disclosure of her credit records, eliminating the risk of privacy violations or data breaches. Moreover, our approach provides strong guarantees for the lenders as well. A lender can check both correctness and completeness of the credit data disclosed to her. This is the first approach that can perform all credit reporting tasks without a central authority or changing the financial mechanisms*.

AB Big data technology has brought innovation and convenience to many areas, such as medical diagnosis, financial investment and smart travel. However, one of the most urgent challenges is how to collect massive private data from end customers effectively without invasion of privacy. In this paper, a framework, called Trusted Big Data Collection and Trade (TBDCT) system, is proposed to provide a fair and trusted platform for every participant in big data world. Firstly, by adopting technology of Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), data is binded with the 'fingerprint' of the sensor to identify the authenticity of source. Secondly, private network attached storage embedded with Trusted Security Module (TSM) is used to guarantee the trustability of collecting process. Lastly, blockchain is implemented in this system to provide decentralized accounting and trading platform. With this framework, private data can be traded and the conflict between private data shortage and invasion of privacy can be mitigated. The experiment demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed TBDCT.

AB Autonomous vehicles are capable of sensing their environment and navigating without any human inputs. However, when autonomous vehicles are involved in accidents between themselves or with human subjects, liability must be indubitably decided based on accident forensics. This paper proposes a blockchain-inspired event recording system for autonomous vehicles. Due to the inefficiency and limited usage of certain blockchain features designed for the traditional cryptocurrency applications, we design a new "proof of event" mechanism to achieve indisputable accident forensics by ensuring that event information is trustable and verifiable. Specifically, we propose a dynamic federation consensus scheme to verify and confirm the new block of event data in an efficient way without any central authority. The security capability of the proposed scheme is also analyzed against different threat and attack models.

AB Proof-of-work (PoW) is an algorithmic tool used to secure networks by imposing a computational cost on participating devices. Unfortunately, traditional PoW schemes require that correct devices perform computational work perpetually, even when the system is not under attack.
   We address this issue by designing a general PoW protocol that ensures two properties. First, the network stays secure. In particular, the fraction of identities in the system that are controlled by an attacker is always less than 1/2. Second, our protocol's computational cost is commensurate with the cost of an attacker. That is, the total computational cost of correct devices is a linear function of the attacker's computational cost plus the number of correct devices that have joined the system. Consequently, if the network is attacked, we ensure security, with cost that grows linearly with the attacker's cost; and, in the absence of attack, our computational cost is small. We prove similar guarantees for bandwidth cost.
   Our results hold in a dynamic, decentralized system where participants join and depart over time, and where the total computational power of the attacker is up to a constant fraction of the total computational power of correct devices. We show how to leverage our results to address important security problems in distributed computing including: Sybil attacks, Byzantine Consensus, and Committee Election.

AB This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based technique for creating an environment where individuals can be the custodians of their official education records and can easily share those records with others. A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, open record of all cryptographic data exchanges. One key characteristic of the blockchain is its decentralized nature. Unlike records or accounts maintained by department, college, university, government agencies and other institutions, the blockchain does not require an intermediary to complete education records or alter records. Our solution incorporating the advanced features of blockchain allows education providers to issue official certificates that supply proof of completion or achievement. The proposed framework could also provide the corresponding functions for the after-college education and many other further usages.

AB The widespread adoption of fax machines in the 1980s revolutionised everyday communications. It was quickly adopted as the standard form of communication across the globe. Since then, the internet has replaced fax as a truly global form of instant communication. However, the fax machine still reigns as the primary form of communication in a number of industries, healthcare being one of them.
   This paper presents a system that uses a blockchain and an off-chain centralised data storage to give patients and medical professionals instant access to their medical records from anywhere. By assigning each medical record a pseudo anonymous identifier, a second layer "blockchain" for each user can be created allowing for the rapid collection and querying of data. The off-chain pseudo anonymous data storage allows for the data to remain unencrypted enabling the rapid generation of anonymous medical datasets which can be used for machine learning and data mining on the data, potentially bringing many benefits to the healthcare industry.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrency systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have attracted much attention during the last decade. In recent years, a trend of combining Internet of Things (IoT) devices with blockchain technology has emerged. Digital payments can be made on front-end IoT devices, while a back-end blockchain serves as a distributed ledger to ensure the validity of payments across the system. Nevertheless, fast payments are usually on demand in such a scenario, but an open problem still remains on how to protect blockchain-based systems from double-spending attacks in the context of fast payment. Off-chain techniques, such as Lightning Network and Raiden Network, act as countermeasures to this problem, but they all suffer from the hidden transactions problem. To combat this problem, we propose FastPay, a solution for achieving secure fast payments in blockchain-backed edge-IoT systems. Preliminary evaluation on our prototype demonstrates the effectiveness of FastPay.

AB The blockchain based decentralized cryptocurrency platforms are one of the hottest topics in tech at the moment. Though most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology.
   The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts are Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help maturing the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts.
   As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 10,000 smart contracts with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, not overly complex and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 80% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities.

AB Blockchain technology enables the creation of a decentralized environment, where transactions and data are not under the control of any third party organization. Any transaction ever completed is recorded in a public ledger in a verifiable, secure, transparent and permanent way, with a timestamp and other details. Introduced in 2009 as the core mechanism for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency and its worldwide payment system, blockchain has had many applications in domains such as IoT, finance, business, management, health and education. Also new platforms and tools for blockchain implementation were developed. As education becomes more open, diversified, democratised, and decentralised, the blockchain technology is taken in consideration by researchers, teachers and institutions, to maintain reputation, trust in certification, and proof of learning. In the first part of the paper, we explore the blockchain technology. Next, existing global and governmental initiatives, together with potential applications of blockchain in different domains are presented. The need to learn about this emerging technology is demonstrated, together with pioneering cases in different universities. Then we propose a public blockchain called OpenEduChain, designed as a repository for open educational assets (Open Educational Resources - OERs, Massive Open Online Courses - MOOCs, open pedagogies and scenarios), but also to deliver issued certificates and open badges by universities and other educational and training institutions. At university level, OpenEduChain, implemented on Ethereum, is used to store data about the open educational items created by faculty members and students. Also digital certificates or open badges are provided to the participants in the trainings and workshops. After a period of tests, OpenEduChain usage could be extended at national level, but also for new purposes such as e-portfolios or assessment.

AB Digital coin became an interesting subject for research in the last few years. For security reasons, the technical detail of digital coins (for example Bitcoin) are studied to stop security breaches. Bitcoin work dependently on a blockchain. Blockchain holds the record of all user's transactions. The user opens a wallet with public/private key pairs. The user then buy/sell his coin through the wallet. The security of the user's wallet depends on how secure the user's private key. Some people hide bitcoins (which in this case refers to the private key) in their house. Others hide the security key into a plain-text. In this paper we proposed a robust steganography technique to hide bitcoins into steganographic fractals. Steganographic fractal is our novel approach, it is not explored before. The fractal tree is selected for its simple recursive structure. The private-key bit stream is hidden by discretizing the angles and lengths of the tree branches. The tree can then be printed without the fear of being lost or stolen. The proposed approach showed high security and robustness to attacks.

AB Extensive online knowledge sharing can be exploited to solve tasks better, faster and cheaper, and it garners considerable interest in institutional cooperation, learning communities, etc., while many technical problems, such as fair exchange in incentive design and security issues are waiting to be solved. Blockchain technique has high accountability and thus has potential to improve the transparency and security of knowledge sharing. In this paper, to address the above problems, first we propose a Reputation Based Knowledge Sharing system in blockchain, called RBKS. The aim of RBKS is to exploit the copyright protection of the knowledge owner using our proposed fine-grained access control system, and to achieve the paid-for content service which allows bystanders who are interested in the shared knowledge to pay a small fee for the access. Second, a reputation evaluation algorithm is introduced as the core of the incentive, and it may possibly be combined with stake in blockchain to form a hybrid stake for the RBKS system. Third, a blockchain and a trusted storage server are employed together for sharing and storing knowledge, and the main procedures are implemented with smart contract in blockchain to ensure secure execution and fairness. Finally, our analysis shows that the RBKS system is feasible and secure.

In our previous work [1], [2], we proposed a messaging system model in which a single intermediate node relays a message. In this paper, we propose a novel model with multiple intermediate nodes that allow a message to reach a destination node. We introduce blockchain technology to distributedly record nodes' actions, such as sending messages, relaying messages, and receiving messages. We examine frauds in our proposal protocol to demonstrate that selfish nodes cannot commit frauds.

AB Security and privacy are vital to the modern blockchain technology since it can exist without an authorized third party, which means that there may not be a trusted responsible person or organization in charge of systems. In this chapter we make a survey on this issue about blockchain systems. Security of the current systems is based on the computational hardness assumptions and many of the standard cryptography systems are known to be vulnerable against the advent of full-fledged quantum computers. On the other hand, it is possible to make a blockchain more secure by virtue of quantum information technology. In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to quantum information theory and quantum computation so that readers can follow advanced researches on application of quantum technology to the blockchain industry. We also explain a novel information system which accommodates quantum states in a peer-to-peer way. It would improve the level of privacy and security by the laws of physics, which is never achievable from nonquantum information theoretic viewpoints.

AB As soon as the usage of cryptocurrency in the last few years has been gaining popularity all over the world, and this global trend has affected Ukraine, the purpose of the paper is to examine the essence of cryptocurrency, to identify the issues of its legal regulation in Ukraine, as well as using the analysis of world experience in this sphere, to identify ways of the improvement for relevant domestic legislation. The authors have indicated that the cryptocurrency market (or "virtual" money) operates successfully and provides an opportunity to analyse dynamics of the cost, supply, and demand of about 90-100 different cryptocurrency. Problem's setting. The authors of the paper have emphasized that despite increasing popularity of cryptocurrency in Ukraine and throughout the world, there is no single clear definition of this concept. Therefore, the authors of this article state that cryptocurrency is a digital decentralized currency, a unit of which is a coin cryptographically protected against tampering since it is encrypted information that cannot be copied, while all information about transactions is stored in the blockchain system. Methodology. The study primarily uses comparative methods for the purposes of examination of the approaches taken under different jurisdictions towards cryptocurrency. Additionally, analysis of the body of theoretical literature on the matter was conducted. Results of the study allowed drawing several conclusions on the prospects of further development of the legal framework for cryptocurrencies in Ukraine since nowadays the country is neutral in the issue of using and regulating cryptocurrency and consequently it is losing precious time, because: first, potentially loses money, which could enter the state budget from individuals, who receive income from transactions on cryptocurrency markets; and secondly, the state runs a risk of citizens' rights violation because of no real instruments for their protection. Practical implications of these are proposals to adopt certain amendments to the current legislation in this sphere, including setting up control over brokerage of cryptocurrency, licensing of the industry, and legal definition of the cryptocurrency for the purposes of taxation, etc. Value/originality. The paper represents one of the first comprehensive studies of the current state and prospects of development of the legal framework for the cryptocurrency in Ukraine. Its conclusions provide both proposals for the development of legislation in this sphere and may serve as a basis for the future studies of this topic.

TI Illicit Bitcoin transactions: challenges in getting to the who, what,

SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the intelligence and investigatory challenges experienced by law enforcement agencies in discovering the identity of illicit Bitcoin users and the transactions that they perform. This paper proposes solutions to assist law enforcement agencies in piecing together the disparate and complex technical, behavioural and criminological elements that make up cybercriminal offending.
   Design/methodology/approach A literature review was conducted to highlight the main law enforcement challenges and discussions and examine current discourse in the areas of anonymity and attribution. The paper also looked at other research and projects that aim to identify illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the darknet.
   Findings An optimal solution would be one which has a predictive capability and a machine learning architecture which automatically collects and analyses data from the Bitcoin blockchain and other external data sources and applies search criteria matching, indexing and clustering to identify suspicious behaviours. The implementation of a machine learning architecture would help improve results over time and would be less manpower intensive. Cyber investigators would also receive intelligence in a format and language that they understand and it would allow for intelligence-led and predictive policing rather than reactive policing. The optimal solution would be one which allows for intelligence-led, predictive policing and enables and encourages information sharing between multiple stakeholders from the law enforcement, financial intelligence units, cyber security organisations and fintech industry. This would enable the creation of red flags and behaviour models and the provision of up-to-date intelligence on the threat landscape to form a viable intelligence product for law enforcement agencies so that they can more easily get to the who, what, when and where.
   Originality/value The development of a functional software architecture that, in theory, could be used to detected suspicious illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network.

AB Digitalization of the energy grid, leading to a so-called smart grid, offers notable benefits to the electricity system itself, and creates economic, social, and environmental value for different parties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of understanding the value proposition underlying a technically feasible smart grid initiative. In this paper we identify requirements towards an approach for understanding the value proposition of a smart grid initiative, and propose a first step towards such an approach in the form of a landscape of modeling languages complemented by a process model for valuation. We evaluate the proposed approach, among others, by applying it to a blockchain-based initiative in the energy sector.

AB We present Arbitrum, a cryptocurrency system that supports smart contracts without the limitations of scalability and privacy of systems previous systems such as Ethereum. Arbitrum, like Ethereum, allows parties to create smart contracts by using code to specify the behavior of a virtual machine (VM) that implements the contract's functionality. Arbitrum uses mechanism design to incentivize parties to agree off-chain on what a VMwould do, so that the Arbitrum miners need only verify digital signatures to confirm that parties have agreed on a VM's behavior. In the event that the parties cannot reach unanimous agreement off-chain, Arbitrum still allows honest parties to advance the VM state on-chain. If a party tries to lie about a VM's behavior, the verifier (or miners) will identify and penalize the dishonest party by using a highly-efficient challenge-based protocol that exploits features of the Arbitrum virtual machine architecture. Moving the verification of VMs' behavior off-chain in this way provides dramatic improvements in scalability and privacy. We describe Arbitrum's protocol and virtual machine architecture, and we present a working prototype implementation.

TI An innovative RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and
   supervisory reporting
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a bearer service, which generates and maintains a digital doppelganger for every financial contract in the form of a dynamic transaction document that is a standardised data facility automatically making important contract data from the transaction counterparties available to relevant authorities mandated by law to request and process such data. This would be achieved by sharing certain elements of the dynamic transaction document on a bearer service, based on a federation of distribution ledgers; such a quasi-simultaneous sharing of risk data becomes possible because the dynamic transaction document maintain a record of state in semi-real time, and this state can be verified by anybody with access to the distribution ledgers, also in semi-real time.
   Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the authors propose a novel, regular technology (RegTech) cum automated legal text approach for financial transaction as well as financial risk reporting that is based on cutting-edge distributed computing and decentralised data management technologies such as distributed ledger (Swanson, 2015), distributed storage (Arner et al., 2016; Chandra et al., 2013; Caron et al., 2014), algorithmic financial contract standards (Brammertz and Mendelowitz, 2014; Breymann and Mendelowitz, 2015; Braswell, 2016), automated legal text (Hazard and Haapio, 2017) and document engineering methods and techniques (Glushko and McGrath, 2005). This approach is equally inspired by the concept of the bearer service and its capacity to span over existing and future technological systems and substrates (Kavassalis et al., 2000; Clark, 1988).
   Findings The result is a transformation of supervisors' capacity to monitor risk in the financial system based on data which preserve informational content of financial instruments at the most granular level, in combination with a mathematically robust time stamping approach using blockchain technology.
   Practical implications The RegTech approach has the potential to contain operational risk linked to inadequate handling of risk data and to rein in compliance cost of supervisory reporting.
   Originality value The present RegTech approach to financial risk monitoring and supervisory reporting is the first integration of algorithmic financial data standards with blockchain functionality.

AB Blockchain platforms when used as a database for IoT systems can resolve data reliability, fault-tolerance, consistency and non-repudiation issues. However, their inherent shortcomings related to their throughput in terms of processed transactions, limit their applicability in such environments in a decentralized way as the underlying network is unable to sustain high workloads. In this paper a fully decentralized high performance consensus mechanism, named FAST, is proposed for a public blockchain. FAST is based on mapreduce paradigm for aggregating and adding transactions on blockchain blocks. FAST was implemented and evaluated in a basic blockchain prototype. A light client for FAST using IPFS, was developed to bring about a reduction in the data stored locally. The obtained results from tests conducted on the prototype depict that FAST exceeds the performance of not just other existing blockchain platforms but comes very close to the throughput of traditional electronic payment networks such as Visa.

AB Expectation of cryptocurrencies has been increased rapidly and all of these cryptocurrencies are generated on blockchain platform. This means not only the paradigm is changing in the field of finance but also the blockchain platform is technically stable. Based on the stability of blockchain, many kind of crypto currencies or application platforms are being implemented or released and world famous banks are applying blockchain on their financial service[1]. Even law for exchanging cryptocurrencies is being discussed. Furthermore, blockchain platforms also run programmed source code which is called as smart contract on its distributed platform. Smart contract extends usage of blockchain platform. So in this paper, we propose an algorithm for recording and managing location data of IoT service provider and user based on blockchain with smart contract. Our proposal records data of participants in network by blockchain which ensures security and match with other optimized participant by spatial data processing.

TI Dynamically Adjusting the Mining Capacity in Cryptocurrency with Binary
   Blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORKED AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Many cryptocurrencies rely on Blockchain for its operation. Blockchain serves as a public ledger where all the completed transactions can be looked up. To place transactions in the Blockchain, a mining operation must be performed. However, due to a limited mining capacity, the transaction confirmation time is increasing. To mitigate this problem many ideas have been proposed, but they all come with own challenges. We propose a novel parallel mining method that can adjust the mining capacity dynamically depending on the congestion level. It does not require an increase in the block size or a reduction of the block confirmation time. The proposed scheme can increase the number of parallel blockchains when the mining congestion is experienced, which is especially effective under DDoS attack situation. We describe how and when the Blockchain is split or merged, how to solve the imbalanced mining problem, and how to adjust the difficulty levels and rewards. We then show the simulation results comparing the performance of binary blockchain and the traditional single blockchain.

AB Many cloud and cryptocurrency applications rely on verifying the integrity of outsourced computations, in which a verifier can efficiently verify the correctness of a computation made by an untrusted prover. State-of-the-art protocols for verifiable computation require that the computation task be expressed as arithmetic circuits, and the number of multiplication gates in the circuit is the primary metric that determines performance. At the present, a programmer could rely on two approaches for expressing the computation task, either by composing the circuits directly through low-level development tools; or by expressing the computation in a high-level program and rely on compilers to perform the program-to-circuit transformation The former approach is difficult to use but on the other hand allows an expert programmer to perform custom optimizations that minimize the resulting circuit. In comparison, the latter approach is much more friendly to non-specialist users, but existing compilers often emit suboptimal circuits.
   We present xJsnark, a programming framework for computation that aims to achieve the best of both worlds: offering programmability to non-specialist users, and meanwhile automating the task of circuit size minimization through a combination of techniques. Specifically, we present new circuit friendly algorithms for frequent operations that achieve constant to asymptotic savings over existing ones; various globally aware optimizations for short- and long- integer arithmetic; as well as circuit minimization techniques that allow us to reduce redundant computation over multiple expressions. We illustrate the savings in different applications, and show the framework's applicability in developing large application circuits, such as ZeroCash, while minimizing the circuit size as in low-level implementations.

AB This article is focused on the area of energy efficiency of cryptocurrencies. Nowadays, nearly two thirds of all cryptocurrencies use Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to add new blocks to blockchain network The energy sustainability of whole networks using PoW algorithm is very doubtful. Furthermore, we can see that lots of cryptocurrencies are trying to implement and move to more efficient consensus algorithms like Proof of Stake (PoS). Therefore, in this article we present three potential scenarios to perform transition between PoW and PoS.

AB The purpose of this article is to examine the contemporary developments of the global digital trends and investigate the most perspective digital technologies crucial for international companies. The relevance of foresight methodology application is justified. The paper's focus is on future trends of digital technologies by providing a brief literature review in the fields of digital technologies and relevant marketing resources. Key assumptions, expectations and uncertainties about the future are re-evaluated. It is justified that long-term thinking is crucial to frame future strategies not only for governments and citizens but also for both small and international companies. Three global trends within the field of digital technologies are investigated: artificial intelligence, block chain and big data. The marketing resources which are currently arising and developing with the highest potential of dominating and revolutionizing the future of marketing are described: internet of things, social media, virtual and augmented reality. The author used the example of augmented reality expansion and development as one of the most promising global trends. Survey methodology was applied to evaluate the potential of augmented reality (AR) application using one of the most promising international industry adopters: the tourism industry. The AR mobile apps generated $ 2 billion in revenue as of the end of 2016 and according to the investigations the AR market could grow to $ 120 billion by 2020. The research results have shown that 84% to 100% of generation Y & Z consumers, whose consumption patterns would shape future demand, see clear benefits in using augmented reality applications in tourism industry.

AB We study and develop an automated platform for shareholder rights management using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), in collaboration with an equity crowdfunding company. DLT has high impact potential for the multi-agent systems domain, as it allows participants to agree on the values of shared variables and keep a history of how the values change over time. DLT also enables participants to know that the shared values are common knowledge. In our application, the shared variables that the agents agree on are the shareholder rights. Knowing that there is common agreement on these rights allows us to develop related applications, such as a shareholder voting system. In this paper, we discuss the shareholder rights management platform and briefly mention a related shareholder voting system, both currently under development.

AB The H2020 European research project Safe Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) aims to develop a cyber-security layer on IoT smart home installations. The proposed system analyses packet-level data flows for building patterns of communications between IoT devices and external entities. To ensure non repudiation, integrity and authentication of the data captured, they are stored in a Blockchain, a distributed ledger network, as digitally-signed transactions. Since the data can potentially include sensitive user information, it is imperative to promote trust by informing users about the operating principles of the network as well as to request the acceptance of a consent form by them. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Forms of Consent application, a Distributed Application that interacts with a set of Smart Contracts deployed on a private Ethereum network. The application is being developed as part of the GHOST project.

AB Autonomous driving (AD) promises to disrupt current process management practices in the automotive industry, as processes now have to fulfill increasing requirements for safety, quality and liability. This paradigm change especially manifests itself among electrical system suppliers, as the electrical components transmit the vehicle's energy and communication flow, determining safety critical functions in the vehicle such as steering and braking. In this research, we conducted a multiple embedded case study in the electrical supplier industry in order to derive current challenges as well as future requirements for production processes of safety critical products in the age of autonomous driving. Our data suggest, that the established manufacturing process and practices are unable to fulfill the increasing need for digital continuity, transparency and documentation. To overcome those barriers, we propose a blockchain (BC) and Internet of Things (IoT) enabled traceability system. Through the application of BC, processes can be interconnected, tracked and audited, achieving higher security, liability and quality. This is the first paper, which investigates manufacturing of electrical systems for self-driving vehicles as a suitable use case for BC application.

AB A trusted electronic election system requires that all the involved information must go public. However, it focuses not only on transparency but also on privacy issues. In other words, each ballot should be counted anonymously, correctly, and efficiently. In this work, an effective e-voting system is proposed for voters to minimize their trust in the authority or government. We ensure the transparency of election by putting all messages on the Ethereum blockchain; in the meantime, the privacy of individual voter is protected via an effective ring signature mechanism. Besides, the attractive self-tallying feature is also built in our system, which guarantees that everyone who can access the blockchain network is able to tally the result on his own, i.e., no third party is required after the voting phase. More importantly, we ensure the correctness of voting results and keep the Ethereum gas cost of individual participant as low as possible, at the same time. Moreover, the pre-described characteristics of stealth address in our system makes it more suitable for large-scale election on line.

AB Cooperative Intelligent Transportation System (CITS) enables inter-networking of vehicles for alerts exchanging in order to improve road safety. While this technology is about to enter the market in the upcoming years, critical questions related to the communication security continue to be challenging research concerns. Current solutions to secure inter-vehicle communication depend mainly on the use of digital certificates for authentication. However, such an approach imposes significant overhead on vehicles since it is computationally demanding and requires validation of the certificate within a limited period. In addition, relying on a central node for deciding on issuing and revoking certificates introduces a single point of failure and could even risk the safety of motorists. In this paper, we propose the use of Blockchain to keep track of the certificate of each vehicle (valid or revoked) in distributed and immutable records. In essence we replace certificate verification with a lightweight blockchain-based authentication approach. In addition, we propose a fully distributed vehicle admission/revocation scheme. We show that our scheme could alleviate the computation overhead and enhance the response time while improving the overall system security.

AB Power grids are undergoing major changes due to rapid growth in renewable energy and improvements in battery technology. Prompted by the increasing complexity of power systems, decentralized IoT solutions are emerging, which arrange local communities into transactive microgrids. The core functionality of these solutions is to provide mechanisms for matching producers with consumers while ensuring system safety. However, there are multiple challenges that these solutions still face: privacy, trust, and resilience. The privacy challenge arises because the time series of production and consumption data for each participant is sensitive and may be used to infer personal information. Trust is an issue because a producer or consumer can renege on the promised energy transfer. Providing resilience is challenging due to the possibility of failures in the infrastructure that is required to support these market based solutions. In this paper, we develop a rigorous solution for transactive microgrids that addresses all three challenges by providing an innovative combination of MILP solvers, smart contracts, and publish-subscribe middleware within a framework of a novel distributed application platform, called Resilient Information Architecture Platform for Smart Grid. Towards this purpose, we describe the key architectural concepts, including fault tolerance, and show the trade-off between market efficiency and resource requirements.

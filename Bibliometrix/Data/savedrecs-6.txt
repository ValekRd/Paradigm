TI A Comparative Study of Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Deep Learning
SO MATHEMATICS
AB Bitcoin has recently received a lot of attention from the media and the public due to its recent price surge and crash. Correspondingly, many researchers have investigated various factors that affect the Bitcoin price and the patterns behind its fluctuations, in particular, using various machine learning methods. In this paper, we study and compare various state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as a deep neural network (DNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a convolutional neural network, a deep residual network, and their combinations for Bitcoin price prediction. Experimental results showed that although LSTM-based prediction models slightly outperformed the other prediction models for Bitcoin price prediction (regression), DNN-based models performed the best for price ups and downs prediction (classification). In addition, a simple profitability analysis showed that classification models were more effective than regression models for algorithmic trading. Overall, the performances of the proposed deep learning-based prediction models were comparable.

TI Blockchain-Enabled Charging Right Trading Among EV Charging Stations
SO ENERGIES
AB Increasing penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) gives rise to the challenges in the secure operation of power systems. The EV charging loads should be distributed among charging stations in a fair and incentive-compatible manner while ensuring that power transmission and transformation facilities are not overloaded. This paper first proposes a charging right (or charging power ration) trading mechanism and model based on blockchain. Considering all kinds of random factors of charging station loads, we use Monte Carlo modeling to determine the charging demand of charging stations in the future. Based on the charging demand of charging stations, a charging station needs to submit the charging demand for a future period. The blockchain first distributes initial charging right in a just manner and ensures the security of facilities. Given that the charging urgency and elasticity differences vary by charging stations, all charging stations then proceed with double auction and peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction of charging right. Bids and offers are cleared via double auctions if bids are higher than offers. The remaining bids and offers are cleared via the P2P market. Then, this paper designs the charging right allocation and trading platform and smart contract based on the Ethernet blockchain to ensure the safety of the distribution network (DN) and the transparency and efficiency of charging right trading. Simulation results based on the Ethereum private blockchain show the fairness and efficiency of the proposed mechanism and the effectiveness of the method and the mechanism.

TI BioWolf: A Sub-10-mW 8-Channel Advanced Brain-Computer Interface
   Platform With a Nine-Core Processor and BLE Connectivity
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS
CT 2nd International Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems (ISICAS)
CY AUG 29-30, 2019
CL Venice, ITALY
AB Advancements in digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning techniques have boosted the popularity of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where electroencephalography is a widely accepted method to enable intuitive human-machine interaction. Nevertheless, the evolution of such interfaces is currently hampered by the unavailability of embedded platforms capable of delivering the required computational power at high energy efficiency and allowing for a small and unobtrusive form factor. To fill this gap, we developed BioWolf, a highly wearable (40mm 20 mm 2 mm) BCI platform based on Mr. Wolf, a parallel ultra low power system-on-chip featuring nine RISC-V cores with DSP-oriented instruction set extensions. BioWolf also integrates a commercial 8-channel medical-grade analog-to-digital converter, and an ARM-Cortex M4 microcontroller unit (MCU) with bluetooth low-energy connectivity. To demonstrate the capabilities of the system, we implemented and tested a BCI featuring canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of steady-state visual evoked potentials. The system achieves an average information transfer rate of 1.46 b/s (aligned with the state-of-the-art of bench-top systems). Thanks to the reduced power envelope of the digital computational platform, which consumes less than the analog front-end, the total power budget is just 6.31mW, providing up to 38h operation (65mAh battery). To our knowledge, our design is the first to explore the significant energy boost of a parallel MCU with respect to single-core MCUs for CCA-based BCI.

TI Blockchain Governance Game
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB This paper deals with the design of the secure blockchain network framework to prevent damages from an attacker. The decentralized network design called the Blockchain Governance Game is a new hybrid theoretical model and provides a new stochastic game framework to find best strategies for preventing a network malfunction by attackers. Analytically tractable results are obtained by using the fluctuation theory and the mixed strategy game theory. These results enable to predict the moment of operations and deliver the optimal portion of backup nodes to protect the blockchain network. This research helps for whom considers the initial coin offering or launching new blockchain based services with enhancing the security features.

TI Assessing interoperability solutions for distributed ledgers
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Distributed ledgers (DLs), including blockchains, are gradually becoming an accepted technology. Almost all of these DLs are currently siloed and there is an increasing need for interaction. To fulfill this need, interoperability solutions have been proposed. However, DL interoperability has been scarcely researched and it is not always clear which properties these solutions have, nor which particular issues exist in such solutions.
   This paper describes a set of key properties with which interoperability solutions can be evaluated. Using these key properties, we systematically compare the two most common solutions and identify several issues, some of which cannot be solved by the solutions themselves. Finally, these properties can be used in practice to assess and compare interoperability solutions, and can be used to determine which kind of solution fits best. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Decomposing the persistence structure of Islamic and green
   crypto-currencies with nonlinear stepwise filtering
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB The multi-fractal chaotic dynamics of Islamic and Green crypto-currency series are investigated for the first time in econophysics literature. Specifically, we decompose and analyse the temporal signals of prices, returns, volume and volatility of Islamic and Green cryptos vis-a-vis conventional ones in a comparative manner. We introduce a multi-step resolution approach based on detrended fluctuation analysis, Generalized Hurst and Lyapunov exponents as well as fractionally integrated conditional heteroskedasticity. Moreover, various tests are employed to investigate the statistical significance of any (dis)similarities of long memory patterns, multi-fractality measures and chaotic dynamics observed among Islamic, Green and conventional crypto-currency markets. Our findings suggest that while the returns of Islamic and green crypto-currencies exhibit anti-persistent dynamics, their price, volatility and volume series embed high persistence compared to the conventional crypto-currencies. Further statistical testing indicates that the distributions of the chaotic parameter estimates are significantly different versus common cryptocurrencies, a fact that reveals heterogeneity in multi-fractality and long memory patterns. As the Islamic and Green cryptos exhibit a distinct and more profound chaotic behaviour compared to conventional ones, their short-term predictability could further induce financial agents.

TI Prospects of Legal Regulation of Crypto Economy and ICO in Russia and
   Other Countries
SO EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA
AB This article discusses the key issues of legal regulation of the crypto economy in some countries (USA, Switzerland, France, Russia, Belarus, Israel, and the EU as a whole). Special attention is paid to the legal regulation of ICO as a way to attract foreign investments. The statements of regulatory authorities of different countries are considered; the existing practice of ICO project regulation and the current state of the primary token placement market are analyzed; the aspects of the extraterritorial effect of the U.S. securities legislation are studied, and so are the key risks for the investor and the creator of an ICO project. A separate paragraph is devoted to the known methods used by law enforcement services (e.g. Europol) to fight money laundering and terrorism financing through criminal cryptocurrency transactions. As a result of the analysis, taking into account the current practice of combating money laundering, recommendations are made to change the relevant legislation. In addition, this article discusses the problems of legal uncertainty regarding the taxation of crypto assets. The authors analyzed the current legal framework in the Russian Federation aimed at regulating the turnover of crypto assets. In particular, the bill on digital financial assets was considered. The overall conclusion of the study is that, in general, Russia today has the opportunity to become one of the leaders in the new market. Russia ranks second in the world in the number of ICOs, and the country has launched a number of blockchain projects that are popular around the globe.

TI A Novel Debt-Credit Mechanism for Blockchain-Based Data-Trading in
   Internet of Vehicles
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB With the advancement and emergence of diverse network services in Internet of Vehicles (IoV), large volume of data are collected and stored, making data important properties. Data will be one of the most important commodities in the future blockchain-based IoV systems. However, efficiency challenges have been commonly found in blockchain-based data markets, which is mainly caused by transaction confirmation delays and the cold-start problems for new users. To address the efficiency challenges, we propose a secure, decentralized IoV data-trading system by exploiting the blockchain technology, and design an efficient debt-credit mechamism to support efficient data-trading in IoV. In the debt-credit mechanism, a vehicle with loan demand could loan from multivehicles by promising to pay interest and reward. In particular, we encourage loaning among vehicles by a motivation-based investing and pricing mechanism. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg game to maximize the profits of borrower vehicle and lender vehicles jointly. In the first stage, the borrower vehicle set the interest rate and reward for the loan as its pricing strategies. In the second stage, the lender vehicles decide on their investing strategies. We apply backward induction to analyze the subgame perfect equilibrium at each stage for both independent and uniform pricing schemes. We also validate the existence and uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium. The numerical results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed pricing schemes.

TI Blockchain-enabled supply chain: An experimental study
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB Despite Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have reduced the information asymmetry and increased the degree of interorganizational collaboration, the companies participating a supply chain are less inclined to share data when information is sensible and partners cannot be fully trusted. In such a context, Blockchain is a decentralized certificate authority that may provide economic and operational benefits but companies operating in a supply chain claim to have little knowledge about Blockchain due to its novelty and to the lack of use cases and application studies.
   In this work, a software connector has been designed and developed to connect an Ethereum-like blockchain with the enterprises' information systems to allow companies to share information with their partners with different levels of visibility and to check data authenticity, integrity and invariability over time through the blockchain, thus building trust. In order to explore the potential of deploying the blockchain in a supply chain, a simulation model has been developed to recreate the supply chain operations and integrated with the blockchain through the same software connector to carry out a scenario statistical analysis. Application results shows how blockchain technology is a convenient instrument to overcome collaboration and trust issues in a supply chain, to increase the supply chain overall performance, to minimize the negative consequences of information asymmetry over the echelons of a supply chain but also to discourage companies from any misconduct (e.g. counterfeiting data or low data accuracy).

TI On the Security Aspects of Internet of Things: A Systematic Literature
   Review
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) has gained increasing visibility among emerging technologies and undoubtedly changing our daily life. Its adoption is strengthened by the growth of connected devices (things) as shown in recent statistics. However, as the number of connected things grows, responsibility related to security aspects also needs to increase. For instance, cyberattacks might happen if simple authentication mechanisms are not implemented on IoT applications, or if access control mechanisms are weakly defined. Considering the relevance of the subject, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify and synthesize security issues in IoT discussed in scientific papers published within a period of 8 years. Our literature review focused on four main security aspects, namely authentication, access control, data protection, and trust. We believe that a study considering these topics has the potential to reveal important opportunities and trends related to IoT security. In particular, we aim to identify open issues and technological trends that might guide future studies in this field, thus providing useful material both to researchers and to managers and developers of IoT systems. In this paper, we describe the protocol adopted to perform the SLR and present the state-of-the-art on the field by describing the main techniques reported in the retrieved studies. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to compile information on a comprehensive set of security aspects in IoT. Moreover, we discuss the placement, in terms of architectural tiers, for deploying security techniques, in an attempt to provide guidelines to help design decisions of security solution developers. We summarize our results showing security trends and research gaps that can be explored in future studies.

TI ICS-BlockOpS: Blockchain for operational data security in industrial
   control system
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are the backbone of critical infrastructure found in power, water, manufacturing and other industries. An ICS controls a physical plant through the use of sensors and actuators. A Historian sits on a plant network and receives, parses, and saves data and commands transmitted over the network, across the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), sensors and actuators. This data has at least two uses. One use is to check for any process anomalies that may occur due to component failures and cyber attacks. The other use of this data, and the focus of this work, is to serve as critical input to off-line activities such as forensic analysis. A cyber attack on the Historian could jeopardize any forensic analysis be it for maintenance, or discovering an attack trail. In this work, a novel architecture, named ICS-BlockOpS, is proposed to secure plant operational data recorded in the Historian. ICS-BlockOpS is designed to enhance data security along two dimensions: immutability and redundancy. An integrity checking mechanism, in combination with blockchain, is used to ensure data integrity. Data redundancy is achieved by applying an efficient replication mechanism and enables data recovery after an attack. A prototype implementation of ICS-BlockOpS uses Ethereum blockchain in the local network as part of the tamper proofing mechanism. The implementation is in an operational six-stage water treatment plant. The underlying design ideas are generic and could be applied to other ICS as well. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain technology enabling the Physical Internet: A synergetic
   application framework
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB This paper proposes a Blockchain based conceptual framework that offers a solution for fundamental barriers of the Physical Internet concerning the exchange of value and physical assets in logistics networks and decentralized leadership structures. In recent years, the Physical Internet has received high interest by researchers and practitioners alike, as it aims for a paradigm shift towards economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable logistics. However, the implementation requires transformations in infrastructure, technology, and business models, which cannot be met by centralized solutions proposed by the literature. Therefore, this paper provides a decentralized approach based on Blockchain technology describing in detail the configuration of the Blockchain and the integration into the distributed network structures of the Physical Internet. Grounded on an industry case study and literature on the Physical Internet and Blockchain, a four-layered framework is derived and subsequently presented in form of an application use case, guiding researchers for further analysis and practitioners for adoption opportunities.

The research on e-commerce has grown rapidly and new concepts have emerged such as social commerce, platforms, and user-generated content. However, no overarching perspective has yet been formulated for distinguishing new content creator-based business models within e-commerce. The aim of this paper is therefore to characterize content creator-based business models by formulating a taxonomy of e- commerce based on a structured literature review of the concepts mentioned above. The results of our study point toward eight types of content creator-based business models. Our paper outlines theoretical and practical implications for the emerging phenomenon of content creator-based business, which we refer to as intellectual commerce. In addition, we describe 19 concepts related to Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and e-commerce.

TI Blockchain and the Tokenization of the Individual: Societal Implications
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB We are living in a world where the very systems upon which trust is based are being challenged by new and exciting paradigm shifts. Centralization whether in the form of governments, financial institutions, enterprises and organizations is simply being challenged because of the lack of trust associated with data governance often experienced in the form of data breaches or simply a monetization of our data without our permission and/or incentives to participate in this emerging decentralization of structures. We see this trust deficit challenging the very institutions we have depended on including but not limited to financial institutions, private enterprises or government bodies. A new "social contract" is required as we continuously evolve into more decentralized and self-governing (or semi self-governing) entities. We will see more development in digital sovereignty with the caveat that a governance model will need to be defined. This position paper will present evidence that supports the premise that blockchain and individual tokenization could provide a new social contract.

TI Ciphertext Sorting Search Scheme Based on B+ Tree Index Structure on
   Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB In order to overcome the problem that cloud storage is not trusted and the low efficiency of ciphertext retrieval in cloud storage, a searchable ciphertext sorting encryption scheme based on B+ tree on the block chain is proposed. Combined with the blockchain technology, the problem of establishing reliable trust in multiple parties that do not understand each other is solved. A vector space model is used to reduce the complexity of the text and an efficient text retrieval system is implemented. The index structure of the B+ tree is used to improve the retrieval of ciphertext transactions on the blockchain. The ranking of multi-keyword query results is realized by the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm. Under the random oracle model, it is proved that the scheme is adaptive and indistinguishable. Through the comparative analysis of efficiency, it is shown that the scheme achieves efficient ciphertext retrieval on the blockchain.

Employing social network analysis and sentiment analysis, this study investigates the Twitter-mediated communication behaviors among cryptocurrencies. This study determines whether a significant association exists between cryptocurrencies' Twitter networks and their credit scores. Data were drawn from the Twitter pages of several top cryptocurrencies. The results indicate that reply-mention networks had the densest structure, that the following-follower network structure was correlated with the reply-mention structure, and that the reply-mention and co-tweet networks were positively correlated. The results also indicate that cryptocurrencies' active networking strategies affected their credit scores and more importantly, that cryptocurrencies frequently linked with fellow currencies tended to have high credit scores.

TI Optimal b-values for diffusion kurtosis imaging of the liver and
   pancreas in MR examinations
SO PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
AB Purpose: The objective was to optimise the number of b-values for diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) of the liver and pancreas in MR examinations to ensure reliable results with the shortest possible acquisition time.
   Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers underwent DKI at 3.0 T Siemens Magnetom Skyra using 7 b-values (b = 0, 200, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000 s/mm(2)). The regions of interest (ROIs) were placed in the liver (right lobe, left lobe) and pancreas (head, tail). DKI parameters (Dapp, Kapp) for ROIs were calculated for 7 b-values utilising the nonlinear least-squares (NLLS) Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. All calculations were repeated for ten subsets of data, with the number of b-values reduced to 4. DKI parameters calculated for subsets were compared with parameters calculated for all 7 b-values.
   Results: The correlation coefficient between DKI parameters calculated for 7 b-values and subsets ranged from 0.65 to 1.00. The coefficient of variation (CoV) of DKI parameters calculated for a group of volunteers varied from 8% to 42% and was not affected by the reduction of the b-values number. Only one subset of data (b = 0, 500, 1500 and 2000 s/mm(2)) simultaneously met two criteria: no statistical difference (p < 0.05) from results obtained for 7 b-values and very good correlation with them.
   Conclusions: DKI acquisition with 4 b-values (b = 0, 500, 1500 and 2000 s/mm(2)), compared to DKI acquisition utilising 7 b-values, allowed for the reduction of acquisition time by 36%, without affecting the calculated DKI parameters.

AB Thermo-responsive shape memory polymers which are a class of important smart materials can recover permanent shape from temporary shape by simple thermal stimulus, but most of the polymers lack of biodegradability and biocompatibility. Poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) is a green degradable thermoplastic, however, only limited studies involve controlling its shape change. In the work, a new x-shaped copolymer with defined architecture has been devised by using tetramethyltetravinylcyclotetrasiloxane (D-4(vi)) as centronucleus and polytetrahydrofuran-co-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PTMG-co-PCL) as branch to achieve PLLA shape memory. When the weight ratio of DAPP and PLLA is 50/50, the composite exhibits good thermo-responsive shape memory capacity because a balance between T-m of the x-shaped polymer rand T-g of PLLA is kept. The shape fixation ratio is 84% at 15 degrees C, and the recovery ratio 94% at 55 degrees C. And the shape memory capability does not change evidently after the reversible spiral transition is repeated for 30 times. At the same time, the composite shows great flexibility. So the obtained composite is promising for medical and bionic devices, self-healing systems, self-assembly structures.

TI Secondary currency acceptance: Experimental evidence with a dual
   currency search model
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION
AB Motivated by the use of non-legal tender currencies in regions experiencing economic turmoil and by the growing use of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, I examine in a controlled, experimental laboratory setting, the acceptance of a secondary currency when a primary currency already circulates in an economy. The underlying model is an indivisible goods / indivisible money, dual currency search model similar to that in Kiyotaki and Wright (1993) and Curtis and Waller (2000). In such models, there are two pure Nash equilibria - total acceptance or total rejection of the secondary currency - and one unstable, mixed equilibrium. This mixed equilibrium is considered an artifact of the indivisibility of money and goods in the model and is often ignored. I find that when a significant friction - in this case the inability to barter - is introduced, the equilibrium tends towards complete acceptance of the secondary currency. Conversely, when barter is readily available to subjects, the equilibrium tends towards total rejection. As predicted by theory, the tendency towards one equilibrium or the other appears to be influenced by the mixed equilibrium and the related basins of attraction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI ENVISIONING A COMPULSORY-LICENSING SYSTEM FOR DIGITAL SAMPLES THROUGH
   EMERGENT TECHNOLOGIES
SO DUKE LAW JOURNAL
AB Despite the rapid development of modern creative culture, federal copyright law has remained largely stable, steeped in decades of tradition and history. For the most part, copyright finds strength in its stability, surviving the rise of recorded music, software programs, and, perhaps the most disruptive technology of our generation, the internet.
   On the other hand, copyright's resistance to change can be detrimental, as with digital sampling. Although sampling can be a highly creative practice, and although copyright purports to promote creativity, current copyright law often interferes with the practice of sampling. The result is a largely broken system: Those who can legally sample are usually able to do so because they are wealthy, influential, or both. Those who cannot legally sample often sample illegally.
   Many scholars have suggested statutory solutions to this problem. Arguably, the most workable solutions are rooted in compulsory licenses. Unfortunately, implementing these solutions is practically difficult.
   Two recent developments invite us to revisit these proposals. First, with the passage of the Music Modernization Act ("MMA"), Congress has evinced a willingness to "modernize" parts of copyright law. Second, emergent technologies-from the MMA's musical-works database to blockchain to smart contracts-can be leveraged to more easily implement a compulsory-licensing solution. This time around, rather than simply discuss why this solution is favorable, this Note will focus on how it can be implemented.

TI Prostate cancer aggressive prediction: preponderant diagnostic
   performances of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging and
   diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) beyond ADC at 3.0 T scanner with
   gleason score at final pathology
SO ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY
AB Purpose To explore the preponderant diagnostic performances of IVIM and DKI in predicting the Gleason score (GS) of prostate cancer. Methods Diffusion-weighted imaging data were postprocessed using monoexponential, lVIM and DK models to quantitate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), molecular diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion-related diffusion coefficient (Dstar), perfusion fraction (F), apparent diffusion for Gaussian distribution (Dapp), and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to explore the relationship between those parameters and the GS, Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to compare the above parameters between the different groups, and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the differential diagnosis ability. The interpretation of the results is in view of histopathologic tumor tissue composition. Results The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of ADC, F, D, Dapp, and Kapp in differentiating GS <= 3 + 4 and GS > 3 + 4 PCa were 0.744 (95% CI 0.581-0.868), 0.726 (95% CI 0.563-0.855), 0.732 (95% CI 0.569-0.860), and 0.752 (95% CI 0.590-0.875), 0.766 (95% CI 0.606-0.885), respectively, and those in differentiating GS <= 7 and GS > 7 PCa were 0.755 (95% CI 0.594-0.877), 0.734 (95% CI 0.571-0.861), 0.724 (95% CI0.560-0.853), and 0.716 (95% CI 0.552-0.847), 0.828 (95% CI 0.676-0.929), respectively. All the P values were less than 0.05. There was no significant difference in the AUC for the detection of different GS groups by using those parameters. Conclusion Both the IVIM and DKI models are beneficial to predict GS of PCa and indirectly predict its aggressiveness, and they have a comparable diagnostic performance with each other as well as ADC.

TI Neural-Blockchain-Based Ultrareliable Caching for Edge-Enabled UAV
   Networks
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) reduces the computational distance between the source and the servers by fortifying near-user site evaluations of data for expedited communications, using caching. Caching provides ephemeral storage of data on designated servers for low-latency transmissions. However, with the network following a hierarchical layout, even the near-user site evaluations can be impacted by the overheads associated with maintaining a perpetual connection and other factors (e.g., those relating to the reliability of the underpinning network). Prior solutions study reliability as a factor of throughput, delays, jitters, or delivery ratio. However, with modern networks supporting high data rates, a current research trend is in ultrareliability. The latter is defined in terms of availability, connectivity, and survivability. Thus, in this paper, we focus on the ultrareliable communication in MEC. Specifically, in our setting, we use drones as on-demand nodes for efficient caching. While some existing solutions use cache-enabled drones, they generally focus only on the positioning problem rather than factors relating to ultrareliable communications. We present a novel neural-blockchain-based drone-caching approach, designed to ensure ultrareliability and provide a flat architecture (via blockchain). This neural-model fortifies an efficient transport mechanism, since blockchain maintains high reliability amongst the peers involved in the communications. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the proposed approach scores well in the following metrics: the probability of connectivity reaches 0.99; energy consumption is decreased by 60.34%; the maximum failure rate is affected by 13.0%; survivability is greater than 0.90; reliability reaches 1.0 even for a large set of users.

TI Privacy-Preserving Support Vector Machine Training Over Blockchain-Based
   Encrypted IoT Data in Smart Cities
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used in many smart city sectors, where a huge amount of data is gathered from various (IoT) devices. As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme.

TI Legal Challenges of Cryptocurrencies: Isn't It Time to Regulate the
   Intermediaries?
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
AB In only one decade, cryptocurrencies have witnessed significant growth, with Bitcoin being the most dominant one. They are not efficient payment methods, although they bring some benefits linked to the underlying technology they use (Blockchain). In reality, they function more as investment assets than as payment instruments and pose various risks, which are very similar to those encountered on capital markets (price volatility, fraud, market manipulation). In order to deal with these risks, regulation should apply to intermediaries who provide services in relation to cryptocurrencies, such as crypto wallets, operation of crypto exchanges and brokerage. To this end, the European legislator should consider two options. It could, on the one hand, bring cryptocurrency service providers within the scope of the existing financial services regime and thus modify MIFID II in order to include cryptocurrencies in the list of financial instruments. The European legislator could also, on the other hand, aim at creating a new appropriate and proportionate regime that draws on the existing one. Insofar as the existing regulatory framework was not designed with cryptocurrencies in mind and as some of the current rules may not be tailored to the specificities of these assets, the second option is preferable.

TI Analysis and Comparison of Bitcoin and S and P 500 Market Features Using
   HMMs and HSMMs
SO INFORMATION
AB We implement hidden Markov models (HMMs) and hidden semi-Markov models (HSMMs) on Bitcoin/US dollar (BTC/USD) with the aim of market phase detection. We make analogous comparisons to Standard and Poor's 500 (S and P 500), a benchmark traditional stock index and a protagonist of several studies in finance. Popular labels given to market phases are "bull", "bear", "correction", and "rally". In the first part, we fit HMMs and HSMMs and look at the evolution of hidden state parameters and state persistence parameters over time to ensure that states are correctly classified in terms of market phase labels. We conclude that our modelling approaches yield positive results in both BTC/USD and the S and P 500, and both are best modelled via four-state HSMMs. However, the two assets show different regime volatility and persistence patterns-BTC/USD has volatile bull and bear states and generally weak state persistence, while the S and P 500 shows lower volatility on the bull states and stronger state persistence. In the second part, we put our models to the test of detecting different market phases by devising investment strategies that aim to be more profitable on unseen data in comparison to a buy-and-hold approach. In both cases, for select investment strategies, four-state HSMMs are also the most profitable and significantly outperform the buy-and-hold strategy.

TI Blockchain as a solution to the problem of illegal timber trade between
   Russia and China: SWOT analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL FORESTRY REVIEW
AB Prolific illegal timber trade between Russia and China cannot be stemmed by present certification schemes and Russian governmental strategies. Blockchain could present a new technological opportunity, simultaneously addressing illegal logging, regulating timber trade and meeting the needs of environmentally-sensitive markets. SWOT analysis of blockchain applicability in Russian-Chinese timber trade is presented. Decentralisation based on smart contracts could ensure timber supply chain transparency through each log cryptographic encryption. However, it is considered complicated as cryptocurrency (on which trade depends) is beyond the legislative sphere of both countries and energy demands are enormous. Beyond cryptocurrency prohibition, huge businesses and governments cannot accept blockchain for international trade because of transparency and cost risks. Digitalisation through blockchain implementation could provide a highly transparent, non-editable system to handle decentralised big data characteristic of the forestry economy, realise Industry 4.0 and develop the "China-Mongolia-Russia" economic corridor. Fundamentally, a workable Russian-Chinese Government-Science-Business model must be cultivated for effective blockchain implementation.

TI Blockchain Technology for Applications in Internet of Things-Mapping
   From System Design Perspective
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Internet of Things (IoT) refers to networks with billions of physical devices for collecting, sharing, and utilizing data in the virtual world. Most of IoT applications centralize security assurance in creating, authenticating, transferring, or delating system components. However, the centralization exposes its limitations to meet security needs of a rapidly growing number of things world-widely. How to scale up the applications with assured security becomes a critical challenge. Blockchain technology (BCT) is a promising solution to provide security and protect privacy in a large scale; especially, smart contracts offer opportunities to improve the reliability of IoT applications. Smart contracts establish trusts for both of data and executed processes. Recently, many literature surveys and positioning articles have been published on the integration of BCT with IoT, but they are limited to superficial discussions of technical potentials, and very few of them have a thorough exploration of the challenges in developing BCT for IoT at technical levels. This paper uses the system design approach to scrutinize the state of the art of study on BCT-based applications and clarify critical research areas of enabling BCT for security assurance: 1) the relations of BCT and IoT are modeled and discussed; 2) the needs of eliminating threats in IoT-based applications are defined as functional requirements (FRs), existing works on enabling technologies of BCT are defined as the physical solutions (PSs); and 3) the mappings between FRs and PSs are established to identify the limitations and the critical areas for the applications of BCT in large-scale distributed environment.

AB In the last few years, we have been witnessing the convergence of the physical with the digital world. The Internet of Things (IoT) is progressing at a fast pace, and IoT devices are becoming pervasive in our physical environments, bringing the vision of Intelligent Environments closer to reality. At the same time, the newly-introduced blockchain technology is offering for the first time ever cryptographically proven trust based on a set of mutually untrusted nodes. Blockchain technology thus has the potential to become a key component of many IoT systems, offering them an unprecedented level of accountability, transparency, and reliability. This paper first lays out the principles on which blockchain systems are operating, along with descriptions of the most noteworthy blockchain implementations. It then presents a number of systems through which blockchains may interact with external systems and third-party data sources. Finally, it provides a survey of the state-of-the-art blockchain-based systems targeting IoT applications.

TI Decentralized Autonomous Organizations: Concept, Model, and Applications

AB Decentralized autonomy is a long-standing research topic in information sciences and social sciences. The self-organization phenomenon in natural ecosystems, the Cyber Movement Organizations (CMOs) on the Internet, and the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI), and so on, can all be regarded as its early manifestations. In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technology has spawned the emergence of the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organization [DAO, sometimes labeled as Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC)], which is a new organization form that the management and operational rules are typically encoded on blockchain in the form of smart contracts, and can autonomously operate without centralized control or third-party intervention. DAO is expected to overturn the traditional hierarchical management model and significantly reduce organizations & x2019; costs on communication, management, and collaboration. However, DAO still faces many challenges, such as security and privacy issue, unclear legal status, and so on. In this article, we strive to present a systematic introduction of DAO, including its concept and characteristics, research framework, typical implementations, challenges, and future trends. Especially, a novel reference model for DAO which employs a five-layer architecture is proposed. This article is aimed at providing helpful guidance and reference for future research efforts.

TI FSSE: Forward secure searchable encryption with keyed-block chains
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Nowadays, people widely use Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) to design the equality query and range query operation for encrypted database systems. A recent attack points out forward privacy is the necessary security goal which, however, has not been achieved by most of SSE schemes. Motivated by this security goal, we propose a forward secure SSE scheme whose index structure consists of keyed-block chains. The proposed scheme is efficient since the keyed-block chain can be implemented by symmetric encryption primitive and the scheme also supports both add and delete operations in one instance. We further employ the one-way permutation function to reduce the storage on the client side. Experiments show that our scheme is 4 x, 300 x and 300 x faster than the state-of-the-art forward private SSE scheme (CCS 2016) in search, update and token generation, respectively.

SO IEEE ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION LETTERS
AB Event data recording is crucial in robotics research, providing prolonged insights into a robot's situational understanding, progression of behavioral state, and resulting outcomes. Such recordings are invaluable when debugging complex robotic applications or profiling experiments ex post facto. As robotic developments mature into production, both the roles and requirements of event logging will broaden, to include serving as evidence for auditors and regulators investigating accidents or fraud. Given the growing number of high profile public incidents involving self-driving automotives resulting in fatality and regulatory policy making, it is paramount that the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of such event logs are maintained to ensure accountability. Being mobile cyber-physical systems, robots present new threats, and vulnerabilities beyond traditional IT: unsupervised physical system access or postmortem collusion between robot and OEM could result in the truncation or alteration of prior records. In this letter, we address immutablization of log records via integrity proofs and distributed ledgers with special considerations for mobile and public service robot deployments.

TI An intelligent Agriculture Network Security System Based on Private
   Blockchains
SO JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS
AB Countries around the world are nowadays actively promoting development in intelligent agriculture. Each of them must develop a specific plan tailored to environmental farming indices of each individual farm, and such information would be both important and sensitive. This is why information in intelligent agriculture requires protection from network security to ensure data privacy and integrity. This study proposes applying dark web technology to ensure the privacy of blockchains and servers. The study will monitor packet transmission frequency in intelligent agriculture to prevent distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks. The main features of system include: (1) An identity authentication mechanism, (2) secure transmission of information, (3) establishment of private blockchains, (4) a faster, improved authentication system for blockchain information, and (5) resistance against DDOS attacks. The proposed scheme can safeguard network security for the IoT as well as the servers by way of applying dark web technology, which can avoid exposure of blockchains and server ID addresses and thus in turn lower the risks of DDOS attack damages. Experiment results indicate that the application of lightweight encryption of proposed scheme does indeed improve the authentication speed while also satisfying requirements of network security.

TI A Comprehensive Survey of Blockchain: From Theory to IoT Applications
   and Beyond
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB As an innovated and revolutionized technology, blockchain has been applied in many fields, such as cryptocurrency, food traceability, identity management, or even market prediction. To discover its great potential, both industry and academia have paid great attention to it and numerous researches have been conducted. Based on the literature and industry whitepapers, in this survey, we unroll and structure the blockchain related discoveries and scientific results in many aspects. Particularly, we classify blockchain technologies into four layers and carry out a comprehensive study on the consensus strategies, the network, and the applications of blockchain. Different blockchain applications are put into the corresponding categories based on the fields, especially in Internet of Things (IoT). When introducing each layer, we not only organize and summarize the related works, but also discuss the fundamental issues and future research directions. We hope this survey could shed some light on the research of blockchain and serve as a guide for further studies.

TI Healthchain: A Blockchain-Based Privacy Preserving Scheme for
   Large-Scale Health Data
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB With the dramatically increasing deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), remote monitoring of health data to achieve intelligent healthcare has received great attention recently. However, due to the limited computing power and storage capacity of IoT devices, users' health data are generally stored in a centralized third party, such as the hospital database or cloud, and make users lose control of their health data, which can easily result in privacy leakage and single-point bottleneck. In this paper, we propose Healthchain, a large-scale health data privacy preserving scheme based on blockchain technology, where health data are encrypted to conduct fine-grained access control. Specifically, users can effectively revoke or add authorized doctors by leveraging user transactions for key management. Furthermore, by introducing Healthchain, both IoT data and doctor diagnosis cannot be deleted or tampered with so as to avoid medical disputes. Security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed Healthchain is applicable for smart healthcare system.

TI How persistent and dynamic inter-dependent are pricing of Bitcoin to
   other cryptocurrencies before and after 2017/18 crash?
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The present paper investigates persistence and inter-dependence of bitcoin on other popular alternative coins. We employ fractional integration approach in our analysis of persistence, while a more recent fractional cointegration technique in VAR set-up, proposed by Johansen (2008), is used to investigate inter-dependence in pricing of the paired cryptocurrencies. Having partitioned the series into periods before and after the 2017/2018 cryptocurrency price crash, as determined by Bitcoin pricing, we obtain some interesting results. Higher persistence of price shocks is observed after the crash, which is probably due to speculative transactions among cryptocurrency traders, and more evidences of non-mean reversions are revealed, implying chances of further price fall in cryptocurrencies. Cointegration relationships between bitcoin and alternative coins exist in both periods, with weak correlations observed mostly in the post-crash period. Our results further indicate the possibility of market efficiency between pair of cryptocurrency. Generally, we hope the findings will serve as guide to investors in cryptocurrency markets.

TI A Framework for Hoax News Detection and Analyzer used Rule-based Methods
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Currently, the era where social media can present various facilities can answer the needs of the community for information and utilization for socio-economic interests. But the other impact of the presence of social media opens an ample space for the existence of information or hoax news about an event that is troubling the public. The hoax also provides cynical provocation, which is inciting hatred, anger, incitement to many people, directly influencing behavior so that it responds as desired by the hoax makers. Fake news is playing an increasingly dominant role in spreading Misinformation by influencing people's Perceptions or knowledge to distort their awareness and decision-making. A framework is develope dataset collection of hoax gathered using web crawlers from several websites, using classification techniques. This hoax news will be categorized into several detection parameters including, page URL, title hoax news, publish date, author, and content. Matching each word hoax using the similarity algorithm to produce the accuracy of the hoax news uses the rule-based detection method. Experiments were carried out on eleven thousand-hoax news used as training datasets and testing data sets; this data set for validation using similarity algorithms, to produce the highest accuracy of hoax text similarity. In this study, each hoax news will label into four categories, namely, Fact, Hoax, Information, Unknown. Contributions propose Automatic detection of hoax news, Automatic Multilanguage Detection, and a collection of datasets that we gather ourselves and validation that results in four categories of hoax news that have measured in terms of text similarity using similarity techniques. Further research can be continued by adding objects hate speech, black campaign, blockchain technique to ward off hoaxes, or can produce algorithms that produce better text accuracy.

TI Double-Spending With a Sybil Attack in the Bitcoin Decentralized Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB A double-spend attack is one of the major security issues in most blockchain systems, but it is difficult to successfully launch unless an adversary has massive computing power. In this paper, we introduce a new attack model that combines a double-spend attack with a Sybil attack in the Bitcoin network. We present analysis results that a double-spending attacker can make a block propagation delay by conducting Sybil attacks and increase the probability of winning the mining race, thus successfully launching the double-spend attack. We develop the probability of success of this new attack in mathematics forms and analyze this attack model from the perspective of economics. We present the attacker's break-even point in various situations and demonstrate the effect of the proposed attack.

TI Coalition Game-Based Computation Resource Allocation for Wireless
   Blockchain Networks
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Public blockchain network (PBN) has been widely used in wired networks such as bitcoin network, in which proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm is deployed among miners to reach consensus on users data during the mining process. However, the PoW consensus mechanism is computation-consuming which obstacles the application of PBN in wireless mobile networks since most Internet of Things/mobile devices (IMDs) are resource limited. Recently, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been regarded as a promising technology which can allow IMDs to offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes. Although IMDs can offload their computation tasks to the edge nodes, there is still lots of competition among enormous solo mining IMDs when reaching consensus. In this paper, we first formulate the computation resource allocation problem of PBN from the viewpoint of coalition game theory under the MEC environment. Then, we propose a coalition formation game-based algorithm to maximize the system sum utility and take both the individual profit of IMD and coalition profit into consideration. Furthermore, we prove the proposed algorithm converges to a Nash-stable partition in a fast convergence rate and finally reaches the near-optimal solution with low computational complexity. The simulation results demonstrate the optimality and convergence of the proposed algorithm, and the proposed algorithm outperforms other schemes in terms of system sum profit and ratio of rewarded IMDs to overall IMDs.

TI Consortium Blockchain-Based Microgrid Market Transaction Research
SO ENERGIES
AB The microgrid trading market can effectively solve the problem of in-situ consumption of distributed energy and reduce the impact of distributed generation (DG) on the grid. However, the traditional microgrid trading model has some shortcomings, such as high operation cost and poor security. Therefore, in this paper, a microgrid market trading model was developed using consortium blockchain technology and Nash game equilibrium theory. Firstly, blockchain container is used to authenticate the users who want to participate in the transaction. Then, the pricing system collects and integrates transaction requests submitted by users, then formulates transaction pricing strategy of microgrid using Nash equilibrium theory. Finally, the price, trading volume, and user information are submitted to the blockchain container for transaction matching to achieve the transaction. After the transaction is completed, its related information is recorded in the hyperledger and the dispatch system is called. The scene simulation was implemented on Fabric 1.1 platform and the results analyzed. Results show that the trading model proposed in this paper greatly reduces the cost of electricity purchase and improves the benefits of electricity sales. Besides, the model is far more capable of handling transactions than the models based on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

TI Blockchain based privacy-preserving software updates with
   proof-of-delivery for Internet of Things
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB A large number of loT devices are connected via the Internet. However, most of these loT devices are generally not perfect-by-design even have security weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Thus, it is essential to update these loT devices securely, patching their vulnerabilities and protecting the safety of the involved users. Existing studies deliver secure and reliable updates based on blockchain network which serves as the transmission network. However, these approaches could compromise users privacy when updating the loT devices.
   In this paper, we propose a new blockchain based privacy-preserving software update protocol, which delivers secure and reliable updates with an incentive mechanism while protects the privacy of involved users. A vendor delivers the updates and makes a commitment by using smart contract to provide financial incentive to the transmission nodes who deliver the updates to its loT devices. A transmission node can get financial incentive by providing a proof-of-delivery. In order to obtain the proof-of-delivery, the transmission node uses double authentication preventing signature (DAPS) to carry out fair exchange. Specifically, the transmission node uses the DAPS to exchange an attribute based signature (ABS) of one loT device. Then, it uses the ABS as proof-of-delivery to receive financial incentives. Generally, to generate an ABS, the loT device has to execute complex computations which is intolerable for resource limited devices. We propose a concrete outsourced attribute-based signature (OABS) scheme to overcome the weakness. Then, we prove the security of the proposed OABS and the protocol. Finally, we implement smart contract in Solidity to demonstrate the validity of the proposed protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We find that cryptocurrencies with small market value tend to perform better in the future, which challenges the Efficient Market Hypothesis. The size effect is stable over the sample period and robust to the sample size. The prior returns and liquidity also have an impact on the size effect. In addition, our findings provide practical implications for cryptocurrency investors.

SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This study examines changes in the value of Bitcoin after the BREXIT and US Presidential elections in 2016 to determine whether it and other cryptocurrencies experienced value changes associated with the vote outcomes. For comparative purposes, Bitcoin is also compared to currencies such as the Great Britain Pound, Mexican Peso and Special Drawing Rights to determine whether Bitcoin values change like currencies. Some evidence showed changes in the value of Bitcoin were weakly similar to store-of-wealth commodities like gold and silver. Overall, the election-window volatility of cryptocurrencies was much higher than the preceding one-year average for the BREXIT vote but less volatile than the one-year average for the US election vote.

TI Amifampridine for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome
SO EXPERT REVIEW OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY
AB Introduction: The present status of amifampridine (AFP) for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is reviewed. Areas covered: All relevant literature identified through a PubMed search under treatment of LEMS, aminopyridine, and amifampridine are reviewed. An expert opinion on AFP was formulated. Expert opinion: AFPs, 3,4-DAP and 3,4-DAPP, are the most studied drugs in neuromuscular diseases. Randomized and non-randomized studies showed the most effective drug as symptomatic medication for LEMS. AFPs are safe and tolerable. Thus, AFPs should be the drug of choice for the symptomatic treatment in LEMS. As long as the daily dose is less than 80 mg a day, there is no concern for the serious side-reaction, seizure. Because of short-acting drug effects, it should be given three or four times a day. Peri-oral and finger paresthesia, the most common side-reaction, is accepted as a sign of drug-intake by many patients. Gastro-intestinal side reactions, the next common side-reaction of AFPs, are tolerable. AFPs are also the drug of choice and life-saving for LEMS crisis. For the long-term usage, it is proven to be safe and AFPs can be supplemented with liberal amount of pyridostigmine to sustain a symptomatic improvement without any undue side-reaction.

TI Benefits of Blockchain Initiatives for Value-Based Care: Case Study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: The potential of blockchain technology to achieve strategic goals, such as value-based care, is increasingly being recognized by both researchers and practitioners. However, current research and practices lack comprehensive approaches for evaluating the benefits of blockchain applications.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a framework for holistically assessing the performance of blockchain initiatives in providing value-based care by extending the existing balanced scorecard (BSC) evaluation framework.
   Methods: Based on a review of the literature on value-based health care, blockchain technology, and methods for evaluating initiatives in disruptive technologies, we propose an extended BSC method for holistically evaluating blockchain applications in the provision of value-based health care. The proposed method extends the BSC framework, which has been extensively used to measure both financial and nonfinancial performance of organizations. The usefulness of our proposed framework is further demonstrated via a case study.
   Results: We describe the extended BSC framework, which includes five perspectives (both financial and nonfinancial) from which to assess the appropriateness and performance of blockchain initiatives in the health care domain.
   Conclusions: The proposed framework moves us toward a holistic evaluation of both the financial and nonfinancial benefits of blockchain initiatives in the context of value-based care and its provision.

SO JOURNAL OF FUTURES MARKETS
AB BitMEX is the largest unregulated bitcoin derivatives exchange, listing contracts suitable for leverage trading and hedging. Using minute-by-minute data, we examine its price discovery and hedging effectiveness. We find that BitMEX derivatives lead prices on major bitcoin spot exchanges. Bid-ask spreads, interexchange spreads, and relative trading volumes are important determinants of price discovery. Further analysis shows that BitMEX derivatives have positive net spillover effects, are informationally more efficient than bitcoin spot prices, and serve as effective hedges against spot price volatility. Our evidence suggests that regulators prioritize the investigation of the legitimacy of BitMEX and its contracts.

TI A split-and-transfer flow based entropic centrality
SO PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB The notion of entropic centrality measures how central a node is in terms of how uncertain the destination of a flow starting at this node is: the more uncertain the destination, the more well connected and thus central the node is deemed. This implicitly assumes that the flow is indivisible, and at every node, the flow is transferred from one edge to another. The contribution of this paper is to propose a split-and-transfer flow model for entropic centrality, where at every node, the flow can actually be arbitrarily split across choices of neighbours. We show how to map this to an equivalent transfer entropic centrality set-up for the ease of computation, and carry out three case studies (an airport network, a cross-shareholding network and a Bitcoin transactions subnetwork) to illustrate the interpretation and insights linked to this new notion of centrality.

AB Environmental pollution is a major issue for public health and safety. Measurement of fine-grain spatiotemporal distribution of pollution for a micro-environment is necessary to explore the correlations among environment, health, and behavior. The continuous advancement of miniature environmental sensing devices, microelectronics, and communication technologies propelled the development of wearable devices for environmental monitoring applications. This type of devices are able to acquire high-resolution objective geo-tagged data. The aim of this review is to summarize the contemporary research and developments on wearable devices intended for environmental Internet of Things (IoT) applications. This paper provides comprehensive descriptions of the state-of-the-art wearable environmental monitoring systems (WEMS) and compares them in terms of sensing and communication technologies. The reviewed WEMS are mainly classified into two groups based on whether they used commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) sensors or self-developed sensors. The first group is further categorized based on their wearability. In line with this, a consolidated description is provided by presenting the main features of the available wearable environmental monitoring devices from the industry. In addition, several issues are identified for WEMS and future research directions are provided. Thus, this review paper examines the current research on WEMS and can serve as a reference for the researchers and developers to provide perspectives toward future research improvements.

This creates a demand for an ultra-short tenor interest rate curve that is updated in real-time. Our paper develops a practical market model for the equilibrium intraday interest rates which provides market makers adequate incentives to attenuate flash crashes. Our model suggests that the intraday CHF interest rates should have been highly negative during the flash crash of EURCHF on 15 January 2015, which could potentially stop the long CHF short EUR strategy and reduce the severity of the crash.

TI Safe havens in the face of Presidential election uncertainty: A
   comparison between Bitcoin, oil and precious metals
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB Even though the empirical literature on safe haven properties of different assets with respect to financial risks is increasing, their abilities to safeguard against political risks has not been the subject of large empirical investigations. This paper uses an Empirical Mode Decomposition-based approach to look into the time-varying role of different assets (in particular, oil, precious metals and Bitcoin) as a safe haven against U.S. stocks in times of heightened uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Our results suggest that oil can act as an effective safe haven against political risk exposure; but such property varies over time. The abilities of gold and silver to provide positive returns during downturns have been also documented in the medium-and the long-term. Bitcoin also serves as a safe haven against U.S. stock losses but in the short-term. These findings provide useful and relevant information to investors to help ensure better asset allocation in an uncertain environment.

TI The future of forecasting for renewable energy
SO WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Forecasting for wind and solar renewable energy is becoming more important as the amount of energy generated from these sources increases. Forecast skill is improving, but so too is the way forecasts are being used. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the state-of-the-art of forecasting wind and solar energy. We describe approaches in statistical and physical modeling for time scales from minutes to days ahead, for both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting. Our focus changes then to consider the future of forecasting for renewable energy. We discuss recent advances which show potential for great improvement in forecast skill. Beyond the forecast itself, we consider new products which will be required to aid decision making subject to risk constraints. Future forecast products will need to include probabilistic information, but deliver it in a way tailored to the end user and their specific decision making problems. Businesses operating in this sector may see a change in business models as more people compete in this space, with different combinations of skills, data and modeling being required for different products. The transaction of data itself may change with the adoption of blockchain technology, which could allow providers and end users to interact in a trusted, yet decentralized way. Finally, we discuss new industry requirements and challenges for scenarios with high amounts of renewable energy. New forecasting products have the potential to model the impact of renewables on the power system, and aid dispatch tools in guaranteeing system security.

SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Blockchain is a key technology that enables cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, etc. In recent years, researchers have ventured into tapping the potential of blockchain-based ecosystems beyond cryptocurrencies. This paper explores the convergence of blockchain with the Internet of things (IoT) and its improved versions like software-defined network (SDN)-based IoT, which are upcoming technologies in the area. This paper gives a brief description of the IoT and its challenges, especially the security aspects. It also discusses how blockchain concept can further resolve these challenges on the SDN-based IoT platform. This paper first discussed the evolution of conventional IoT to the SDN-based IoT, which can resolve many drawbacks of a conventional IoT system. Also, it is focused on how the concept of blockchain can be converged with SDN-based IoT system to further improve its security aspects. Although the convergence of these different technologies has resulted into many advantages, many associated challenges still remain. This paper highlighted these challenges and opportunities to discover many other research issues that need to be resolved. The details of current literature on the same issue has also been highlighted in this paper.

TI Jointgraph: A DAG-based efficient consensus algorithm for consortium
   blockchains
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB The blockchain is a distributed ledger that records all transactions and operations in a shared manner. Public blockchains such as Bitcoin realize decentralization at the cost of mining overhead, which is not suitable for real-life scenarios requiring high throughput. Techniques such as the consortium blockchain improve efficiency through partial decentralization. However, the consensus algorithms used in the existing state-of-the-art consortium blockchains face many challenges when dealing with commercial applications. For example, the high communication overhead hinders the scalability of PBFT-based consensus algorithms even though they are efficient at small scale. Hashgraph, one of the most popular Directed Acyclic Graph-based (DAG-based) consensus algorithms, achieves good performance in scalability; however, it does not allow users' dynamic participation. To deal with these challenges, we propose Jointgraph, a Byzantine fault-tolerance consensus algorithm for consortium blockchains based on DAG. In Jointgraph, transactions are packed into events and validated by no less than 2/3 of all members. A supervisor is introduced in our design, who monitors member behaviors and improves consensus efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that Jointgraph outperforms Hashgraph in both throughput and latency.

TI Diffusion of blockchain technology Insights from academic literature and
   social media analytics
SO JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Although blockchain is often discussed, its actual diffusion seems to be varying for different industries. The purpose of this paper is to explore the blockchain technology diffusion in different industries through a combination of academic literature and social media (Twitter). Design/methodology/approach The insights derived from the academic literature and social media have been used to classify industries into five stages of the innovation-decision process, namely, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation (Rogers, 1995). Findings Blockchain is found to be diffused in almost all industries, but the level of diffusion varies. The analysis highlights that manufacturing industry is at the knowledge stage. Further public administration is at persuasion stage. Subsequently, transportation, communications, electric, gas and sanitary services and trading industry had reached to the decision stage. Then, services industries have reached to implementation stage while finance, insurance and real estate industries are the innovators of blockchain technologies and have reached the confirmation stage of innovation-decision process. Practical implications - Actual implementations of blockchain technology are still in its infancy stage for most of the industries. The findings suggest that specific industries are developing specific blockchain applications. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge this is the first study which is using social media data for investigating the diffusion of blockchain in industries. The results show that the combination of Twitter and academic literature analysis gives better insights into diffusion than a single data source.

TI Blockchains and the ?Chains of Empire?: Contextualizing Blockchain,
   Cryptocurrency, and Neoliberalism in Puerto Rico
SO DESIGN AND CULTURE
AB Although blockchain is often posed as a revolutionary and disruptive technology, its politics and socio-technical configurations often align with aims to maintain the status quo, and/or aims to concentrate wealth and to make existing powers more efficient. I empirically describe how colonial-contingent, neoliberal economic policies in Puerto Rico have incentivized the techno-capitalist industries of cryptocurrency and blockchain. Portions of the archipelago are being re-made into a so-called ?crypto-utopia? to satisfy the desires of new settlers in a new form of crypto-colonialism. Puerto Rican government organizations, institutions, and businesses are also engaging blockchain technology with differing intents, all using rhetoric as a covert design tool. In this paper I will focus on blockchain and cryptocurrency as neoliberal and libertarian technologies adopted by governmental agencies, businesses, organizations, and individuals, as well as efforts of resistance through alternative, decolonial design.

TI Blockchain technology in commercial real estate transactions
SO JOURNAL OF PROPERTY INVESTMENT & FINANCE
AB Purpose The transaction process of an office building is known to be time consuming and inefficient, in part due to the lack of market transparency. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the development of a blockchain application that can improve the transaction process of office buildings in the Netherlands. Design/methodology/approach Conducting design science research, the current transaction process of an office building and status quo of blockchain technology in real estate is investigated. Subsequently, multiple parties are interviewed to define major pain points within the process. The interview findings are used to design a blockchain solution which overcomes the aforementioned pain points. After designing, the interviewees are asked again to pragmatically validate the proposed model. Findings One of the major pain points identified concerning the transaction process of an office building is that it is difficult to define the characteristics of a property, due to lack of data structure and quality. The proposed application improves the way specific assets are understood by structuring physical and contractual information in one place and guarantees the quality of the data by using the blockchain mechanisms. Practical implications - A blockchain application is proposed, which can improve the transaction process of an office building. Originality/value Recent studies indicate that blockchain technology could lead to improvements in efficiency, transparency and therefore trust within the transaction process. Therefore, the proposed application is of value for the future of real estate data management and the transaction process.

TI MPC for Optimized Energy Exchange between Two Renewable-Energy Prosumers
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Renewable energy and information technologies are changing electrical energy distribution, favoring a move towards distributed production and trading between many buyers and sellers. There is new potential for trading between prosumers, entities which both consume and produce energy in small quantities. This work explores the optimization of energy trading between two prosumers, each of which consists of a load, renewable supply, and energy storage. The problem is described within a model predictive control (MPC) framework, which includes a single objective function to penalize undesirable behavior, such as the use of energy from a utility company. MPC integrates future predictions of supply and demand into current dispatch decisions. The control system determines energy flows between each renewable supply and load, battery usage, and transfers between the two prosumers. At each time step, future predictions are used to create an optimized power dispatch strategy between the system prosumers, maximizing renewable energy use. Modeling results indicate that this coordinated energy sharing between a pair of prosumers can improve their overall renewable energy penetration. For one specific choice of prosumers (mixed residential-commercial) penetration is shown to increase from 71% to 84%.

TI Blockchain based permission delegation and access control in Internet of
   Things (BACI)
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Access control with permission delegation mechanism allows fine granular access to secure resources. In the literature, existing architectures for permission delegation and access control are either event-based or query-based. These previous works assume a single trusted delegation service, which however is likely biased or fails to service. Also, they fail to allow users to verify delegation service operations, as such cannot be directly applied to IoT (Internet of Things) due to low power, low-bandwidth, ad-hoc and decentralized nature. This paper proposes a novel decentralized architecture for permission delegation and access control for IoT application, with demands on event and query base permission delegation. We further apply Blockchain (BC) technology to make delegation services secure, trusted, verifiable and decentralized. We investigate our proposed approach in Simple PROMELA INterpreter (SPIN) model checker using PROMELA (Process Meta Language). The "Platform Verification", "Delegation", "Mutual Exclusion" properties written in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) are also verified against the PROMELA model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI International policy coordination for blockchain supply chains
SO ASIA & THE PACIFIC POLICY STUDIES
AB From the adoption of the shipping container to coordinated trade liberalization, reductions in trade costs have propelled modern globalization. In this paper, we analyse the application of blockchain to reduce the trade costs of producing and coordinating trusted information along supply chains. Consumers, producers, and governments increasingly demand information about the quality, characteristics, and provenance of traded goods. Partially due to the risks of error and fraud, this information is costly to produce and to maintain between dispersed parties. Recent efforts have sought to overcome these costs-such as paperless trade agendas-through the application of new technologies. Our focus is on how blockchain technology can form a new decentralized economic infrastructure for supply chains by governing decentralized dynamic ledgers of information about goods as they move. We outline the potential economic consequences of blockchain supply chains before examining policy. Effective adoption faces a range of policy challenges including regulatory recognition and interoperability across jurisdictions. We propose a high-level policy forum in the Asia-Pacific region to coordinate issues such as open standards and regulatory compatibility.

TI Digital currency forecasting with chaotic meta-heuristic bio-inspired
   signal processing techniques
SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
AB The price forecasting of the digital currencies in the financial market is of great importance, especially after the recent global economic crises. Due to the nonlinear dynamics, which is including inherent fractality and chaoticity of the digital currencies, it is understood from the research conducted by many researchers that a single model is not sufficient in forecasting the digital currencies with very high accuracy. Since the single models used in the forecasting of digital currencies have weaknesses as well as their own strengths, they might not grant the best forecasting achievement in all situations for all the time. A new hybrid-forecasting framework has been proposed in digital currency time-series to minimize this negative situation and increase forecasting achievement. In this study, a novel hybrid forecasting model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and empirical wavelet transform (EWT) decomposition along with cuckoo search (CS) algorithm is developed for digital currency time series. The model is obtained by combining the LSTM neural network and EWT decomposition technique, and optimizing the intrinsic mode function (IMF) estimated outputs with CS. The price of the four most traded digital currencies such as BTC, XRP, DASH and LTC, is estimated by the proposed model and the performance of the model has been tested. The experimental results show that the hybrid model proposed for digital currency forecasting can capture nonlinear properties of digital currency time series. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI TCNS: Node Selection With Privacy Protection in Crowdsensing Based on
   Twice Consensuses of Blockchain
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT
AB With the rapid growth of smart terminals in recent years, crowdsensing which utilizes the human intelligence to solve complicated problems have gained considerable interest and exploit. The majority of the existing crowdsensing systems rely on a trusted third-party platform to complete sensing tasks and collect large-scale data. However, the platform cannot completely ensure trust in the real world. The issues of security and privacy caused by the center platform should not be ignored. In this paper, we propose a decentralized privacy-preserving model based on twice verifications and consensuses of blockchain (TCNS). In the prototype of TCNS, an anonymity strategy which can be verified based on the elliptic curve algorithm is proposed to protect the user identity privacy. Then, we propose a twice consensus mechanism, which ensures that the data can be traced and avoids data from being impersonated, tampered with, and denied. Moreover, we propose a user attribute protection scheme based on the lightweight homomorphic encryption algorithm. Finally, considering various influencing factors comprehensively, TCNS uses fuzzy theories to select the candidate mobile nodes. Further, we implement the prototype with real-world datasets, the experimental analysis of privacy protection and safety shows that TCNS can effectively prevent association analysis attacks and background knowledge attacks. More gratifying, the time overhead for generating a new block is acceptable.

TI Transparency in food supply chains: A review of enabling technology
   solutions
SO TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Modern food supply chains are complex and contain numerous stakeholders, with each performing specific roles pertaining to food production. As food supply chains become more complex, the importance of food production transparency increases. Several factors contribute to the need for transparency such as an increase in the global population, detection of foodborne illness outbreaks, efficient management of risks and recalls, and satisfying consumer demand. A case in point is the necessity that food production systems become more sustainable through improvements in production efficiency and reducing the wasting of resources and food. Other examples include the need for timely identification of the source of food production, in addition to requiring a more rapid knowledge of the cause of contamination during outbreaks of foodborne illness.
   Scope and approach: This review sets out to describe enabling technologies, provided by the Internet of Things (IoT), which have the potential to increase food production transparency. In addition, other technologies important for managing and using food supply chain data, such as blockchain and Big Data analytics, are reviewed. The IoT is the overarching technology which allows for data collection from multiple phases within supply chains leading to data driven transparent systems of food production.
   Key findings and conclusions: Enabling transparency in food supply chains via implementation of technologies will require considerable effort from all stakeholders involved, resulting in many new challenges and requirements that must be addressed. These challenges and requirements range from technical issues, such as Internet connection, storage requirements, device security, and government requirements and regulations, to those concerning consumer acceptance.

TI The power of a blockchain-based supply chain
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. It is designed to maintain the quality of sensitive goods during the whole shipment. Centralized supply chain management systems expose the supply chain to corruption, fraud, and tampering. Blockchain has emerged as a new distributed information technology; it represents a new approach in supply chain area, where visibility and transparency of product flows are the principal challenges. This paper describes how the blockchain can be integrated into the supply chain architecture to create a reliable, transparent, authentic and secure system. To reach this goal, we studied the benefits of introducing the blockchain to the supply chain and the challenges encountered in a blockchain-based supply chain management ecosystem. We combined theoretical and real-world application studies to build our theory about the requirements for an efficient blockchain-based supply chain.

TI Smart Contracts for Spectrum Sensing as a Service
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Mobile network operators (MNO) can opportunistically use the licensed bands of the primary users (PU) provided that they monitor the spectrum and stop their transmission upon detection of the PU. As deploying spectrum sensors may be prohibitively expensive, the MNO can buy spectrum sensing service from sensing helpers in its proximity. However, such a trade requires a framework with three key functions: helper selection, faulty or malicious helper identification, and payment to honest helpers. Here, we introduce Spass which provides these functions and facilitates a fair exchange between the entities without a trusted third party via smart contracts (SC) running on a blockchain network. While payments via SCs seem conceptually simple, realizing it is difficult due to the cost of using SC functions which might be prohibitive as write/computation operations on the SCs might have a cost, e.g., in Ethereum. Considering our design goals and SC-related overhead, we derive the optimal Spass parameters maximizing the MNO's profit. Moreover, we propose a K-means clustering approach to identify independent malicious helpers, and using both lossless and lossy compression on the helpers' sensing report to decrease the cost of write operations. Via simulations, we show under which conditions Spass-powered service leads to a profitable business for an MNO.

TI Data Transparency with Blockchain and AI Ethics
SO ACM JOURNAL OF DATA AND INFORMATION QUALITY
AB Providing a 360 degrees view of a given data item especially for sensitive data is essential toward not only protecting the data and associated privacy but also assuring trust, compliance, and ethics of the systems that use or manage such data. With the advent of General Data Protection Regulation, California Data Privacy Law, and other such regulatory requirements, it is essential to support data transparency in all such dimensions. Moreover, data transparency should not violate privacy and security requirements. In this article, we put forward a vision for how data transparency would be achieved in a de-centralized fashion using blockchain technology.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper studies the forecasting ability of cryptocurrency time series. This study is about the four most capitalised cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Different Bayesian models are compared, including models with constant and time-varying volatility, such as stochastic volatility and GARCH. Moreover, some cryptopredictors are included in the analysis, such as S&P 500 and Nikkei 225. In this paper, the results show that stochastic volatility is significantly outperforming the benchmark of VAR in both point and density forecasting. Using a different type of distribution, for the errors of the stochastic volatility, the student-t distribution is shown to outperform the standard normal approach.

TI A Secure and Efficient Blockchain-Based Data Trading Approach for

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient blockchain-based data trading approach for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). First, we apply consortium blockchain technologies to ensure secure and truthful data trading, and propose a general blockchain-based data trading framework for IoV. Second, to improve the efficiency of data trading and encourage more participants to trade data, we propose an iterative double auction mechanism with the purpose of achieving social welfare maximization, in which pricing rules of buyers and sellers are designed to induce participants to submit bids and to decide the amount of traded data and its price among buyers and sellers. In particular, in our algorithm, the hidden information of individuals can be extracted gradually so that the privacy of participants in data trading can be protected well. Finally, the experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm. Moreover, the correctness of social welfare maximization, incentive compatibility, individually rationality, and weakly budget balance of our auction mechanism are verified in the experiments.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB In recent years, increasing attention has been devoted to cryptocurrencies, owing to their great development and valorization. In this study, we propose to analyse four of the major cryptocurrencies, based on their market capitalization and data availability: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. We apply detrended fluctuation analysis (the regular one and with a sliding windows approach) and detrended cross-correlation analysis and the respective correlation coefficient. We find that Bitcoin and Ripple seem to behave as efficient financial assets, while Ethereum and Litecoin present some evidence of persistence. When correlating Bitcoin with the other cryptocurrencies under analysis, we find that for short time scales, all the cryptocurrencies have statistically significant correlations with Bitcoin, although Ripple has the highest correlations. For higher time scales, Ripple is the only cryptocurrency with significant correlation.

SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Distributed ledger technology, also known as the blockchain, is gaining traction globally. Blockchain offers a secure validation mechanism and decentralized mass collaboration. Cryptocurrencies make use of this technology as a new asset class for investors worldwide. Cryptocurrencies are being used by companies to raise capital via initial coin offerings (ICOs). The substantial inflow of unregulated capital into a transactional and transnational industry has aroused interest from not just investors, but also national securities and monetary regulatory agencies. In this paper, we review the Security and Exchange Commission's initial statements and subsequent pronouncements on ICO's to illustrate the potential problems with applying an older legal framework to an ever-evolving ecosystem. Recognizing the inability of enforcement within existing regulatory frameworks, we discuss the importance of regulation of the crypto asset class and internal collaboration between government agencies and developers in the establishment of an ecosystem that integrates investor protection and investments.

TI Influence maximization in online social network using different
   centrality measures as seed node of information propagation
SO SADHANA-ACADEMY PROCEEDINGS IN ENGINEERING SCIENCES
AB Information propagation in the network is probabilistic in nature; simultaneously, it depends on the connecting paths of the propagation. Selection of seed nodes plays an important role in determining the levels and depth of the contagion in the network. This paper presents a comparative study when seed nodes for information propagation are selected through the properties of different centrality measures in the social network. This study captures the interaction measures of nodes in the social network, selects seed nodes based on five centrality measures, i.e. degree distribution, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, Eigenvector and PageRank, and compares the affected nodes and levels of propagation within the network. We demonstrate the performance of the different centrality measures by processing three datasets of social network: Twitter network, Bitcoin network and author collaborative network. For the propagation of the information, we use breadth-first search (BFS) and susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model and a detailed comparative study is also presented for each of the seed nodes selected using aforementioned network properties. Results show that the Eigenvector centrality and PageRank centrality measures outperform other centrality measures in all test cases in terms of propagation level and affected nodes during information propagation. Both Eigenvector and PageRank network data processing required a high computational overhead. For this reason we propose a hybrid model where using k-core the network is degenerated into a smaller network and centrality nodes are extracted from the smaller network. These centrality nodes, as compared to original centrality nodes, perform almost in the same manner in terms of influence maximization when k is chosen in a rational way.

TI DeliveryCoin: An IDS and Blockchain-Based Delivery Framework for

SO COMPUTERS
AB In this paper, we propose an intrusion detection system (IDS) and Blockchain-based delivery framework, called DeliveryCoin, for drone-delivered services. The DeliveryCoin framework consists of four phases, including system initialization phase, creating the block, updating the blockchain, and intrusion detection phase. To achieve privacy-preservation, the DeliveryCoin framework employs hash functions and short signatures without random oracles and the Strong Diffie-Hellman (SDH) assumption in bilinear groups. To achieve consensus inside the blockchain-based delivery platform, we introduce a UAV-aided forwarding mechanism, named pBFTF. We also propose an IDS system in each macro eNB (5G) for detecting self-driving network attacks as well as false transactions between self-driving nodes. Furthermore, extensive simulations are conducted, and results confirm the efficiency of our proposed DeliveryCoin framework in terms of latency of blockchain consensus and accuracy.

AB Advances in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, offer unprecedented opportunities to boost a wide array of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Nevertheless, UAV platforms still face important limitations mainly related to autonomy and weight that impact their remote sensing capabilities when capturing and processing the data required for developing autonomous and robust real-time obstacle detection and avoidance systems. In this regard, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have arisen as a promising alternative for improving real-time obstacle detection and collision avoidance for highly autonomous UAVs. This article reviews the most recent developments on DL Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) and provides a detailed explanation on the main DL techniques. Moreover, the latest DL-UAV communication architectures are studied and their most common hardware is analyzed. Furthermore, this article enumerates the most relevant open challenges for current DL-UAV solutions, thus allowing future researchers to define a roadmap for devising the new generation affordable autonomous DL-UAV IoT solutions.

TI Scalable Blockchain Protocol Based on Proof of Stake and Sharding
SO JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND INTELLIGENT
   INFORMATICS
AB Blockchain - a distributed and public database of transactions - has become a platform for decentralized applications. Despite its increasing popularity, blockchain technology faces a scalability problem: the throughput does not scale with the increasing network size. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable blockchain protocol to solve the scalability problem. The proposed method was designed based on a proof of stake (PoS) consensus protocol and a sharding protocol. Instead of transactions being processed by the whole network, the sharding protocol is employed to divide unconfirmed transactions into transaction shards and to divide the network into network shards. The network shards process the transaction shards in parallel to produce middle blocks. Middle blocks are then combined into a final BLOCK in a timestamp recorded on the blockchain. Experiments were performed in a simulation network consisting of 100 Amazon EC2 instances. The latency of the proposed method was approximately 27 s and the maximum throughput achieved was 36 transactions per second for a network containing 100 nodes. The results of the experiments indicate that the throughput of the proposed protocol increases with the network size. This confirms the scalability of the proposed protocol.

TI Curating on the Web: The Evolution of Platforms as Spaces for Producing
   and Disseminating Web-Based Art
SO ARTS
AB By analysing a series of exhibition projects responding to central changes in web technology since its public unveiling (1991), this study identifies a historical trajectory for discussing the evolution of curating on the web. Such evolution highlights how curators have devised exhibition models that operate as platforms for not only displaying art specific to the web, but also for producing and disseminating it in a way that responds to the developments of web technology-and its socio-cultural and economic impact. With the massification of web tools, in fact, these platforms have generated distributed systems of artistic production free from the physical and conceptual limitations of the gallery and museum space. They have not only become spaces for displaying art, but also platforms that nurture its production, different modes of audience engagement and critique the canons of the institutionalised art world. Originating from the desire to reduce the historical fragmentation of this field of work and its partial mapping, this study follows a periodisation that starts from the early internet, with its BBS-enabled platforms such as ARTEX (1980), to introduce the 1990s experimentations with the web browser and the developments of projects like ada'web (1995). It then dives into the Web 2.0 when, with the platformisation of the technology, curators developed an array of approaches for adopting existing web services, as in the instances of CuratingYouTube (2007-present) and #exstrange (2017). Lastly, it outlines the trends of today's web, which saw the birth of projects like the blockchain-enabled cointemporary (2014), to then draw conclusions about the relevance of this historical trajectory in the field of curatorial studies and the production of web-based and digital art.

TI Determining the provenance and authenticity of seafood: A review of
   current methodologies
SO TRENDS IN FOOD SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB Background: Globally, food provenance has become a concern for government authorities, the seafood industry and consumers due to increasing food safety and authenticity requirements. Wild-catch fisheries and aquaculture are both important industries; aquaculture is seen as an opportunity to strengthen food security for the growing global population. However, unregulated aquaculture can expose consumers to health risks from pathogens, antibiotics and banned chemicals. Consumers and retailers, and the reputation of the global seafood industry, is affected by food fraud through species substitution and the exchange of aquaculture produce with wild-caught product and vice versa. To ensure consumer confidence and to allow authorities to effectively enforce reguladons and contain risks, methods to determine the species, production methods and geographic origin of seafood need to be readily available.
   Scope and approach: This review summarises the currently available and emerging methodologies to determine the provenance and authenticity of seafood. The main focus of this review is to give an overview of the methods that could potentially be used by authorities to enforce regulations and to contain risks, and for the seafood industry to self-regulate and protect itself from food fraud.
   Key findings and conclusions: The most common methods used are DNA profiling, fatty acid profiling, different methods of inductively coupled plasma spectrometry and stable isotope analysis. Additionally, methods such as blockchain, radio frequency identification and x-ray fluorescence through Itrax are currently being tested for their effectiveness in determining seafood provenance. However, these methods have drawbacks and it is likely that a combination of methods would be best suited to determine the provenance of seafood considering its complex supply chain.

AB The primary purpose of this research is to present the evolution and current state of knowledge regarding the dematerialization of banking products and services in the digital age. The paper discusses the central issues regarding the dematerialization of money, the dematerialization of securities and the dematerialization of the contract, trends with direct impact on the possibility of dematerializing the products and services offered by banking institutions, by means of an investigative discourse and viewpoint into and over the shift from tangible to intangible monetary assets. It mainly explores the impact of dematerialization on certain processes performed by banks (customer enrollment and management) and on certain products and services offered by banks (payment services, lending services, etc.) from the perspective of the latest technological innovations and the influence exerted by fintech companies. The chapter clearly establishes the synergy link between environmental factors (increased competition, technological advance, legislative changes) and the ability of banking institutions to adapt to new conditions by changing the business model. The research ends with a series of conclusions regarding the way in which the tendencies towards dematerialization affect the activity and the business model adopted by the banking institutions. The content of the research report is useful both to the managers in the financial field and to the authorities that legislate this field, especially to those in Romania, who can use the conclusions of the report to elaborate policies in order to advance the degree of digitization of the Romanian banking system.

TI SLA-Based Sharing Economy Service with Smart Contract for Resource
   Integrity in the Internet of Things
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Recently, technology startups have leveraged the potential of blockchain-based technologies to govern institutions or interpersonal trust by enforcing signed treaties among different individuals in a decentralized environment. However, it is going to be hard enough convincing that the blockchain technology could completely replace the trust among trading partners in the sharing economy as sharing services always operate in a highly dynamic environment. With the rapid expanding of the rental market, the sharing economy faces more and more severe challenges in the form of regulatory uncertainty and concerns about abuses. This paper proposes an enhanced decentralized sharing economy service using the service level agreement (SLA), which documents the services the provider will furnish and defines the service standards the provider is obligated to meet. The SLA specifications are defined as the smart contract, which facilitates multi-user collaboration and automates the process with no involvement of the third party. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed solution in the sharing economy, a notebook sharing case study is implemented using the Hyperledger Fabric. The functionalities of the smart contract are tested using the Hyperledger Composer. Moreover, the efficiency of the designed approach is demonstrated through a series of experimental tests using different performance metrics.

The ability for Paramedics to access a patient's complete picture of emergency-relevant medical data is critical and can significantly reduce the annual mortality rate. Today, the problem exists with a continuous recording system of the patient data between healthcare providers. In this paper, we have introduced a blockchain-based solution to record patient emergency relevant medical data as patient walks through from one medical facility to another, creating a continuous footprint of patient as a secure and scalable data source. Therefore, ambulance crews can access and use it to provide high quality pre-hospital care. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

TI Autonomous and malware-proof blockchain-based firmware update platform
   with efficient batch verification for Internet of Things devices
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices are expected to penetrate users' lives everywhere. However, the occurrence of several massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks in infected IoT devices has brought increased attention to the importance of IoT security. Since IoT devices are equipped only with lightweight operation systems, the installation of antivirus software cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, a method through which the firmware of IoT devices can be securely and autonomously updated must be developed. This paper proposes a blockchain-based firmware updating platform to enhance the process of updating firmware. A smart contract is used to ensure integrity and enforce the scanning of malicious code. With a peer-to-peer file sharing system, our platform enjoys high availability without the single failure point problem, mitigating the possibility of DDoS attacks. We use batch verification in case of multiple updating requests for better scalability. Through function comparisons and performance simulation, our scheme is shown to be effective in strengthening IoT security. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A blockchain-based smart contract trading mechanism for energy power
   supply and demand network
SO ADVANCES IN PRODUCTION ENGINEERING & MANAGEMENT
AB To overcome the high cost, high risk and poor efficiency of traditional centralized electric energy trading method, this paper proposes an efficient trading mechanism for energy power supply and demand network (EPSDN) based on blockchain smart contract, considering the opening of the sales side market in China. Specifically, the encourage-real-quotation (ERQ) rule was adopted to determine the clearing queue and price, thus smoothing the supply and demand interaction between the EPSDN node. Meanwhile, the blockchain smart contract was introduced into the transaction to form a sealed quotation function, which eliminates the centralization and high cost and solves the poor transparency and trust in traditional transaction. In addition, the transaction efficiency was improved through the construction of an efficient power trading system and a secure trading environment. A case study is given in the end of the paper. Case study shows that the blockchain-based smart contract trading system for the EPSDN can achieve desirable security and effectiveness, and effectively solve the problems of the traditional centralized trading method. The research findings lay solid theoretical and decision-making bases for small-scale transactions in the electric energy market. (C) 2019 CPE, University of Maribor. All rights reserved.

TI Research on Smart Contract Optimization Method on Blockchain
SO IT PROFESSIONAL
AB The smart contract on the blockchain allows credible transactions without a third party. These transactions are traceable and irreversible. The deployment and implementation of smart contracts in Ethernet will consume some gas, which will directly affect the cost of smart contracts. In order to reduce the consumption of gas during the execution of smart contracts, this article proposes an optimization algorithm for generating business process smart contracts. First, business process modeling notation (BPMN) models are extended to Petri nets. Second, Petri nets are simplified to find nodes in BPMN models that can be considered fusion tasks. Using new mapping rules from the BPMN model to solidity language, BPMN model is generated into Ethereum Smart contract model. In the BPMN models with multilayer fusion task, experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can save 15% gas on average for business processes with multiple fusion tasks.

TI Efficient and secure attribute-based heterogeneous online/offline
   signcryption for body sensor networks based on blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB In body sensor networks, both wearable and implantable biosensors are deployed in a patient body to monitor and collect patient health record information. The health record information is then transmitted toward the medical server via a base station for analysis, diagnosis, and treatment by medical experts. Advancement in wireless technology although improves the patient health-monitoring mechanism, but still there are some limitations regarding security, privacy, and efficiency due to open wireless channel and limited resources of body sensor networks. To overcome these limitations, we have proposed an efficient and secure heterogeneous scheme for body sensor networks, in which biosensor nodes use a certificate-less cryptography environment to resolve the key escrow and certificate-management problems, while MS uses a public key infrastructure environment to enhance the scalability of the networks. Furthermore, we design an online/offline signcryption method to overcome the burden on biosensor nodes. We split the signcryption process into two phases: offline phase and online phase. In the offline phase, the major operations are computed without prior knowledge of patient data. While in online phase, the minor operations are computed when patient data are known. Besides, we have used a new hybrid blockchain technology approach for the secure transmission of patient information along with attributes stored in the medical server toward the cloud that provides ease of patient data access remotely from anywhere by the authorized users and data backup in case of medical server failure. Moreover, hybrid blockchain provides advantages of interoperability, transparency traceability, and universal access. The formal security analysis of the proposed scheme is proved in the standard model, and informal security assures that our scheme provides resistance against possible attacks. As compared to other existing schemes, our proposed scheme consumes fewer resources and efficient in terms of processing cost, transmission overhead, and energy consumption.

TI Digital health and nursing The future is now
SO UNFALLCHIRURG
AB The digitalization of healthcare systems is no longer a trend but a reality, which is driven by the rapid developments in the fields of medicine, information and communication technology (ICT). It revolutionizes the practice of medicine by making innovative treatment forms possible by the accelerated exchange of patient data. In this way it brings tremendous advantages to all stakeholders in healthcare delivery. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases and multimorbidity, the decreasing number of physicians, long distances and poor road infrastructure between doctors and patients create loopholes in the delivery of healthcare services, especially in rural regions, which can at least partially be filled by the use of telemedicine. The acceptance of ehealth is the most important success factor in its use for the management of patients. User-friendliness, efficiency, effectiveness, legal safety and reimbursement of telemedical services are the important conditions for this. Furthermore, training and continuing training of healthcare personnel also drive the development of telemedicine. Factors delaying the use of telemedicine are partial lack of reimbursement and lack of interoperability among different systems of medical technology. Pilot projects serve to provide evidence for the usefulness and effectiveness of telemedicine. They also help to build the structural foundation on which telemedicine can develop. Examples of such projects are emergency triage, online video consultations and digital care projects. There are many emerging trends in the field of digital health, which are developing at different paces. Examples of such trends are artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain and augmented reality.

CY SEP 16-20, 2019
CL Wurzburg, GERMANY
AB Given a multigraph stream (e.g., Facebook messages or network traffic) where duplicate edges arrive continuously, how can we accurately and memory-efficiently estimate local triangles for all nodes? Local triangle counting in a graph stream is one of the fundamental tasks in graph mining with important applications including anomaly detection, social role identification, community detection, etc. Many recent graph streams include duplicate edges, hence form multigraph streams: e.g., many network packets might have a same (source, destination) pair. Although there have been several local triangle counting methods for multigraph streams, they have problems in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency; furthermore, most methods support either binary or weighted counting, and thus cannot find anomalies whose detection requires both types of counting. In this paper, we propose FURL, a memory-efficient and accurate local triangle counting method for multigraph streams. FURL has two main advantages. First, FURL improves accuracy by (1) reducing the variance of its estimation via a regularization strategy, and (2) sampling more triangles than the state-of-the-art methods do, by using its memory space efficiently. Second, FURL finds anomalies which state-of-the-art methods cannot discover. Experimental results show that FURL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency. Thanks to FURL, we discover interesting anomalies from a Bitcoin network.

AB Information support for organization and management of functional areas in a territory has been considered from the standpoint of innovation. Adequacy and proximity of territorial life activity perspectives based on interaction of its functional areas to the perspectives and concepts of spatial economics has been shown. Based on the requirements of a system approach, a set of structures that determine the operation of social and business areas in a territory has been considered; management of a social and business area in a territory is presented as an act of impact on facilities in the functional areas of a territory for the purpose of changing their operational format and can thereby selectively affect each of six parameters and current characteristics of a model reflecting the state of functional areas in a territory that are listed in the paper below. The work also justifies an approach to implementing a distributed information system to support processes through the case study of a control area, a functional agricultural area in a territory, which uses Blockchain technology for gathering, processing, storage, organization and management of key data about each product through the example of products in the functional agricultural area of the territory during their life cycles.

TI High frequency volatility co-movements in cryptocurrency markets
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS & MONEY
AB Through the application of Diagonal BEKK and Asymmetric Diagonal BEKK methodologies to intra-day data for eight cryptocurrencies, this paper investigates not only conditional volatility dynamics of major cryptocurrencies, but also their volatility co-movements. We first provide evidence that all conditional variances are significantly affected by both previous squared errors and past conditional volatility. It is also shown that both methodologies indicate that cryptocurrency investors pay the most attention to news relating to Neo and the least attention to news relating to Dash, while shocks in OmiseGo persist the least and shocks in Bitcoin persist the most, although all of the considered cryptocurrencies possess high levels of persistence of volatility over time. We also demonstrate that the conditional covariances are significantly affected by both cross-products of past error terms and past conditional covariances, suggesting strong interdependencies between cryptocurrencies. It is also demonstrated that the Asymmetric Diagonal BEKK model is a superior choice of methodology, with our results suggesting significant asymmetric effects of positive and negative shocks in the conditional volatility of the price returns of all of our investigated cryptocurrencies, while the conditional covariances capture asymmetric effects of good and bad news accordingly. Finally, it is shown that time-varying conditional correlations exist, with our selected cryptocurrencies being strongly positively correlated, further highlighting interdependencies within cryptocurrency markets.

AB WHEN SHAUL KFIR cofounded Digital Asset in 2014, he was out to prove something to the financial services industry. He saw it as being not only hamstrung by an inefficient system for transaction reconciliation, but also in danger of missing out on what blockchain technology could do to address its shortcomings.
   Since then, Digital Asset has gone to market with its own distributed-ledger technology, DAML (Digital Asset Modeling Language). And that does indeed take advantage of blockchain-only not in quite the way Kfir had initially intended. He and Digital Asset ended up taking an engineering "journey" to get to where they are today.
   Kfir readily admits his own background in cryptography and cryptocurrency-both as a researcher (at Technion and MIT) and as a cryptocurrency entrepreneur in Israel-had more than just a little to do with the course that was originally charted. As for lessons learned along the way, Camille Fournier, the head of platform development for a leading New York City hedge fund, helps to elicit those here. She brings to the exercise her own background in distributed-systems consensus (as one of the original committers to the Apache Zookeeper Project) and financial services (as a former VP of technology at Goldman Sachs).

TI Blockchain in Energy Efficiency: Potential Applications and Benefits
SO ENERGIES
AB Blockchain technology is ready to disrupt nearly every industry and business model, and the energy sector is no exception. Energy businesses across the world have already started exploring the use of blockchain technology in large-scale energy trading systems, peer-to-peer energy trading, project financing, supply chain tracking, and asset management among other applications. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) recently started revolutionizing the energy landscape, and now blockchain technology is providing an additional opportunity to make the energy system more intelligent, efficient, transparent, and secure in the longer term. The idea of this paper is to examine more closely the use of blockchain technology for its possible application in the energy efficiency industry and to determine how it could make energy efficiency markets more secure and transparent in the longer term. This paper examines in detail the key benefits and implications of using blockchain in the energy efficiency sector through the presentation and discussion of two case studies as possible blockchain applications-(i) the UK Energy Company Obligation scheme and (ii) the Italian White Certificate Scheme. We have presented how the key issues around trading energy efficiency savings-correctly estimating the savings, data transparency among stakeholders, and inefficient administrative processes-can be solved through the application of a blockchain-based smart contract system. Finally, this paper presents an implementation of a smart contract for trading of energy-saving certificates achieved via execution of smart contract transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

TI Interference of billing and scheduling strategies for energy and cost
   savings in modern data centers
SO SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS & SYSTEMS
AB The high energy consumption of HPC systems is an obstacle for ever-growing systems. Unfortunately, energy consumption does not decrease linearly with reduced workload; therefore, energy conservation techniques have been deployed on various levels which steer the overall system. While the overall saving of energy is useful, the price of energy is not necessarily proportional to the consumption. Particularly with renewable energies, there are occasions in which the price is significantly lower. The potential of saving energy costs when using smart contracts with energy providers is lacking research. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the potential savings when applying cost-aware schedulers to data center workloads while considering power contracts that allow for dynamic (hourly) pricing.
   The contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) the theoretic assessment of cost savings; (2) the development of a simulator to replay batch scheduler traces which supports flexible energy cost models and various cost-aware scheduling algorithms. This allows to approximate the energy costs savings of data centers for various scenarios including off-peak and hourly budgeted energy prices as provided by the energy spot market. An evaluation is conducted with four annual job traces from the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ).
   The theoretic analysis indicates a cost savings for 4-8% when shutting down unused client nodes, and 6-20% with hourly cost models and optimal scheduling. The experimental validation of a practicable scheduler increases the accuracy against the theoretical best case analysis. As expected, a cost-efficient scheduling algorithm that is fed with the information about future energy costs shifts the jobs to the timeslots where the job execution is cheaper and reduces the energy expenditure, yet increases the waiting times of pending jobs. However, the expected savings for this effort are not justifiable compared to the simple strategy of turning off the unused nodes. Additionally, we compare the cost savings to the total costs of ownership showing that smaller systems with on-demand provisioning yield better cost efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI Which Cryptocurrencies Are Mostly Traded in Distressed Times?
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB This paper investigates the level of liquidity of digital currencies during the very intense bearish phase in their markets. The data employed span the period from April 2018 until January 2019, which is the second phase of bearish times with almost constant decreases. The Amihud's illiquidity ratio is employed in order to measure the liquidity of these digital assets. Findings indicate that the most popular cryptocurrencies exhibit higher levels of liquidity during stressed periods. Thereby, it is revealed that investors' preferences for trading during highly risky times are favorable for well-known virtual currencies in the detriment of less-known ones. This enhances findings of relevant literature about strong and persistent positive or negative herding behavior of investors based on Bitcoin, Ethereum and highly-capitalized cryptocurrencies in general. Notably though, a tendency towards investing in the TrueUSD stablecoin has also emerged.

TI Blockchain Meets VANET: An Architecture for Identity and Location
   Privacy Protection in VANET
SO PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS
AB With the breakthroughs in sensor technology and internet of things, Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is developing into a new generation. The technical challenges of current VANET are decentralized architecture deployment and privacy protection. Since the blockchain owns the characteristics of being decentralized, distributed, collective maintenance and non-tampering, this paper designs a novel decentralized architecture using blockchain technology, which is called blockchain-based VANET. The blockchain-based VANET involves four major stages: blockchain set-up, registration of vehicles, SBMs upload, and blockchain record. It can effectively address the problems of centralization and mutual distrust between entities in current VANET. For protecting identity and location privacy, we propose UGG, IPP and LPP algorithms with the way of dynamic threshold encryption and k-anonymity unity in the stage of SBMs upload of blockchain-based VANET. To quantify the availability of k-anonymity unity, we propose two indicators: connectivity and average distance. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of blockchain-based VANET. We analyze the simulation results from four aspects: system time, average distance, connectivity, and privacy leakage. The simulation results show that our proposed architecture performs better in terms of processing time than current architectures. Furthermore, our proposed architecture shows its superior in the aspect of protecting identity and location privacy.

TI Trust-Enhanced Content Delivery in Blockchain-Based Information-Centric
   Networking
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB With the fast-growing demands for efficient and scalable content distribution, information-centric networking (ICN) can be a promising candidate for future networks. ICN promises direct retrieval of the content using its unique, persistent, and location-independent name. In ICN, all nodes work together to scale up content delivery, but security issues caused by malicious behaviors of ICN nodes cannot be avoided. To this end, in this article we develop a trust-enhanced blockchain based ICN (BICN) architecture for content delivery. In our proposed architecture, the whole process of content delivery is first traced in an implicitly trusted way by exploiting the excellent properties of the blockchain, so that the malicious ICN nodes can be located. Second, we leverage transactions to record the mapping between human-readable name and self-certifying name in BICN, which supports convenient and trusted alteration for users' requirements. Moreover, we present a case study in BICN based smart grid for energy data delivery, where we perform security analysis and conduct experiments. Numerical results show the superior performance of our proposal. Finally, we present open issues for future work.

TI A novel GSP auction mechanism for ranking Bitcoin transactions in
   blockchain mining
SO DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS
AB Bitcoin is gaining ground in recent years. In the Bitcoin system, miners provide computing power to confirm transactions and mine blocks in pursuit of transaction fees, while users compete by bidding transaction fees for faster confirmation. This process is in essence analogous to online ad auctions, where advertisers bid for more prominent ad slots. Therefore, inspired by the Generalized Second Price (GSP) mechanism dominantly used in online ad auctions, we propose to adopt the GSP auction model in the Bitcoin transaction confirmation game. Also, we use weighted fees as the new ranking basis, which can be calculated by user-submitted fees, transaction size, quality scores and virtual fees accumulated from the waiting time. We show that the formulated static GSP transaction fee auction with complete information has a unique Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Then, we discuss the impacts of quality scores and virtual fees on users' equilibrium fee decisions and payoffs. Finally, computational experiments are designed to validate our theoretical models and analysis. Our research findings indicate that this novel GSP mechanism is superior to the currently adopted GFP mechanism, and can help users save fees. Besides, quality scores and virtual fees are also proven to be effective on reducing users' paid fees. Moreover, the design of virtual fees allows all transactions to be processed more efficiently in a uniform pipeline, and the interests of transactions with and without associated fees are taken into consideration.

TI Blockchain-enabled workflow operating system for logistics resources
   sharing in E-commerce logistics real estate service
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB E-commerce logistics real estate (EcLRE) is on the rise with the rapid development of logistics industry and continuous prosperity of real estate. The profit model for EcLRE is moving towards offering professional logistics services instead of simple real estate leasing. As the attributes for real estate are definite and difficult to change, the improvement of logistics service becomes necessity for EcLRE service providers to gain competitiveness in the market. However, the heterogeneous requirements from different service demanders place great challenges for the EcLRE service providers. The most puzzled one is to prevent fragmentation of logistics resources to serve different demanders (customers). This phenomenon of resource fragmentation is aggravated by the implementation of demanders' (customers') own information technologies or management requirements. To achieve the central management of logistics resources to serve heterogeneous demanders becomes an imperative requirement for EcLRE service provider. Therefore, this paper proposed a blockchain-enabled workflow operating system (Bc-WfOS) to centrally share heterogeneous logistics resources with different customers. Three key innovative technologies are involved to empower Bc-WfOS. The first one is gateway technology introduced to realize the UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) management of heterogeneous logistics resources. Secondly, to effectively and efficiently coordinate logistics resources, a multi-dimensional workflow model is proposed with corresponding workflow operation mechanism to suit different business logic. Additionally, a resource blockchain is designed with the integration of blockchain technology with agent technology to guarantee the data reliability to provide accurate front-line resource execution data for different customers to conduct higher decision-makings. Aiming at verifying the proposed Bc-WfOS, a prototype system is also developed and implemented in laboratory environment for conducting experimental case studies based on a real-life case.

TI Ultra-low-power sub-photon-voltage high-efficiency light-emitting diodes
SO NATURE PHOTONICS
AB Conventional light-emitting diodes (LEDs) face an efficiency droop at low current due to non-radiative recombination overtaking radiative recombination at low carrier density. To overcome this universal problem, we develop LEDs with high efficiency at ultralow current and voltage, using a novel quantum well design and high-quality interfaces to suppress non-radiative recombination and enhance radiative recombination. The device exhibits close to unity internal quantum efficiency at a low current density of <1 x 10(-4) A cm(-2) , more than three orders of magnitude lower than conventional LEDs. The LED bias voltage is reduced to -30% below the photon voltage (h nu / q). Wireless communication is demonstrated at these low-power conditions, which enables new applications in smart dust and sensor networks(1-6), low-cost block chain and authentication(7-9), medical applications(10,)(11) and wherever high efficiency at low power is needed. New phenomena such as high-efficiency electroluminescent cooling becomes possible as the LED unity internal quantum efficiency extends to smaller voltage and current.

TI Do Higher Asymmetry Threshold Effects Exist on the Gold Return
   Volatility during Highly Fluctuating Periods?
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The GJR-GARCH model is frequently used by researchers and academic institutions. However, the model conveys limited information, using zero as a threshold without considering other possible thresholds. This study shows that a favorable econometric model could be formed by constructing a hybrid momentum HMTAR-GARCH model. Our findings indicate that higher asymmetry momentum threshold effects exist on the gold return volatility during highly fluctuating periods. Sustainable Enterprise Resource Planning (S-ERP) systems could help in the formation of a good risk management strategy by using the HMTAR-GARCH model. Perhaps gold is more sustainable than many other financial assets in the creation of an investment portfolio.

TI Volatility in the Cryptocurrency Market
SO OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW
AB How do cryptocurrency prices evolve? Is there any interdependence among cryptocurrency returns and/or volatilities? Are there any return spillovers and volatility spillovers between the cryptocurrency market and other financial markets? To answer these questions, we use GARCH-in-mean models to examine the relationship between volatility and returns of leading cryptocurrencies, to investigate spillovers within the cryptocurrency market, and also from the cryptocurrency market to other financial markets. Overall, we find statistically significant transmission of shocks and volatilities among the leading cryptocurrencies. We also find statistically significant spillover effects from the cryptocurrency market to other financial markets in the United States, as well as in other leading economies (Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan).

TI Implementing Smart Contracts in the Syndicated Loan Market: An Issue of
   Adoption
SO IT PROFESSIONAL
AB Distributed ledger technology allows for data to be recorded, shared, and synchronized across multiple distributed data stores. This brought forth the idea of using this technology to build consensus. Implementing this technology within the Syndicated Loan Market through Smart Contracts allows for reduced manual labor and back-office workloads as well as the removal of reconciliation and corporate actions. As a result, counterparty risk and settlement times will be minimized, and performance and transparency for regular reporting will increase. However, an individual's embrace of this new technology will determine its successful implementation. To address this issue, this article examines the trust model, trust in technology drivers, and the revised unified theory of acceptance and use of the technology model to construct the trust and adoption of the technology model. This article culminates in guidelines for the implementation of Smart Contracts. Avenues for future work include the investigation of a multimotive information systems acceptance model.

TI Simple Schnorr multi-signatures with applications to Bitcoin
SO DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY
AB We describe a new Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme (i.e., a protocol which allows a group of signers to produce a short, joint signature on a common message) called MuSig, provably secure under the Discrete Logarithm assumption and in the plain public-key model (meaning that signers are only required to have a public key, but do not have to prove knowledge of the private key corresponding to their public key to some certification authority or to other signers before engaging the protocol). MuSig improves over the state-of-art scheme of Bellare and Neven (ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security-CCS 2006) and its variants by Bagherzandi et al. (ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security-CCS 2008) and Ma et al. (Des Codes Cryptogr 54(2):121-133, 2010) in two respects: (i) it is simple and efficient, having the same key and signature size as standard Schnorr signatures; (ii) it allows key aggregation, which informally means that the joint signature can be verified exactly as a standard Schnorr signature with respect to a single "aggregated" public key which can be computed from the individual public keys of the signers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-signature scheme provably secure under the Discrete Logarithm assumption in the plain public-key model which allows key aggregation. As an application, we explain how our new multi-signature scheme could improve both performance and user privacy in Bitcoin.

SO CAHIERS DE DROIT
AB The purpose of this paper is to assess the ability of the smart contract to become a new vector of trust in the contractual field. We present and analyze this new phenomenon which has emerged in the wake of blockchain technology. The smart contract is a combination of two technical processes : computable contract and blockchain technology. Together, they create the possibility of tamper-resistant contracts whose performance is automatic and transparent. Being basically a computable contract, the smart contract has a limited scope so that it is not yet able to offer a definitive solution to the problem of trust. However, it is clear that by improving transparency and guaranteeing the proper performance of a contract, when technically possible, the smart contract may help re-establish a climate of trust between the parties.

TI How to regulate bitcoin? Decentralized regulation for a decentralized
   cryptocurrency
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Bitcoin is a distributed system. The dilemma it poses to the legal systems is that it is hardly possible to regulate a distributed network in a centralized fashion, as decentralized cryptocurrencies are antithetical to the existing centralized structure of monetary and financial regulation. This article proposes a more nuanced policy recommendation for regulatory intervention in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, which relies on a decentralized regulatory architecture built upon the existing regulatory infrastructure and makes use of the existing and emerging middlemen. It argues that instead of regulating the technology or the cryptocurrencies at the code or protocol layer, the regulation should target their use-cases. Such a regulatory strategy can be implemented through directing the edicts of regulation towards the middlemen and can be enforced by the existing financial market participants and traditional gatekeepers such as banks, payment service providers and exchanges, as well as large and centralized node operators and miners.

Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to introduce and conceptually ground blockchain in sport and discuss the implications and value proposition of blockchain to the sport industry. After a brief overview of blockchain and the technology stack, the mechanism is conceptually rooted in the network paradigm, a framework already known to the academic sport community. This treatment argues that the decentralized, closed, and dense mesh network produced by blockchain technology is beneficial to the sport industry. Notably, the article identifies blockchain's capacity to facilitate new sources of revenue and improve data management and suggests that sport management and communication consider the value of blockchain and the technology stack as the digital footprint in the industry intensifies and becomes increasingly complex.

TI Multi-Sessions Mechanism for Decentralized Cash on Delivery System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB To date, cash on delivery (COD) is one of the most popular payment methods in developing countries thanks to the blossom of customer-to-customer e-commerce. With the widespread of a very small business model and the Internet, online shopping has become part of people's daily activity. People browse for desirable products at the comfort of their homes and ask the online vendor that a shipper can deliver the merchandise at their doorstep. Then, COD allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their desired location. Since customers receive goods before making a payment, COD is, therefore, considered as a payment system. However, the crucial issue that previous research has not yet addressed is that their models only support single delivering session at a time. More precisely, if the current buyer is not available to receive the goods, the shipper has to wastefully wait for the complete payment and he/she cannot start shipping another merchandise. The tracking system seems to poorly handle this issue. In particular, we propose a multi-session mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and transparent across delivering sessions in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism ensure the efficiency of delivering process. The authors release our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. We conclude that the integration of multi-session mechanism and blockchain technology will cause significant efficiency across several disciplines.

The invention improves the accuracy of the node data packet forwarding of the wireless sensor network of the ship, and performs the self-adaptive distributed deployment design of the trust node in the ship wireless sensor network, and the random link forwarding protocol is adopted to construct a routing detection model of the ship wireless sensor network, the self-adaptive forwarding control of the network trust node and the characteristic detection of the output data packet are carried out by adopting a decentralized block chain reconstruction method, the association rule information of the output data stream of the ship wireless sensor network node is extracted. The trust evaluation and adaptive control of the wireless sensor network node of the ship are carried out in combination with the large-data information fusion method, and the trust evaluation of the wireless sensor network node of the ship is realized. The simulation results show that the accuracy of the network node trust evaluation of the ship wireless sensor is high, the adaptability is good, and the accuracy of the packet forwarding of the network trust node of the ship wireless sensor is improved.

SO JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES
AB The future health-care system will contain an ever expanding number of digital elements. The data stored both at a centralized health-care level and at a local, patient level (e.g., on a smartphone) will be core elements when deciding treatment strategies in a health-care scenario with Internet of things-based elements. The current way of manufacturing pharmaceutical products and related existing logistic-solutions is not ready for such a revolution. One of the key challenges is cybersecurity and related robust public key infrastructure solution. This work introduces one element of a potential solution at a prototype level: the concept of cryptopharmaceuticals where pharmaceutical products are connected in a patient-specific blockchain of individual dosage units. This technology is based on the concept where each produced dosage unit has a unique information-rich pattern. A proof-of-concept smartphone application was applied to demonstrate the visualization of this blockchain at different levels. This includes the manufacturing of the individualized dosage unit, the patient view for his/her personal blockchain, and integration of these products into a health Internet of things system. This unbreakable blockchain of personal medication history will provide means to avoid counterfeit products and to enable innovative logistic solutions. (c) 2019 American Pharmacists Association (R).

TI Safeguarding a formalized Blockchain-enabled identity-authentication
   protocol by applying security risk-oriented patterns
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Designing government independent and secure identification- and authentication protocols is a challenging task. Design flaws and missing specifications as well as security- and privacy issues of such protocols pose considerable user risks. Formal methods, such as Colored Petri Nets (CPN), are utilised for the design, development and analysis of such new protocols in order to detect flaws and mitigate identified security risks before deployment. This paper fills the gap, by applying in a novel way a set of security risk-oriented patterns (SRP) to the so-called Authcoin protocol that we formalise using CPN. The initial formal model of Authcoin facilitates the detection and elimination of design flaws, missing specifications as well as security- and privacy issues. The additional risk- and threat analysis based on the Information Systems Security Risk Management (ISSRM) domain model we perform on the formal CPN models of the protocol. The identified risks are mitigated by applying SRPs to the formal model of the Authcoin protocol. SRPs are a means to mitigate common security- and privacy risks in a business-process context by applying thoroughly tested and proven best-practice solutions. The goal of this work is to test the utility of SRPs outside of the the usual application domain, to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities of the Authcoin protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI DAG-Based Distributed Ledger for Low-Latency Smart Grid Network
SO ENERGIES
AB In this paper, we propose a scheme that implements a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) based on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to generate, validate, and confirm the electricity transaction in Smart Grid. The convergence of the Smart Grid and distributed ledger concept has recently been introduced. Since Smart Grids require a distributed network architecture for power distribution and trading, the Distributed Ledger-based Smart Grid design is a spotlighted research domain. However, only the Blockchain-based methods, which are a type of the distributed ledger scheme, are currently either being considered or adopted in the Smart Grid. Due to computation-intensive consensus schemes such as Proof-of-Work and discrete block generation, Blockchain-based distributed ledger systems suffer from efficiency and latency issues. We propose a DAG-based distributed ledger for Smart Grids, called PowerGraph, to resolve this problem. Since a DAG-based distributed ledger does not need to generate blocks for confirmation, each transaction of the PowerGraph undergoes the validation and confirmation process individually. In addition, transactions in PowerGraph are used to keep track of the energy trade and include various types of transactions so that they can fully encompass the events in the Smart Grid network. Finally, to ensure that PowerGraph maintains a high performance, we modeled the PowerGraph performance and proposed a novel consensus algorithm that would result in the rapid confirmation of transactions. We use numerical evaluations to show that PowerGraph can accelerate the transaction processing speed by over 5 times compared to existing DAG-based DLT system.

TI Achieving Portfolio Diversification through Cryptocurrencies in European
   Markets
SO BUSINESS SYSTEMS RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB Background: Cryptocurrencies represent a specific technological innovation in financial markets that keeps getting more and more popular among investors around the world. Given the specific characteristics of the cryptocurrencies, this paper examines the possibility of their use as a diversification instrument. Objectives: This paper examines the direction and strength of the relationship between the selected cryptocurrencies and important financial indicators on the European Union market. Since cryptocurrencies are a novelty in the financial system, the empirical literature in this area is rather scarce. Methods/Approach: In order to assess diversification properties of cryptocurrencies for European traders, a comprehensive econometric analysis was carried out. The first part of the analysis refers to the estimation of the multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, whereas the second part focuses on wavelet transforms. Results: Bitcoin and Ripple proved as a possible diversification instrument on most of the observed European markets since corresponding coefficients of unconditional correlation are negative. Conclusions: The relationship between the value of the cryptocurrencies and selected indices is generally very weak and slightly negative, indicating that some cryptocurrencies can serve as a means of diversification. However, investors need to take into account the extreme volatility, exhibited in all existing cryptocurrencies.

TI Are cryptocurrency traders pioneers or just risk-seekers? Evidence from
   brokerage accounts
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Are cryptocurrency traders driven by a desire to invest in a new asset class to diversify their portfolio or are they merely seeking to increase their levels of risk? To answer this question, we use individual-level brokerage data and study their behavior in stock trading around the time they engage in their first cryptocurrency trade. We find that when engaging in cryptocurrency trading investors simultaneously increase their risk-seeking behavior in stock trading as they increase their trading intensity and use of leverage. The increase in risk-seeking in stocks is particularly pronounced when volatility in cryptocurrency returns is low, suggesting that their overall behavior is driven by excitement-seeking.

TI Blockchain-based platforms: Decentralized infrastructures and its
   boundary conditions
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Blockchain technology has been receiving much public attention recently, promising to disintermediate transactions through decentralized governance and distributed data-infrastructures. However, the majority of the previous studies have focused on the technical aspects, and overlooked blockchain investigation from a managerial perspective. In this paper, based on platform-ecosystem, transaction cost economics, and open-source literature, we contrast and compare blockchain-based platforms and centralized platforms; in other words, decentralized versus centralized governance modes. We base our conceptual analysis on three dimensions-transaction cost, cost of technology, and community involvement-, exploring the conditions under which blockchain-based platforms are more advantageous than centralized platforms. We first compare gains from lower opportunism and uncertainty costs thanks to protocols and smart contracts in blockchain technology versus the costs of higher coordination and complexity of (re)writing those contracts. Second, we compare the gains from immutability and transparency in blockchain-based platforms versus the technological costs of verification and storage of a distributed ledger. Finally, we compare intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of the communities around centralized and blockchain-based platforms in the short and medium term.

TI Revisiting the formation of the legal status of cryptocurrency in the
   Russian legislation
SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
AB The paper provides insight in to the concept of cryptocurrency as considered by national and foreign authors, the principles of its functioning and the need to establish its legal status. Formulated is the definition of cryptocurrency, and the thesis that cryptocurrency can be classified as "other property" is grounded. The need for an official legislative definition of cryptocurrency attributes to the growth of transactions, cryptocurrencies trading at "official" marketplaces, and a change in the Russian government' sattitude towards cryptocurrencies from its banning to acceptance. One of the threats to the cryptocurrency turnover in financial markets was its "imaginary" anonymity -it has been generally accepted that cryptocurrency transactions are completely anonymous. However, all transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, and the key problem is to identify the account holder. Thus, it is not the account holder's identity that is anonymous, but rather an actual transaction. In our opinion, this problem can be solved by applying a series of computer-aided tests.

AB The modern agglomerations development remains under the influence of current global trends: economic, environmental/climate, social, technological, geopolitical ones. At least six forces are expected to further disrupt the urban mobility landscape, especially coastal one. From self-driving vehicles and the sharing economy, to vehicle electrification, mobile computing, the Internet of Things and Block-chain technologies, each of these trends is quite significant on its own. The actions undertaken by city authorities aim at focusing citizens' attention on the need to improve air quality, decrease congestion in city's main streets, invest in one's health and physical condition, which increases the level of quality of life, and in turn provides the city with considerable economic benefits. The purpose of the paper is to explore global trends shaping life quality in coastal agglomerations with a special regard to sustainable mobility and to present the ISO 37120 - a tool allowing measurement, based on the indicators, of the cities resilience and performance.

TI Distributed ledger technology and European Union General Data Protection
   Regulation compliance in a flexible working context
SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Compliance of distributed ledger technology (DLT) based solutions with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) is currently a hot topic both from a technical point of view, as well as from a legal and normative one. Flexible working is a new working model where employees can perform their work activity without specific time and space constraints. In this context privacy and information trustworthiness are relevant and, therefore, on the one hand it can gain benefit from using DLT based solutions, on the other hand it must comply with the GDPR. This paper describes a solution that combines DLTs and the new Ciphertext-Policy Attribute Based Encryption cryptographic techniques to support compliance with the EU GDPR in the context of flexible working. The devised solution is being concretely experimented, in the context of the EU H2020 CITADEL project, by the Municipality of Bari (Italy).

TI Assessing the security implication of Bitcoin exchange rates
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Cryptographic assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum provide distributed consensus with a Proof-of-Work protocol and incentive-based engineering. The consensus is inherently dependent on the value of the asset due to the incentives. The value of these assets frequently fluctuates, which in turn influences the incentive component of the consensus mechanism. For a proof-of-work consensus to be secure, the participation reward must have a perceived real-world value. The future of this perception is not at all clear. The recent 70% drop in the value of Bitcoin versus the US Dollar may be precipitating a circle of declining security of the platform which we explore in depth in this paper. In this paper, we analyze the impact of fluctuations on the security of Bitcoin now, and in the future. We introduce a novel method to examine the rationale of a miner based on the price fluctuations. We integrate our method with an existing security evaluation framework and simulator. Using our approach, we determine and report on the impact of the value of the cryptographic asset on the security of the blockchain given the miner's rationale. Our method allows us to evaluate the impact of different methods of incentive manipulation such as reduced block-reward and transaction fees, by simulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The typical characteristics of a blockchain such as its claimed immutability raise new questions as to what preventive measures can reasonably be demanded from blockchain intermediaries, and managers of nodes in particular. The article asks whether the exemptions introduced in the Directive on e-Commerce can be applied, what mitigating or preventive measures other than Notice-and-Takedown can be applied and how governmental regulators should react.

TI A Lightweight Hash-Based Blockchain Architecture for Industrial IoT
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Blockchain is a technology that can ensure data integrity in a distributed network, and it is actively applied in various fields. Recently, blockchain is gaining attention due to combining with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology in the industrial field. Moreover, many researchers have proposed the Industrial IoT (IIoT) architecture with blockchain for data integrity and efficient management. The IIoT network consists of many heterogeneous devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, and programmable logic controllers (PLC)) with resources-constrained, and the availability of the network must be preferentially considered. Therefore, applying the existed blockchain technology is still challenging. There are some results about the technique of constructing blockchain lightly to solve this challenge. However, in these results, the analysis in perspective of cryptographic performance (area, throughput, and power consumption) has not been considered sufficiently, or only focused on the architecture of the blockchain network. The blockchain technology is based on cryptographic techniques, and the main part is a cryptographic hash function. Therefore, if we construct the blockchain-based IIoT architecture, we have to consider the performance of the hash function. Many lightweight hash functions have been proposed recently for the resource-constrained environment, and it can also be used to the blockchain. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the considerations of lightweight blockchain for IIoT. Also, we conduct an analysis of lightweight hash for blockchain, and propose a new lightweight hash-based blockchain architecture that can change the hash algorithm used for mining adjust to network traffic.

TI Privacy-Preserving Image Retrieval for Medical IoT Systems: A
   Blockchain-Based Approach
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB With the advent of medical IoT devices, the types and volumes of medical images have significantly increased. Retrieving of medical images is of great importance to facilitate disease diagnosis and improve treatment efficiency. However, it may raise privacy concerns from individuals, since medical images contain patients' sensitive and private information. Existing studies on retrieval of medical data either fail to protect sensitive information of medical images or are limited to a single image data provider. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based system for medical image retrieval with privacy protection. We first describe the typical scenarios of medical image retrieval and summarize the corresponding requirements in system design. Using the emerging blockchain techniques, we present the layered architecture and threat model of the proposed system. In order to accommodate large-size images with storage-constrained blocks, we capture a carefully selected feature vector from each medical image and design a customized transaction structure, which protects the privacy of medical images and image features. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities of future research.

TI Blockchains for Secure Digitized Medicine
SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB Blockchain as an emerging technology has been gaining in popularity, with more possible applications to utilize the technology in the near future. With the offer of a decentralized, distributed environment without the need for a third trusted party (TTP), blockchains are being used to solve issues in systems that are susceptible to cyberattacks. One possible field that could benefit from blockchains that researchers have been focusing on is healthcare. Current healthcare information systems face several challenges, such as fragmented patient data, centralized systems which are viewed as single points of attacks, and the lack of patient-oriented services. In this paper, we investigate and analyze recent literature related to the use of blockchains to tackle issues found in modern healthcare information systems. This is done to understand issues that researchers commonly focus on, to discover remaining areas of concern in any proposed solution, and to understand the possible directions of the integration of blockchains in healthcare and personalized medicine. Background information regarding blockchains and existing healthcare information systems is reviewed, followed by the methodology used in the preparation of this review, where the research questions to consider are stated. Afterwards, an analysis of the results is provided, concluding with a discussion of the remaining issues that need to be focused on, and how blockchains could benefit the healthcare sector and empower personalized medicine.

In this paper, we propose important safeguard measures against this threat by developing a framework of a quantum-secured, permissioned blockchain called Logicontract (LC). LC adopts a digital signature scheme based on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) mechanisms and a vote-based consensus algorithm to achieve consensus on the blockchain. The main contribution of this paper is in the development of: (1) unconditionally secure signature scheme for LC which makes it immune to the attack of quantum computers; (2) scalable consensus protocol used by LC; (3) logic-based scripting language for the creation of smart contracts on LC; (4) quantum-resistant lottery protocol which illustrates the power and usage of LC.

To deal with time-varying variance, we develop two corresponding tests by wild bootstrap algorithm. The bootstrap-based tests achieve asymptotic validity in the presence of time-varying volatility. Simulations show that the bootstrap tests perform well in finite samples. Applying our proposed method to the Bitcoin and the Chinese stock market, we find evidence that the Bitcoin market is isolated from the Chinese stock market. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Given the unique features of the crypto asset market, we find that conventional regression models exhibit strong model specification uncertainty. To circumvent this issue, we suggest using least squares model-averaging methods to model and forecast Bitcoin volatility. The empirical results demonstrate that least squares model-averaging methods in general outperform many other conventional regression models that ignore specification uncertainty.

TI Smart contract for secure billing in ride-hailing service via blockchain
SO PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS
AB Ride-hailing service is gaining an increasing popularity due to its great advantages on fare estimation, automatic payments, and reputation ratings. However, how to build the trust between the driver and the passenger and achieve the secure billing still remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel secure billing protocol which removes the presence of the online third party by a smart contract on a publicly-verifiable two-party blockchain. In the proposed secure billing protocol, the driver and the passenger generate a blockchain which contains information about the ride. The driver and the passenger measure their own trajectories respectively in rounds. At the end of each round, they exchange their trajectories of the current round. If the difference of trajectories is within a threshold, they jointly compute the fare of current round. After completing the computation, the passenger pays the driver the fare of the current round via a micropayment channel. The driver and the passenger end each round by adding the information generated in this round into the blockchain. The blockchain can be considered as an evidence of the ride since it contains all the information of the ride. We evaluate the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol via extensive experiments and detailed analysis.

TI Edge Intelligence and Blockchain Empowered 5G Beyond for the Industrial
   Internet of Things
SO IEEE NETWORK
AB Edge intelligence is a key enabler for IIoT as it offers smart cloud services in close proximity to the production environment with low latency and less cost. The need for ubiquitous communication, computing, and caching resources in 5G beyond will lead to a growing demand to integrate heterogeneous resources into the edge network. Furthermore, distributed edge services can make resource transactions vulnerable to malicious nodes. Ensuring secure edge services under complex industrial networks is a big challenge. In this article, we present an edge intelligence and blockchain empowered IIoT framework, which achieves flexible and secure edge service management. Then we propose a cross-domain sharing inspired edge resource scheduling scheme and design a credit-differentiated edge transaction approval mechanism. Numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes bring significant improvement in both edge service cost and service capacities.

TI A game-theoretic method based on Q-learning to invalidate criminal smart
   contracts
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB Criminal smart contracts, severely threatening the security of cyberspace, allow criminals to maximize their utilities through illegal behaviors. The validity of criminal smart contracts is an indicator of criminals' success. While the validity of criminal smart contracts heavily hinges on parameters derived from data feed. Therefore, criminals have incentives to increase these contracts' validity by biasing the parameters therein. In this paper, we formalize data feed parameters by utilizing stochastic distributions, allowing us to analyze criminal smart contracts as state-based games and evaluate their validity through state arrival probabilities. The main target of this paper is to decrease the validity of criminal smart contracts to prevent criminals' illegal behaviors. To this end, Q-learning is utilized to train distribution parameters so that criminals have a low probability of reaching their desirable state. This impairs the validity of criminal smart contracts and minimizes criminals' utilities. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first implementation of machine learning in the analysis of smart contracts. The experiments show that our method is at least an order of magnitude lower than previous works under the same settings with respect to the validity of criminal smart contracts.

TI Consensus aware manufacturing service collaboration optimization under
   blockchain based Industrial Internet platform
SO COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING
AB To realize collaboration among distributed enterprises, manufacturing service collaboration on Industrial Internet platform is an efficient method. However, the low degree of participation resulted by the sense of distrust, dissatisfaction, and insecurity hinders the widely application of Industrial Internet platform. Therefore, a secure, trustworthy, and multi-user satisfied manufacturing service collaboration method is in urgent need. A blockchain based platform could be utilized to support collaboration among distributed participants to complete trustworthy transactions. In addition, in order to satisfy multiple users, there should be a suitable collaboration mechanism that allows interest-independent participants to fulfil their short/long-term expectations and guide them to a consensus. Based on the establishment of the underlying data and network layer of the blockchain, the collaboration optimization of manufacturing services based on consensus is proposed. By utilizing Memetic algorithm, both the long-term utility of providers and the short-term utility of consumers are combined to choose the optimal providers for the tasks. The providers are selected with higher satisfaction degree of consumers.

TI Z-Channel: Scalable and efficient scheme in Zerocash
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Decentralized ledger-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin present a way to construct payment systems without trusted banks. However, the anonymity of Bitcoin is fragile. Many altcoins and protocols are designed to improve Bitcoin on this issue, among which Zero cash is the first full-fledged anonymous ledger-based currency, using zero-knowledge proof, specifically zk-SNARK, to protect privacy. However, Zerocash suffers two problems: Poor scalability and low efficiency. In this paper, we address the above issues by constructing a micropayment system in Zerocash called Z-Channel. First, we improve Zerocash to support multisignature and time lock functionalities, and prove that the reconstructed scheme is secure. Then we construct Z-Channel based on the improved Zerocash scheme. Our experiments demonstrate that Z-Channel significantly improves the scalability and reduces the confirmation time for Zerocash payments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Enforcing trustworthy cloud SLA with witnesses: A game theory-based
   model using smart contracts
SO CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB There lacks trust between the cloud customer and provider to enforce traditional cloud SLA (Service Level Agreement) where the blockchain technique seems a promising solution. However, current explorations still face challenges to prove that the off-chain SLO (Service Level Objective) violations really happen before recorded into the on-chain transactions. In this paper, a witness model is proposed implemented with smart contracts to solve this trust issue. The introduced role, "Witness", gains rewards as an incentive for performing the SLO violation report, and the payoff function is carefully designed in a way that the witness has to tell the truth, for maximizing the rewards. This fact that the witness has to be honest is analyzed and proved using the Nash Equilibrium principle of game theory. For ensuring the chosen witnesses are random and independent, an unbiased selection algorithm is proposed to avoid possible collusions. An auditing mechanism is also introduced to detect potential malicious witnesses. Specifically, we define three types of malicious behaviors and propose quantitative indicators to audit and detect these behaviors. Moreover, experimental studies based on Ethereum blockchain demonstrate the proposed model is feasible, and indicate that the performance, ie, transaction fee, of each interface follows the design expectations.

TI Med-PPPHIS: Blockchain-Based Personal Healthcare Information System for
   National Physique Monitoring and Scientific Exercise Guiding
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB The dissemination of electronic medical data among professional personnel has been perceived to be an important breakthrough for the discovery of new technologies and therapies for curing diseases. However, in the current medical data management, it is difficult to share medical data due to the fragmentation of medical data and the lack of effective sharing methods. On the other hand, the security of medical data is difficult to protect because the centralized data storage is vulnerable to attack and tampering. Therefore, we propose a model called Med-PPPHIS, which consists of a permission-less blockchain and a permissioned blockchain, named Med-DLattice, to serve the management of user's personal health information and form a chained protection mechanism for medical data. Med-DLattice features Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, where each account updates its Account-DAG asynchronously to other unrelated accounts. The Med-DLattice nodes can reach an efficient consensus with proposed DPoS-Quorum algorithm. Based on this model, by converting the medical data into on-chain tokens, a safe and efficient channel for data circulation is established, while the privacy of data is secured. We implement a prototype of Med-PPPHIS and introduce a blockchain-based closed-loop method for chronic disease management, which initially applies the model to national physique monitoring in Anhui Province, China. The performance of the model is evaluated by simulating 500 nodes on 25 AliCloud ECS virtual machines. Experimental result shows that Med-PPPHIS has low latency and high throughput, and the security analysis shows that the model is able to prevent Sybil attacks, DDoS attacks, etc.

TI MMOG User Participation Based Decentralized Consensus Scheme and Proof
   of Participation Analysis on the Bryllite Blockchain System
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Proof of Work (PoW) based blockchains have limitations in throughput, time consumption, and energy efficiency. In these systems, a miner will consume significant time and resources to obtain a reward for contributing to the blockchain. To overcome these limitations, recent research on blockchains are focused on accelerating the speed, scalability, and enhancing the security level. By enhancing specific procedures of blockchain system, the level of data integrity supported by the blockchain can become more robust, and efficient. In this paper, a new blockchain consensus model based on the Bryllite Consensus Protocol (BCP) is proposed to support a hyper-connected massively multiplayer online game (MMOG) ecosystem. The BCP scheme enables users to participate directly in new consensus processes through a Proof of Participation (PoP) algorithm. In this model, the consensus algorithm has a simpler form while maintaining high security level. In addition, because the BCP scheme gives users an equal chance to make a contribution to the blockchain, rewards are distributed in an equal fashion, which motivates user participation. The analysis of the proposed scheme is applied to the Bryllite consortium blockchain system (homed in Hong Kong), which is a new blockchain network developed for international game industries, gamers, and game events.

SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper first evaluates the volatility modeling in the Bitcoin market in terms of its realized volatility, which is considered to be a reliable proxy of its true volatility. Based on the 5-minute return of Bitcoin, the proxy of its true volatility is computed as the sum of the squared intraday returns. To evaluate the performance of volatility modeling, this paper relies on MSE and QLIKE, which are the measures for making the forecast accuracy robust to noise in the imperfect volatility proxy, while different measures are also used for the robustness check. The empirically findings summarized as (1) the asymmetric volatility models such as EGARCH and APARCH have a higher predictability, and (2) the volatility model with normal distribution performs better than the fat-tailed distribution such as skewed t distribution.

TI A Blockchain Framework for Patient-Centered Health Records and Exchange
   (HealthChain): Evaluation and Proof-of-Concept Study
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Blockchain has the potential to disrupt the current modes of patient data access, accumulation, contribution, exchange, and control. Using interoperability standards, smart contracts, and cryptographic identities, patients can securely exchange data with providers and regulate access. The resulting comprehensive, longitudinal medical records can significantly improve the cost and quality of patient care for individuals and populations alike.
   Objective: This work presents HealthChain, a novel patient-centered blockchain framework. The intent is to bolster patient engagement, data curation, and regulated dissemination of accumulated information in a secure, interoperable environment. A mixed-block blockchain is proposed to support immutable logging and redactable patient blocks. Patient data are generated and exchanged through Health Level-7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, allowing seamless transfer with compliant systems. In addition, patients receive cryptographic identities in the form of public and private key pairs. Public keys are stored in the blockchain and are suitable for securing and verifying transactions. Furthermore, the envisaged system uses proxy re-encryption (PRE) to share information through revocable, smart contracts, ensuring the preservation of privacy and confidentiality. Finally, several PRE improvements are offered to enhance performance and security.
   Methods: The framework was formulated to address key barriers to blockchain adoption in health care, namely, information security, interoperability, data integrity, identity validation, and scalability. It supports 16 configurations through the manipulation of 4 modes. An open-source, proof-of-concept tool was developed to evaluate the performance of the novel patient block components and system configurations. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework and evaluate resource consumption, extensive testing was performed on each of the 16 configurations over a variety of scenarios involving a variable number of existing and imported records.
   Results: The results indicate several clear high-performing, low-bandwidth configurations, although they are not the strongest cryptographically. Of the strongest models, one's anticipated cumulative record size is shown to influence the selection. Although the most efficient algorithm is ultimately user specific, Advanced Encryption Standard-encrypted data with static keys, incremental server storage, and no additional server-side encryption are the fastest and least bandwidth intensive, whereas proxy re-encrypted data with dynamic keys, incremental server storage, and additional server-side encryption are the best performing of the strongest configurations.
   Conclusions: Blockchain is a potent and viable technology for patient-centered access to and exchange of health information. By integrating a structured, interoperable design with patient-accumulated and generated data shared through smart contracts into a universally accessible blockchain, HealthChain presents patients and providers with access to consistent and comprehensive medical records. Challenges addressed include data security, interoperability, block storage, and patient-administered data access, with several configurations emerging for further consideration regarding speed and security.

TI NeuCheck: A more practical Ethereum smart contract security analysis
   tool
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Ethereum is one of the currently popular trading platform, where any one can exchange, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies. Smart contract, a computer program, can help Ethereum to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. Because the smart contract usually handles large number of cryptocurrencies worth billions of dollars apiece, its security has gained considerable attention. In this paper, we first investigate the security of smart contracts running on the Ethereum and introduce several new security vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to exploit and gain financial benefits. Then, we propose a more practical smart contract analysis tool termed NeuCheck, in which we introduce the syntax tree in the syntactical analyzer to complete the transformation from source code to intermediate representation, and then adopt the open source library working with XML to analyze such tree. We have built a prototype of NeuCheck for Ethereum and evaluate it with over 52 000 existing Ethereum smart contracts. The results show that (1) our new documented vulnerabilities are prevalent; (2) NeuCheck improves the analysis speed by at least 17.2 times compared to other popular analysis tools (eg, Securify and Mythril; and (3) allows for cross-platform deployment.

TI Distributed ledger technology in supply chains: a transaction cost
   perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB With the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT), numerous practitioners and researchers have proclaimed its beneficial impact on supply chain transactions in the future. However, the vast majority of DLT initiatives are discontinued after a short period. With the full potential of DLT laying far down the road, especially managers in supply chain management (SCM) seek for short-term cost-saving effects of DLT in order to achieve long-term benefits of DLT in the future. However, the extant research has bypassed grounding long-term as well as short-term effects of DLT on supply chain transaction with empirical data. We address this shortcoming, following an abductive research approach and combining empirical data from a multiple case study design with the corresponding literature. Our study reveals that the effects of DLT on supply chain transactions are two-sided. We found six effects of DLT solutions that have a cost-reducing or cost avoidance impact on supply chain transactions. In addition, we found two effects that change the power distribution between buyers and suppliers in transactions and a single effect that reduces the dependency of supply chain transactions on third parties. While cost-reducing and avoidance as well as dependency-reducing effects are positive effects, the change in power distribution might come with disadvantages. With these findings, the paper provides the first empirical evidence of the impact of DLT on supply chain transactions, which will enable managers to improve their assessment of DLT usage in supply chains.

TI Can Bitcoin become money? The monetary rule problem
SO AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS
AB The growing literature on Bitcoin can be divided into two groups. One performs an economic analysis of Bitcoin focusing on its monetary characteristics. The other one takes a financial look at the price of Bitcoin. Interestingly, both of these groups have not given much more than passing comments to the problem of whether or not Bitcoin has the right monetary rule in order to become a well-established currency. This paper argues that Bitcoin in particular, and cryptocurrencies in general, do not have a good monetary rule and that this shortcoming seriously limits its prospect of becoming widely used money.

TI Fitness preferential attachment as a driving mechanism in bitcoin
   transaction network
SO PLOS ONE
AB Bitcoin is the earliest cryptocurrency and among the most successful ones to date. Recently, its dynamical evolution has attracted the attention of the research community due to its completeness and richness in historical records. In this paper, we focus on the detailed evolution of bitcoin trading with the aim of elucidating the mechanism that drives the formation of the bitcoin transaction network. Our empirical investigation reveals that although the temporal properties of the transaction network possesses scale-free degree distribution like many other networks, its formation mechanism is different from the commonly assumed models of degree preferential attachment or wealth preferential attachment. By defining the fitness value of each node as the ability of the node to attract new connections, we have instead uncovered that the observed scale-free degree distribution results from the intrinsic fitness of each node following a power-law distribution. Our finding thus suggests that the "good-get-richer" rather than the "rich-get-richer" paradigm operates within the bitcoin ecosystem. Based on these findings, we propose a model that captures the temporal generative process by means of a fitness preferential attachment and data-driven birth/death mechanism. Our proposed model is able to produce structural properties in good agreement with those obtained from the empirical bitcoin network.

TI 'Immanent Nation: The Rohingya quest for international recognition'
SO NATIONS AND NATIONALISM
AB This paper lies at the intersection of scholarly literatures on forced migration, politically engaged diasporas, and the use of online platforms and digital technologies for political ends. It follows the efforts of a group of Rohingya diasporic activists using a variety of means, online and offline, to contest the claims and authority of Myanmar, an established territorial state. Their actions can be subsumed into two kinds of politics, a politics of confrontation and a politics of recognition. Taken together, these actions lead to an emergent political formation, a reterritorialised, dispersed, and virtual national community that seeks to mimic some state functions without explicitly calling for self-determination or an independent nation-state. This paper follows four activist projects: YouTube-based Rohingya TV, the effort to join the ConIFA alternative World Football Cup tournament, the campaign to have the Rohingya script recognized by the Unicode Consortium, and the effort to build a database for undocumented Rohingyas using blockchain. This complex of social, political, electronic, and virtual relations is situated against a 20th century political imaginary built around the homeland-people-language trinity, dialectically producing an immanent contradiction.

TI Cryptocurrency: present-day challenges and prospects of development
SO ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB Due to digitalisation processes in economic, civic and social areas, we observe acceleration in certain processes, in particular the saturation of the financial market with modern digital means, including cryptocurrencies, which has led to the choice of the subject for the present article.
   This article is aimed at the analysis and systematisation of the notion of cryptocurrency on the basis of selected digital and electronic money characteristics, including the determination of its place in the system of market values along with the classification of approaches to the regulation of cryptocurrency flows in European countries. Also this paper provides an individual interpretation of Burniske's formula to calculate the cryptocurrency monetary supply at global financial markets.
   The research stipulates the use of morphological and synthesis, structural and functional, and comparative legal types of analyses, including generalisation.
   The paper provides an analysis of the category and concept framework of digital currencies, in particular cryptocurrencies from the standpoint of tools used to develop the crypto infrastructure. The electronic currency as a means of value has certain advantages, if compared to the fiat currency, yet a lack of proper legal mechanism leads to collapse in its functioning in the financial market. It is also established that cryptocurrencies have high volatility resulting in the limitation of its functioning in certain states (Ecuador, Iceland, India, China, etc). The authors reveal characteristics and legal content of Burniske's formula which justifies the proportional relation between the product of currency flow velocity and gross monetary supply and the product of monetary supply price and circulation volume.
   National legislation must identify cryptocurrency as a financial means - an alternative for the unstable banking system and extension of economic rights of individuals and legal entities.

TI Cryptocurrencies vs global foreign exchange risk
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose This study aims to examine the properties of four major cryptocurrencies and how they can be used as a simpler alternative mode of hedging foreign exchange (FX) risks as compared to existing mainstream financial risk management techniques. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a combination of visual data representations and the classic Fama and Macbeth (1973) two-pass procedure regressions. Findings The findings show that cryptocurrencies can be a more effective hedge against FX risks as compared to other common hedging instruments and/or techniques such as gold or a diversified currency portfolio. Research limitations/implications - The conclusions were arrived at based only on a small group of cryptocurrency, i.e. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Ripple. Other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin or ZCash might exhibit different properties. Practical implications - Cryptocurrencies can be cost-effective and cost-efficient instruments that provide a solid hedge for investors and/or firms that are exposed to global FX volatility. Its ease of trade and virtually zero barriers to entry makes it an easily accessible alternative hedge instrument as compared to more complex items such as derivatives. Originality/value If cryptocurrencies are to be accepted into mainstream usage, a detailed examination of its various uses is necessary. In particular, as they are often touted to be the future of currency, its properties and price behavior relative to other mainstream financial instruments need to be well-understood, not only by finance professionals but also by laypersons.

A blockchain is a distributed database of records in the form of encrypted blocks, or a public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties and can be verified at any time in the future. Generally, the robust and decentralized functionality of the blockchain is used for global financial systems, but it can easily be expanded to contracts and operations such as tracking of the global supply chain. In the precision agriculture context, Information and Communications Technology can be further implemented with a blockchain infrastructure to enable new farm systems and e-agriculture schemes. RESULTS The purpose of this review is to show a panorama of the scientific studies (enriched by a terms mapping analysis) on the use of blockchain in the agri-food sector, from both an entirely computational and an applicative point of view. As evidenced by the network analysis, the reviewed studies mainly focused on software aspects (e.g. the architecture and smart contracts). However, some aspects regarding the different blockchain knots (computers always connected to the blockchain network) having the role to store and distribute an updated copy of each block in a food supply-chain, result of crucial importance. CONCLUSION These technologies appear very promising and rich of great potential showing a good flexibility for applications in several sectors but still immature and hard to apply due to their complexity.

TI Bitcoin mining: converting computing power into cash flow
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Bitcoin is the world's leading cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization briefly exceeding $300 billion. This hints at Bitcoin's amorphous nature: Is this a monetary or a corporate measure? Hard values become explicit in the processing of transactions and the digital mining of Bitcoins. Electricity is a primary input cost. Bitcoins earned are often used to circumvent local currency controls and acquire US dollars. For the period August 2010 to February 2018, we examine the financial components of Bitcoin mining revenues, their statistical contribution to daily changes, and to its variance. We provide empirical evidence that Bitcoin transaction processing is capacity constrained.

AB This study explores a mixed model for the factors promoting the use of cryptocurrencies. This research has conducted by theoretical saturation, exploratory factor analysis and the Fridman test. According to the findings, thirty-one factors affect cryptocurrency usage. The results revealed that the central banks in developing countries, commercial banks, financial institutions, financial and business managers, public policymakers, and even the general public can capitalize on these factors. This study also explored a model developed based on the EFA that confirmed the positive effect of three factors on the level of cryptocurrency usage, namely the technological skills, technological ambiguity, and technological advantages. For the first time, the present study models the consumption factors of cryptocurrencies and ranks them from the consumers' perspective. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Applying Blockchain to the Australian Carbon Market
SO ECONOMIC PAPERS
AB Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger system that establishes transparent contract processes and facilitates secure but trusted business transactions. Policy-makers around the world are intrigued by the potential of this emerging technology to solve policy problems, including the challenges of the transition away from centralised, linear models of energy generation and consumption towards decentralised and distributed energy systems. Blockchain has also been promoted as a mechanism to transform carbon markets, yet the focus in this area to date has been on using blockchain to create new carbon market schemes. This paper addresses an important research gap by asking how blockchain could be applied to an existing carbon market. To answer this question, the study uses an established design process to develop an Australian carbon market blockchain design. The paper finds that this design could improve the efficiency, equity and effectiveness of the Australian carbon market. This paper makes an important research contribution to carbon market policy development by developing a blockchain design that could improve how an existing carbon market functions, and the findings presented here are relevant to government and industry stakeholders globally.

TI "Soft law" and innovations: empirical analysis of ICO-related statements
SO DIGITAL POLICY REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of the paper is to explore the initial coin offering (ICO) statements as "soft law" instrument used to regulate disruptive innovations. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on the qualitative content analysis of 40 ICO statements issued by regulators in 37 countries by applying a custom-made coding table. Findings The research shows that "soft law" is used predominantly by high-capacity jurisdictions. "Soft law" allows for more flexibility and less technological and business neutrality. The findings also show the contradiction between empirical evidence and public sentiment: it seems that the widespread notion that virtual currencies have connotations with money laundering/financing of terrorism (ML/FT) is not shared by the regulators, who are more concerned by the fraud. Finally, it was found that the standard-setting bodies are lagging behind in providing guidance on the emergence technologies.
   Originality/value This is the first in-depth research of the ICO-related statements as "soft law" instruments. It also offers a new perspective on the issue of financial innovations regulation.

TI Integrated innovative product design and supply chain tactical planning
   within a blockchain platform
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB In globalised manufacturing and production environments, companies increasingly tend to exploit public contribution advantages within designing, manufacturing and marketing processes. To be benefited from outbound capabilities, this paper presents a tactical supply chain planning model to integrate the designing process in the form of open innovation within the supply chain main processes. In this regard, a fuzzy mathematical model is proposed to optimise the tactical decisions according to supply chain objectives and open innovation considerations. On the other hand, intellectual property issues and protecting the rights of innovators are significant concerns that sometimes avoid companies to be engaged in open innovation initiatives. Therefore, this paper proposes a registering mechanism in which the ideas and creative works are collected, refined and finally approved within a blockchain platform. Furthermore, in order to deal with epistemic environmental uncertainty, the fuzzy set theory is utilised. To investigate the applicability of the developed model, a case study in home appliances domain is employed. The results show that the company can achieve favourable designs by spending approximately 1% of the supply chain total cost. Additionally, benefiting the registering mechanism can decrease the cost of using non-original designs more than 41%.

TI Modelling the dynamics of Bitcoin and Litecoin: GARCH versus stochastic
   volatility models
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS
AB We examine and compare a large number of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) and stochastic volatility (SV) models using series of Bitcoin and Litecoin price returns to assess the model fit for dynamics of these cryptocurrency price returns series. The various models examined include the standard GARCH(1,1) and SV with an AR(1) log-volatility process, as well as more flexible models with jumps, volatility in mean, leverage effects, t-distributed and moving average innovations. We report that the best model for Bitcoin is SV-t while it is GARCH-t for Litecoin. Overall, the t-class of models performs better than other classes for both cryptocurrencies. For Bitcoin, the SV models consistently outperform the GARCH models and the same holds true for Litecoin in most cases. Finally, the comparison of GARCH models with GARCH-GJR models reveals that the leverage effect is not significant for cryptocurrencies, suggesting that these do not behave like stock prices.

TI Carnival in the global village: Re-imagining information infrastructures
SO INFORMATION SOCIETY
AB Infrastructures are typically seen as boring and serious, and are routinely depicted using metaphors from transportation. We argue that the carnival is a fruitful metaphor for understanding emerging information infrastructures, as the information age is also the age of the carnival. We distinguish between the ubiquitous or distal carnival and its particular manifestations - the proximate carnival - both of which are characterized by play, anarchy, dissimulation, vulgar language, and excessive consumption. The article focuses on Bitcoin, which we see as a nascent information infrastructure and an exemplary instance of a proximate carnival. It also considers how the carnival metaphor might help us reimagine our study of the information age.

TI Comparison of blockchain frameworks for healthcare applications
SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Though a relatively new technology, blockchain has become a very trendy topic in recent times, thanks to bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies which are built on the blockchain. With features such as decentralized consensus and data immutability, blockchain transactions are known to be transparent, secure, and trustworthy. For these reasons, blockchain is increasingly being adopted in different industries and for diverse use cases, especially where security and trust are important concerns. Health care is one such industry that offers several use cases for applying blockchain technology. Even so, blockchain-based healthcare applications have yet to become widespread. This is mostly because initial efforts were focused on developing blockchain frameworks for cryptocurrencies and not for general purpose applications, such as health care. Recently, general-purpose blockchain frameworks, which may be used to develop healthcare applications, have begun to emerge. However, there is no consensus on which framework is most suitable for developing healthcare applications. In light of this, this paper compares the popular general-purpose blockchain frameworks, vis-a-vis the requirements for healthcare systems, in order to guide health informatics researchers and practitioners in selecting the appropriate platform for developing and experimenting with blockchain-based healthcare applications.

TI The effect of symmetric and asymmetric information on volatility
   structure of crypto-currency markets A case study of bitcoin currency
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMIC POLICY
AB Purpose This paper aims to examine whether the crypto-currencies' market returns are symmetric or asymmetric informative, through analysing the daily logarithmic returns of bitcoin currency over the period of 2011-2017. Design/methodology/approach In doing so, the symmetric informative analysis is estimated by applying the generalised auto-regressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) (1,1) model, whereas asymmetric informative or leverage effects analysis is estimated by exponential GARCH (1,1), asymmetric power ARCH (1,1) and threshold GARCH (1,1) models. In addition, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in mean (GARCH-M (1,1)) was applied to examine whether the risk-return trade-off phenomenon was persistent in crypto-currencies market. Findings The main findings indicate that bitcoin market return or volatility is symmetric informative and has a long memory to persist in the future. Furthermore, the sympatric volatility is found to be more sensitive to its past values (lagged) than to the new shock of the market values. However, asymmetric informative response of volatility to the negative and the positive shocks do not exist in the bitcoin market or, in other words, there is no leverage effect. This suggests that the bitcoin market is in harmony with the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) with respect to the asymmetric information and violated the EMH with regard to the symmetric information. Hence, the market price or return of bitcoin currency could not be predicted by simply exercising such past market information in the short-run investment. In addition, the estimated coefficient of conditional variance or risk premium (lambda) in the mean equation of CHARCH-M (1,1) model is positive however, statistically insignificant. This indicates the absence of risk-return trade-off, in which case the higher market risk will not essentially lead to higher market returns. This paper has proposed that an investment in the crypto-currency market is more appropriate for risk-averse investors than risk takers. Originality/value The findings of the study will provide investors with necessary information about the bitcoin market price efficiency, hedging effectiveness and risk management.

TI Is bitcoin a near stock? Linear and non-linear causal evidence from a
   price-volume relationship
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the price-volume relationship in the bitcoin market to validate near-stock properties of bitcoin. Design/methodology/approach Daily data of bitcoin returns, returns volatility and trading volume (TV) are utilized for the period August 17, 2010-April 16, 2017. Linear and non-linear causality tests are employed to examine price-volume relationship in the bitcoin market. Findings The linear causality analysis indicates that the bitcoin TV cannot be used to predict return; however, the reverse causality is significant. In contrast, the non-linear causality analysis shows that there are non-linear feedbacks between the bitcoin TV and returns. The bitcoin TV, which represents new information, leads to price changes, and large positive price changes lead to increased trading activity. Similarly, in recent periods (post-break period), the results of the non-linear causality test show a unidirectional causality from TV to the volatility of returns.
   Originality/value The study examines bitcoin's near-stock properties in a price-volume relationship framework with the help of both linear and non-linear causality tests, which to the best of the authors' knowledge remains unexplored.

Being built on top of existing databases maintained by health providers, the architecture implements a blockchain solution to ensure the integrity of data records and improve interoperability of the systems through tracking all events that happen to the data in the databases. In this proposed architecture, we also introduce a new incentive mechanism for the creation of new blocks on the blockchain. The architecture is independent of any specific blockchain platforms and open to further extensions; hence, it potentially fits in with other electronic record systems that require protection against data misuse.

SO TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB Blockchain is receiving considerable attention among practitioners and academics. However, a detailed analysis investigating how the impact of blockchain is going to unfold is still missing. Our article sets out to assess the radicalness of blockchain at an early stage of its development and substantiates the analysis with evidence from the payments industry. We start by distilling five key aspects of radical innovation from extant literature. Our analysis of blockchain then focuses on the payments industry, which represents a major business field of banking and the cradle of this technology. The results of a Delphi study provide 17 statements about the current development of blockchain. The statements deliver insights into the impact of blockchain on the payments industry and reveal the radicalness of the technology. Based on these insights, we investigate how blockchain affects the five key aspects of radical innovation and develop contributions from an innovation management's perspective.

TI Coin.AI: A Proof-of-Useful-Work Scheme for Blockchain-Based Distributed
   Deep Learning
SO ENTROPY
AB One decade ago, Bitcoin was introduced, becoming the first cryptocurrency and establishing the concept of "blockchain" as a distributed ledger. As of today, there are many different implementations of cryptocurrencies working over a blockchain, with different approaches and philosophies. However, many of them share one common feature: they require proof-of-work to support the generation of blocks (mining) and, eventually, the generation of money. This proof-of-work scheme often consists in the resolution of a cryptography problem, most commonly breaking a hash value, which can only be achieved through brute-force. The main drawback of proof-of-work is that it requires ridiculously large amounts of energy which do not have any useful outcome beyond supporting the currency. In this paper, we present a theoretical proposal that introduces a proof-of-useful-work scheme to support a cryptocurrency running over a blockchain, which we named Coin.AI. In this system, the mining scheme requires training deep learning models, and a block is only mined when the performance of such model exceeds a threshold. The distributed system allows for nodes to verify the models delivered by miners in an easy way (certainly much more efficiently than the mining process itself), determining when a block is to be generated. Additionally, this paper presents a proof-of-storage scheme for rewarding users that provide storage for the deep learning models, as well as a theoretical dissertation on how the mechanics of the system could be articulated with the ultimate goal of democratizing access to artificial intelligence.

AB The Nudix hydrolase superfamily is identified by a conserved cassette of 23 amino acids, and it is characterized by its pyrophosphorylytic activity on a wide variety of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. Of the 13 members of the family in Escherichia coli, only one, Orf180, has not been identified with a substrate, although a host of nucleoside diphosphate compounds has been tested. Several reports have noted a strong similarity in the three-dimensional structure of the unrelated enzyme, isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IDI) to the Nudix structure, and the report that a Nudix enzyme was involved in the synthesis of geraniol, a product of the two substrates of IDI, prompted an investigation of whether the IDI substrates, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DAPP) could be substrates of Orf180. This article demonstrates that Orf180 does have a very low activity on IPP, DAPP, and geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). However, several of the other Nudix enzymes with established nucleoside diphosphate substrates hydrolyze these compounds at substantial rates. In fact, some Nudix hydrolases have higher activities on IPP, DAPP, and GPP than on their signature nucleoside diphosphate derivatives.

TI Understanding the motivations, challenges and needs of Blockchain
   software developers: a survey
SO EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
AB The blockchain technology has potential applications in various areas such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things (IoT), land registry, supply chain management, storing medical data, and identity management. Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development. On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.

TI A Distributed Energy Trading Authentication Mechanism Based on a
   Consortium Blockchain
SO ENERGIES
AB With the rapid development of the energy internet, the transaction of distributed renewable energy (DRE) is playing an increasingly important role in the energy market. However, in the transaction model of distributed renewable energy combined with public blockchain technology, nodes in the trading network can join or leave the network at any time without any permission, which hinders the regulation of electricity institutions. Corresponding to the transaction principle, a distributed renewable energy transaction authentication mechanism based on consortium blockchain is proposed in this paper. First, certificate authority nodes were set in the transaction network to provide nodes with access authority by controlling the public keys and private keys of trading participants so that they can complete their identity authentication. Next, essential chaincodes in the transaction authentication were designed and deployed on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain site, and a simulation experiment of a simple DRE transaction was used to elaborate the details on the transaction process. Finally, the proposed model was evaluated according to its performance and proved to be practical and effective.

TI Dietcoin: Hardening Bitcoin Transaction Verification Process For Mobile
   Devices
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB Distributed ledgers are among the most replicated data repositories in the world. They offer data consistency, immutability, and auditability, based on the assumption that each participating node locally verifies their entire content. Although their content, currently extending up to a few hundred gigabytes, can be accommodated by dedicated commodity hard disks, downloading it, processing it, and storing it in general-purpose desktop and laptop computers can prove largely impractical. Even worse, this becomes a prohibitive restriction for smartphones, mobile devices, and resource-constrained IoT devices.
   In this demo, we present an implementation of Dietcoin, a Bitcoin protocol extension that allows nodes to perform secure local verification of Bitcoin transactions with small bandwidth and storage requirements. This demo presents and benchmarks the main features of Dietcoin that are important for today's cryptocurrencies and smart contract systems, but are missing in the current state-of-the-art: (i) allowing resource-constrained devices to verify the correctness of selected blocks locally without having to download the complete ledger; (ii) enabling devices to join a blockchain quickly yet securely, dropping bootstrap time from days down to a matter of seconds; (iii) providing a generic solution that can be applied to other distributed ledgers secured with Proof-of-Work.

TI DATA ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM FOR E-COMMERCE PLATFORM BASED ON BLOCKCHAIN
   TECHNOLOGY
SO DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES S
AB Aiming at the poor encryption effect existing in the data encryption algorithm of e-commerce platform, and the data lost and distorted easily after encrypting, a data encryption algorithm based on blockchain technology is proposed in this paper. By analyzing the symmetric key algorithm and the public key algorithm, the DES encryption algorithm is described in detail. The two related technologies of digital envelopes and message authentication are analyzed to ensure the accuracy of the data and the one time encryption of the data. Based on this, in order to ensure the effectiveness of encryption, the process of asymmetric encryption algorithm based on chaotic sequence of neural network and asymmetric encryption algorithm based on neural network chaotic attractor are analyzed, and the security is tested. While ensuring the accuracy of data, it improves the effect of data encryption and realizes the encryption of e-commerce platform data, which is to realize data encryption algorithm based on blockchain technology. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can encrypt the data of e-commerce platform, and the encryption process is relatively simple, the encryption effect is better, and the accuracy of the encrypted data is relatively high, which provides a theoretical basis for further research of the subject.

TI Strategic Prosumers: How to Set the Prices in a Tiered Market?
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB We consider users who may have renewable energy harvesting devices or distributed generators. Such users can behave as consumers or producers (hence, we denote them as prosumers) at different time instances. We consider a tieredmarket where the grid selects a price function, which reveals price in the real time based on the total demand to the grid. In the real time, a prosumer can buy from another prosumer in an exchange market knowing the price from the grid. The exchange price is set by a platform and can be different for different sellers. A prosumer is a selfish entity, which selects the amount of energy it wants to buy either from the grid or from other prosumers or the amount of excess energy it wants to sell to other prosumers by maximizing its own payoff. However, the strategy and the payoff of a prosumer inherently depend on the strategy of other prosumers as a prosumer can only buy if the other prosumers are willing to sell. We formulate the problem as a coupled constrained game and seek to obtain the generalized Nash equilibrium. We show that the game is a concave potential game and show that there exists a unique generalized Nash equilibrium. We propose a distributed algorithm that converges to the exchange price, which clears the market and achieves the generalized Nash equilibrium. We, finally, show how the grid should select the price function in a day-ahead scenario by computing the estimated demand from the history. Our numerical result shows that the tiered market can reduce the peak load and increase the prosumers' total payoffs.

TI Graph structure and statistical properties of Ethereum transaction
   relationships
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In recent years, the rapid development of blockchain technologies has attracted considerable attention. However, little effort has been devoted toward investigating the large amount of trade data recorded in blockchains. This paper focuses on transaction data in Ethereum, which is a prominent public blockchain platform supporting not only secure cryptocurrency transfer but also various decentralized applications. By means of the frame- work of network science theory, we find that several transaction features, such as transac-tion volume, transaction relation, and component structure, exhibit a heavy-tailed property and can be approximated by the power law function. In particular, we find that the trans- action relations follow a bow-tie structure with negative assortativity if they are regarded as a directed graph. The popular hubs tend to connect to a large number of common users. We believe that the aforementioned statistics can be ascribed to the vast diversity of trans- actions and the existence of a number of cryptocurrency exchanges. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to not only carry out a relatively comprehensive inves-tigation of the transaction data recorded in Ethereum but also probe the statistical laws underlying the transaction relationships from the perspective of network science.

TI A Collaborative Intrusion Detection Approach Using Blockchain for
   Multimicrogrid Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS
AB Multimicrogrid (MMG) systems have the potential to play an increasingly important role in the transformation of existing power grid to smart grid. However, the open and distributed connectivity of MMGs exposes the systems into various cyber-attacks, which may cause serious failures or physical damages, such as power supply interruption and human casualties. Therefore, ensuring the security of MMGs is of paramount importance. To address this issue, a new collaborative intrusion detection (CID) approach using blockchain is proposed in this paper for MMG systems in smart grid. Due to the consensus mechanism of blockchain, the approach is designed without the need of a trusted authority or central server while improving the accuracy of intrusion detection in a collaborative way. It is equipped with a proposal generation method that combines periodic and trigger patterns to generate the detection target of CID, i.e., a proposal. From the generated proposals together with the correlation model of MMGs, a CID is achieved by using the consensus mechanism. The final detection results of CID are stored on blockchain in sequence. The use of an incentive mechanism motivates a single microgrid to participate in consensus. The effectiveness of the presented approach is demonstrated through a case study on an MMG system.

TI CertLedger: A new PKI model with Certificate Transparency based on
   blockchain
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB In conventional PKI, CAs are assumed to be fully trusted. However, in practice, CAs' absolute responsibility for providing trustworthiness caused major security and privacy issues. To prevent such issues, Google introduced the concept of Certificate Transparency (CT) in 2013. Later, several new PKI models are proposed to reduce the level of trust to the CAs. However, all of these proposals are still vulnerable to split-world attacks if the adversary is capable of showing different views of the log to the targeted victims. In this paper, we propose a new PKI architecture with certificate transparency based on blockchain, what we called CertLedger, to eliminate the split-world attacks and to provide certificate/revocation transparency. All TLS certificates' validation, storage, and entire revocation process is conducted in CertLedger as well as Trusted CA certificate management. During a TLS connection, TLS clients get an efficient proof of existence of the certificate directly from its domain owners. Hence, privacy is now perfectly preserved by eliminating the traceability issue via OCSP servers. It also provides a unique, efficient, and trustworthy certificate validation process eliminating the conventional inadequate and incompatible certificate validation processes implemented by different software vendors. TLS clients in CertLedger also do not require to make certificate validation and store the trusted CA certificates anymore. We analyze the security and performance of CertLedger and provide a comparison with the previous proposals. Finally, we implement its protoype on Ethereum to demonstrate experimental results. The results show that the performance of the TLS handshake and certificate validation through CertLedger is significantly improved compared to the current TLS protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

With this method, solution with precise probability in minimal time is realized. We have used the expectation maximization algorithm and polynomial matrix factorization. The advantages of this statistical method are the less iteration to converge to the consensus solution and easiness to configure the complete mathematical model as per the requirement. Moreover, the energy and memory consumption are also less which make this approach appealing for cloud and fog computing. The experimental results also show that the proposed approach is significantly efficient in terms of time and memory consumption. This novel approach seems beneficial for Internetof- Things (IoT), one of the most fast-growing technologies in network computing.

TI Company Law, Connecting Factors and the Digital Age - A New Outlook
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
AB Usually connecting factors in company law play a decisive role with regard to the corporate governance model of a company and with regard to the level of protection of stakeholders. Their importance generated along-lasting debate on which connecting factor is "better"and which one is compatible with internal market rules. However, technological developments and digitalisation shed a different light on this discussion.
   In order to understand how the current developments impact the discussion on company law connecting factors, it should first be clear what is really understood by connecting factors in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. It is important to understand the relationship between substantive company law rules and those on conflict of laws.
   The outcome of the above analysis allows to add the digitalisation/new technologies factor into the equation. In this context, a closer look is given at the use of artificial intelligence applications in company law and the operation of a decentralised autonomous organisation within a blockchain network. It allows to question the effectiveness and usefulness of traditional connecting factors.

TI IoTPatchPool: Incentivized delivery network of IoT software updates
   based on proofs-of-distribution
SO PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING
AB In this paper we introduce IoTPatchPool - a novel scheme that enables an incentivized distributed delivery network of IoT software updates. We use a decentralized storage network for reducing the load on the vendor when distributing patches toward IoT devices, and eliminating central points of failure. Unlike existing peer-to-peer file sharing networks which have a fundamental availability problem for unpopular files, our protocol utilizes blockchain-based smart contracts to incentivize independent peers, termed distributors, by means of cryptocurrency payments. A vendor of IoT devices deploys a smart contract with a deposit, which acts as a publicly verifiable binding bid for delivery of patches to a specific set of IoT endpoints. Distributors will compete for delivering the updates to the desired IoT devices and present proofs-of-distribution in exchange for cryptocurrency payments. We address the fair exchange problem between distributors and the consuming IoT devices by utilizing a variation of the Zero-Knowledge Contingent Payments (ZKCP) protocol, ensuring that the process is trustless. This can encourage the participation of a large number of distributors, and thus facilitate a rapid scale-out of the system. Finally, we present and evaluate a prototype implementation combining the BitTorrent network with the cryptocurrency Ethereum. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Multi-level multi-secret sharing scheme for decentralized e-voting in
   cloud computing
SO JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB The cryptosystem-based data privacy preserving methods employ high computing power of cloud servers, where the main feature is to allow resource sharing and provide multi-user independent services. Therefore, to achieve the rapid allocation and release of resource sharing in cloud computing, decentralized cryptographic protocols need to be proposed for multi-user consensus systems. In this work, we first present a multi-secret sharing scheme with multi-level access structure, where the secret reconstruction algorithm satisfies the additive homomorphism. The secret sharing scheme needs no trusted third parties and any user can play the role of dealer. In the designing, multiple target secrets are independently shared, where each subset of users forms a sub-access structure and shares one target secret only with a short secret share. This scheme is efficient and unconditionally secure.
   Furthermore, based on the multi-level access structures, a decentralized multi-role e-voting protocol is designed using Chinese Remainder Theorem, where each role's election is associated with one sub-access structure. The voters employ a shared parameter to blind the sum of ballot values. Meanwhile, the e-voting scheme supports a public verification for the final election results. Compared with the existing e-voting protocols, our e-voting system does not require any authority center and the cloud server runs vote counting. And our e-voting scheme does not need any high-complexity computational cost operation such as module exponential operation, etc. Finally, the common feature of Blockchain and Ad Hoc networks is decentralized. Thus the main idea of this protocol without a trusted third party can be used to achieve a secure consensus among multiple nodes in Blockchain and Ad Hoc network, meanwhile, the consensus results can be verified.

AB In order to solve the problem that users can not request to exit during the bitcoin confusion process, an anonymous revocation scheme for Bitcoin confusion is proposed. The commitment is used to bind the user with its destination address. When the user requests to quit the shuffle service, a zero-knowledge proof of the commitment is made using the accumulator and the signatures of knowledge. Finally, the shuffled output address of the user who quits the service is modified to its destination address. Security analysis shows that the scheme satisfies the anonymity of the user who quits the service based on the double discrete logarithm problem and the strong RSA assumption, and can be implemented without modifying the current bitcoin system. The scheme allows at most n-2 users to exit in the confusion process of n (n >= 10) honest users participation.

TI Chained Compressed Sensing: A Blockchain-Inspired Approach for Low-Cost
   Security in IoT Sensing
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Chaining, i.e., the mode of operation in which each message is encrypted considering a digital summary of previous ones, is here applied to block-cipher stages based on compressed sensing. We show that this simple and parsimonious technique may significantly harden the resulting system with respect to common threats such that ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Non-negligible robustness comes at the price of not more than a 2% of energy overhead with respect to the pure compression stage which represents a 24 x reduction with respect to straightforward implementation of a traditional cryptography primitive like Advanced Encryption Standard.

TI IoT and Blockchain Paradigms for EV Charging System
SO ENERGIES
AB In this research work, we apply the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm with a decentralized blockchain approach to handle the electric vehicle (EV) charging process in shared spaces, such as condominiums. A mobile app handles the user authentication mechanism to initiate the EV charging process, where a set of sensors are used for measuring energy consumption, and based on a microcontroller, establish data communication with the mobile app. A blockchain handles financial transitions, and this approach can be replicated to other EV charging scenarios, such as public charging systems in a city, where the mobile device provides an authentication mechanism. A user interface was developed to visualize transactions, gather users' preferences, and handle power charging limitations due to the usage of a shared infrastructure. The developed approach was tested in a shared space with three EVs using a charging infrastructure for a period of 3.5 months.

TI Crowdsourced Traffic Event Detection and Source Reputation Assessment
   Using Smart Contracts
SO SENSORS
AB Real-time data about various traffic events and conditions-offences, accidents, dangerous driving, or dangerous road conditions-is crucial for safe and efficient transportation. Unlike roadside infrastructure data which are often limited in scope and quantity, crowdsensing approaches promise much broader and comprehensive coverage of traffic events. However, to ensure safe and efficient traffic operation, assessing trustworthiness of crowdsourced data is of crucial importance; this also includes detection of intentional or unintentional manipulation, deception, and spamming. In this paper, we design and demonstrate a road traffic event detection and source reputation assessment system for unreliable data sources. Special care is taken to adapt the system for operation in decentralized mode, using smart contracts on a Turing-complete blockchain platform, eliminating single authority over such systems and increasing resilience to institutional data manipulation. The proposed solution was evaluated using both a synthetic traffic event dataset and a dataset gathered from real users, using a traffic event reporting mobile application in a professional driving simulator used for driver training. The results show the proposed system can accurately detect a range of manipulative and misreporting behaviors, and quickly converges to the final trust score even in a resource-constrained environment of a blockchain platform virtual machine.

TI A survey on zero knowledge range proofs and applications
SO SN APPLIED SCIENCES
AB In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology-EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology-ASIACRYPT 2008, Springer, Berlin, 2008), and bulletproofs (Bunz et al., in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP), 2018), proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (Bunz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP, in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced (Morais et al., in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation, 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).

TI Blockchain-Based Secure Storage Management with Edge Computing for IoT
SO ELECTRONICS
AB As a core technology to manage decentralized systems, blockchain is gaining much popularity to deploy such applications as smart grid and healthcare systems. However, its utilization in resource-constrained mobile devices is limited due to high demands of resources and poor scalability with frequent-intensive transactions. Edge computing can be integrated to facilitate mobile devices in offloading their mining tasks to cloud resources. This integration ensures reliable access, distributed computation and untampered storage for scalable and secure transactions. It is imperative therefore that crucial issues of security, scalability and resources management be addressed to achieve successful integration. Studies have been conducted to explore suitable architectural requirements, and some researchers have applied the integration to deploy some specific applications. Despite these efforts, however, issues of anonymity, adaptability and integrity still need to be investigated further to attain a practical, secure decentralized data storage. We based our study on peer-to-peer and blockchain to achieve an Internet of Things (IoT) design supported by edge computing to acquire security and scalability levels needed for the integration. We investigated existing blockchain and associated technologies to discover solutions that address anonymity, integrity and adaptability issues for successful integration of blockchain in IoT systems. The discovered solutions were then incorporated in our conceptual design of the decentralized application prototype presented for secure storage of IoT data and transactions.

TI A Systematic Analysis of Real-World Energy Blockchain Initiatives
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB The application of blockchain technology to the energy sector promises to derive new operating models focused on local generation and sustainable practices, which are driven by peer-to-peer collaboration and community engagement. However, real-world energy blockchains differ from typical blockchain networks insofar as they must interoperate with grid infrastructure, adhere to energy regulations, and embody engineering principles. Naturally, these additional dimensions make real-world energy blockchains highly dependent on the participation of grid operators, engineers, and energy providers. Although much theoretical and proof-of-concept research has been published on energy blockchains, this research aims to establish a lens on real-world projects and implementations that may inform the alignment of academic and industry research agendas. This research classifies 131 real-world energy blockchain initiatives to develop an understanding of how blockchains are being applied to the energy domain, what type of failure rates can be observed from recently reported initiatives, and what level of technical and theoretical details are reported for real-world deployments. The results presented from the systematic analysis highlight that real-world energy blockchains are (a) growing exponentially year-on-year, (b) producing relatively low failure/drop-off rates (similar to 7% since 2015), and (c) demonstrating information sharing protocols that produce content with insufficient technical and theoretical depth.

TI Double-spending prevention for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Zero-confirmation transactions, i.e. transactions that have been broadcast but are still pending to be included in the blockchain, have gained attention in order to enable fast payments in Bitcoin, shortening the time for performing payments. Fast payments are desirable in certain scenarios, for instance, when buying in vending machines, fast food restaurants, or withdrawing from an ATM. Despite being quickly propagated through the network, zero-confirmation transactions are not protected against double-spending attacks, since the double-spending protection Bitcoin offers relies on the blockchain and, by definition, such transactions are not yet included in it. In this paper, we propose a double-spending prevention mechanism for Bitcoin zero-confirmation transactions. Our proposal is based on exploiting the flexibility of the Bitcoin scripting language together with a well-known vulnerability of the ECDSA signature scheme to discourage attackers from performing such an attack.

Smart manufacturing systems (SMSs) have become the focus of attention of some countries and manufacturing enterprises. At present, there are some applications of SMSs in different industrial fields. However, there is still a lack of a unified definition of SMSs and a unified analysis of requirements. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of SMSs, this paper summarized the evolution, definition, objectives, functional requirements, business requirements, technical requirements, and components of SMSs. At the same time, it points out the current development status and level. Based on above, an autonomous SMSs model driven by dynamic demand and key performance indicators is proposed. Through the review of this paper, the reference can be provided for the transformation of more manufacturing enterprises from the traditional to the intellectualized ones.

AB The consumption of food and its safety are important for human security. In this paper, we reviewed the literature on future possibilities for transforming the food system through digital solutions in the Barents region. Such digital solutions will make food business operators more efficient, sustainable, and transparent. Developing cross-border infrastructures for digitalization in the region will break the isolation of the local food system, thus simplifying the availability of processed, novel and safe traditional food products. It is necessary for food growers and processors to respond to the trends driven by consumers' demand while ensuring their safety. Our review highlights the opportunities provided by digital technology to ensure safety and help food business operators predict consumer trends in the future. In addition, digitalization can create conditions that are necessary for the diversification of organizational schemes and the effective monitoring of food processing operations that will help to promote food and nutrition security in the Barents region.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB With the continuous development of Internet of things, all kinds of smart systems are quickly evolving to make our day-to-day life smoother and safer. Like many other sectors, transportation has entered a period of rapid change. Intelligent Traffic System is one of the fastest-growing fields within the smart systems, which is expected to increase road safety, mitigate traffic congestion, and enable fuel efficiency. The main functionalities of Intelligent Traffic System are as follows: (1) monitoring real-time traffic conditions in specific areas, (2) locating traffic emergencies (i.e. traffic accidents) in specific areas, and (3) dynamic monitoring and managing the continuous use in public transit services (i.e. change in car lanes) that may lead to changes in macro traffic conditions. This article will use the above-mentioned functionalities of the Intelligent Traffic System as underlying simulative scenarios, to design and to implement a smart transportation system based on Internet of things and blockchain-both share inherent distributed technology characteristics-combining both Internet of things sensor nodes and distributed ledger technology, to (1) record the changes in intelligent transportation systems and (2) set up a credit-token mechanism for paying the use and misuses in public transit services accordingly. The Intelligent Traffic System described in this article is intended to be used as experimental project only, given the terms and conditions as depicted in the simulated scenario. In real-life traffic scenarios, it may generate more complex system and data security issues, which will be elaborated and analyzed at the end of this article. Intelligent Traffic System is a comprehensive smart system; it can significantly change and reinvent the wheel for traffic conditions. Based on the system development as discussed in this article, there are still a lot of demands and challenges that need to be addressed in the future. Such topic scope will be explored in depth in our subsequent research.

TI A blockchain-based decentralized efficient investigation framework for
   IoT digital forensics
SO JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING
AB Until now, there has been little research on digital forensics in the IoT (Internet of Things)-based infrastructure. Current digital forensic tools, investigation frameworks, and processes cannot meet the heterogeneity and distribution characteristics of the IoT environment. These characteristics are a challenge for digital forensic investigators and law enforcement agencies. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a digital forensics framework for the IoT environment based on the blockchain technology. In the proposed framework, all communications of IoT devices are stored in the blockchain as transactions, thus making the existing chain of custody process easier and more powerful. By using the blockchain technology, the integrity of the data to be analyzed is ensured and security is strengthened, and the preservation of integrity is made more reliable by a decentralized method of integrity preservation. In addition, since the public distributed ledger is provided, participants in the forensic investigation-such as device users, manufacturers, investigators, and service providers-can confirm the investigation process transparently. We simulated the proposed model to support the proof of concept.

Recently we designed various protocols to regulate the injection rate of unverified transactions into the system to improve system performance. Each of the protocols is designed to address issues related to some particular network traffic syndrome. In this work, we first provide the review of our prior protocols. We then provide a hybrid scheme that combines our transaction injection protocols and provides an optimal linear combination of the protocols based on the syndromes in the network. The goal is to speed up the verification process of systems that rely on only one single basic protocol. The underlying basic protocols are Periodic Injection of Transaction via Evaluation Corridor (PITEC), Probabilistic Injection of Transactions (PIT), and Adaptive Semi-synchronous Transaction Injection (ASTI).

AB An exemplary paradigm of how an AI can be a disruptive technological paragon via the utilization of blockchain comes straight from the world of deep learning. Data scientists have long struggled to maintain the quality of a dataset for machine learning by an AI entity. Datasets can be very expensive to purchase, as, depending on both the proper selection of the elements and the homogeneity of the data contained within, constructing and maintaining the integrity of a dataset is difficult. Blockchain as a highly secure storage medium presents a technological quantum leap in maintaining data integrity. Furthermore, blockchain's immutability constructs a fruitful environment for creating high quality, permanent and growing datasets for deep learning. The combination of AI and blockchain could impact fields like Internet of things (IoT), identity, financial markets, civil governance, smart cities, small communities, supply chains, personalized medicine and other fields, and thereby deliver benefits to many people.

TI Blockchain-based trusted data sharing among trusted stakeholders in IoT
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Sharing trusted data among trusted stakeholders is very important to large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the entities and organizations involved in IoT naturally lack trusted relationships, which poses significant challenges to the above vision. Specifically, the first challenge is to ensure that the data in the physical world can be objectively and truly injected into the information world of IoT. The second is to ensure the credibility of the entities' identities in IoT. The third is to ensure the authenticity of data, the credibility of identity, and the reliable transmission of data when a third trusted party is unable to provide the expected trusted services. In view of the above challenges, this paper proposes a secure and lightweight triple-trusting architecture (SLTA), which fully uses a blockchain-related supporting technology. The architecture includes an oracle-based data collection mechanism, which ensures that the data collected from edge devices of IoT cannot be modified, and the distributed identity management mechanism, which enhances personal privacy, security, and control of digital identities. Furthermore, a series of innovative designs for applying the blockchain to special large-scale cooperation scenario in IoT are proposed, which is also a part of the key mechanisms of the SLTA. The innovative design includes a new software-defined blockchain structure model and a lightweight Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm that provides credible support for decentralized data collection, identity management, and data transfer, as well as low-overhead sequential storage mechanism.

TI Cluster analysis on the structure of the cryptocurrency market via
   Bitcoin-Ethereum filtering
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The purpose of this research is to analyze the structure of the cryptocurrency market based on the correlation-based agglomerative hierarchical clustering and minimum spanning tree. In order to detect a reasonable and distinct collective behavior among the market entities, we propose a filtering mechanism, called Bitcoin-Ethereum filtering to exclude their linear influences to other cryptocurrencies. In this regard, we carefully examine the market structures for the cases of before and after filtering in terms of the Total, Pre-, and Post-regulation periods. Based on the results, we discover the leadership of the Bitcoin and Ethereum in the market, six homogeneous clusters composed of relatively less-traded cryptocurrencies, and transformation of the market structure after the announcement of regulations from various countries.

TI Blockchain as a game changer in energy industry? Results of an
   Austria-wide survey of decision-makers from the energy industry on the
   opportunities and risks of blockchain
SO ELEKTROTECHNIK UND INFORMATIONSTECHNIK
AB The blockchain technology is currently a big issue and has also reached the energy industry. It enables transactions that are documented permanently and for everyone in a comprehensible manner, and thus take place without a trustworthy intermediary. Blockchain technology also opens up new possibilities for the energy industry, such as for financing, certification and trading of (renewable) energy. By testing blockchain technology in concrete use cases of the energy sector, the project SonnWende+ deals with the technological possibilities, legal framework conditions and the needs of and the acceptance by stakeholders and users. As part of the co-creation process, a survey among energy decision makers was conducted on the gamechanging potentials they expect through blockchain technology. The survey shows that the energy industry is already actively engaged in the topic of blockchain and that the advantages of this new technology are well appreciated. Special opportunities are seen in the charge management for e-mobility, new forms of energy trading and grid management. About one fifth of the decision-makers surveyed believe in blockchain as a game changer for the energy industry. Accordingly, a high potential for disruption is also expected for some players in the energy industry. However, the survey also reveals a certain amount of skepticism and uncertainty regarding the new technology. The hurdles and dangers mentioned by the decision-makers underline the need for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary projects that implement, analyze and promote the sensible use of blockchain technology in the energy industry in an application-oriented manner. This built-up know-how will enable the Austrian energy industry to actively shape the framework conditions for the use of blockchain technology in the future.

TI New Blockchain-Based Architecture for Service Interoperations in
   Internet of Things
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) is able to integrate the computation and physical processes as services in the social world. The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the examples of smart contract implementations.

AB For the Pacific world, 1865 brought together Spain and Micronesia. A scattering of tiny islands to the southeast of the Philippines and northwest of Australia, this country was part of a larger territory whose global reputation featured resistance: to Catholicism, commercial exploitation and being pushed around in general. Self-sufficient and socially complex in fascinating ways for thousands of years, Micronesia has been reduced to the secondary role of coconut traders by world history of the fifteenth through twentieth centuries.

TI Idea of Using Blockchain Technique for Choosing the Best Configuration
   of Weights in Neural Networks
SO ALGORITHMS
AB The blockchain technique is becoming more and more popular due to its advantages such as stability and dispersed nature. This is an idea based on blockchain activity paradigms. Another important field is machine learning, which is increasingly used in practice. Unfortunately, the training or overtraining artificial neural networks is very time-consuming and requires high computing power. In this paper, we proposed using a blockchain technique to train neural networks. This type of activity is important due to the possible search for initial weights in the network, which affect faster training, due to gradient decrease. We performed the tests with much heavier calculations to indicate that such an action is possible. However, this type of solution can also be used for less demanding calculations, i.e., only a few iterations of training and finding a better configuration of initial weights.

TI A blockchain-based framework to secure vehicular social networks
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
AB Vehicular social network is emerging as a new promising concept, combining two types of network paradigms, namely, vehicular networks and social networks. In order to manage efficiently the security and the control of the network, this paper proposes a new framework based on the emerging concepts of software-defined vehicular network (SDVN) and blockchain. Using the SDVN makes the network more programmable, virtualized, and partitionable. However, on the other hand, it also creates a well-known vulnerability of a single point of failure. Hence, we propose to introduce the blockchain paradigm that will enable the certification of transactions and ensure data anonymity in a fully distributed manner. To this end, three levels of controllers are needed: a principal controller (PC), roadside units (RSUs), and a local controller. In order to dynamically select miners, a distributed miners connected dominating set algorithm (DM-CDS) has been proposed. The DM-CDS is a single-phase distributed algorithm that supports a dynamic topology based on a trust model and some other network parameters, such as the connectivity degree, the average link quality indicator, and the rank. The performance of the proposed DM-CDS is evaluated throughout multiple scenarios using different parameters, such as trust metric, node density, node mobility, and radio range. The obtained results highlight the importance of such proposed architecture, especially in terms of number of required miners. For instance, when the density of nodes increases, the number of selected miners increases similarly to when the network length increases. The node mobility impacts also on the stability of the selected miners, in terms of withdrawing and joining, showing a variation between 0% and 10%. The trust metric has also an important impact on the selection of miners, as only nodes with a higher trust level are selected to endorse the roles of miners.

TI Decentralized blacklistable anonymous credentials with reputation
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Blacklistable anonymous credential systems provide service providers with a way to authenticate users according to their historical behaviors, while guaranteeing that all users can access services in an anonymous and unlinkable manner, thus are potentially useful in practice. Traditionally, to protect services from illegal access, the credential issuer, which completes the registration with users, must be trusted by the service provider. However, in practice, this trust assumption is usually unsatisfied.
   In this paper, we solve this problem and present the decentralized blacklistable anonymous credential system with reputation (DBLACR), which inherits nearly all features of the BLACR system presented in Au et al. (2012) but does not need a trusted party to register users.The new system also has extra advantages. In particular, it enables blacklist (historical behaviors) sharing among different service providers and is partially resilient to the blacklist gaming attack, where dishonest service providers attempt to compromise the privacy of users via generating blacklist maliciously.
   Technically, the main approach to achieve DBLACR system is a novel use of the blockchain technique, which serves as a public append-only ledger. The system can be instantiated from three different types of cryptographic systems, including the RSA system, the classical DL system, and the pairing based system. To demonstrate the practicability of our system, we also give a proof of concept implementation for the instantiation under the RSA system. The experiment results indicate that when authenticating with blacklists of reasonable size, our implementation can fulfill practical efficiency demands. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Portable Smart Spectrometer Integrated with Blockchain and Big Data
   Technology
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A portable smart spectrometer (PSS-1.0) and related systems have been designed and implemented to provide rapid on-site spectral analysis and lower the operator knowledge threshold for the application of spectrometry. The PSS-1.0 employs spectral analysis models downloaded from the spectral analysis system for offline spectral analysis and displays the results in the field. Users are incentivized to upload spectral analysis data to the Internet for storage by big data technologies, so that the spectral data can be reused easily. By employing blockchain technology it can be ensured that the data has not been tampered with, which can be used in monitoring and data transaction scenarios. The design of this spectrometer and related systems can be used for regulatory uses that require spectroscopy. Experimental results are presented in this paper, which prove that the design of the PSS-1.0 is feasible. The purpose of this paper is to design a civilian and non-operator knowledge threshold spectrometer and provide some ideas for better processing and utilization of spectral data.

The partial decentralized consortium blockchain with limited pre-set nodes can well improve transparency and security, which is suitable for financial regulation. Considering irregularities of the P2P lending market, the Hyperledger-based Peer-to-Peer Lending System (HyperP2PLS) is proposed. First elaborate the application scenario and business logic of the system, where a national P2P Lending Trading Center will be established to integrate all transactions and information of P2P lending market. Then construct the system architecture consisting of the blockchain network, HTTP server, and applications. The algorithm of implementation process and the web application for users have been well illustrated. The performance analysis shows that HyperP2PLS can guarantee the reliability, safety, transparency and efficiency.

TI Blockchain-based decentralized and secure keyless signature scheme for
   smart grid
SO ENERGY
AB Due to the urgent requirement to achieve secure communication between service providers (SPs) and smart meters (SMs), including reliable mutual authentication and privacy credentials, key management is critical in smart grids. Recently, a number of key management schemes have been proposed. However, schemes based on trusted third parties (TTPs) become insecure if the TTP fails. Furthermore, the SPs in most schemes are centralized to manage their respective SMs, which involve a single point of failure. Furthermore, SPs cannot monitor each other for data traceability or security auditing. To remedy these inadequacies, we propose a decentralized keyless signature scheme based on a consortium blockchain to realize more efficient and secure key management. The SM sends requests and receive responses using a blockchain network for data transmission operations. We designed a decentralized secure consensus mechanism that turns a blockchain into an automated access-control manager that does not require a TTP or trust anchor. The SPs of the proposed scheme can keep each other in check using the blockchain. In our concluding remarks, we describe how the proposed scheme incurs smaller computational time costs and is both cost-effective and scalable. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FINANCE
AB This paper examines the impact of South Korea's ban on Bitcoin futures on intraday spot volatility, liquidity and volatility-volume relationship. The results show that while reducing the permanent component of intraday spot volatility, the imposition of a ban on Bitcoin futures trading increases the transitory component. For intraday spot liquidity, different liquidity proxies indicate heterogeneous results. Moreover, we identify a positive and unidirectional effect of intraday spot volume on volatility. This effect appears to be stronger in the post-ban period. Overall, over the past few months, South Korea's Bitcoin futures ban generally has had a significant impact on the intraday dynamics of the Bitcoin spot market.

TI Towards a trusted unmanned aerial system using blockchain for the
   protection of critical infrastructure
SO TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
AB With the exponential growth in the number of vital infrastructures such as nuclear plants and transport and distribution networks, these systems have become more susceptible to coordinated cyberattacks. One of the effective approaches used to strengthen the security of these infrastructures is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance and data collection. However, UAVs themselves are prone to attacks on their collected sensor data. Recently, blockchain (BC) has been proposed as a revolutionary technology that can be integrated within Internet of things (IoT) to provide a desired level of security and privacy. However, the integration of BC within IoT networks, where UAV's sensors constitute a major component, is extremely challenging. The major contribution of this study is twofold:(1) survey the security issues for UAV's collected sensor data, define the security requirements for such systems, and identify ways to address them; and (2) propose a novel BC-based solution to ensure the security of and the trust between the UAVs and their relevant ground control stations. Our implementation results and analysis show that using UAVs as means for protecting critical infrastructure is greatly enhanced through the utilization of trusted BC-based unmanned aerial systems.

Average (median) ICO underpricing amounts to 15% (3%), even though 4 out of 10 ICOs destroy value on the first trading day. Liquidity, market capitalization, and high-low price ratios predict returns. Long-run buy-and-hold returns are positive for the mean and negative for the median. For holding periods between one and twenty-four months, the median ICO depreciates by 30%. Evidently, there is substantial positive skewness in the cryptocurrency market. Further, a size effect emerges from the data as an empirical regularity: Large ICOs are more often overpriced and underperform in the long run.

We aim to investigate return connectedness across eight of the major exchanges of Bitcoin, both from a static and a dynamic viewpoint. To this end, we employ an extension of the order-invariant forecast error variance decomposition proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to a generalized vector error correction framework. Our results suggest that there is strong connectedness among the exchanges, as expected, although some of them behave dissimilarly. We identify Bitfinex and Coinbase as leading exchanges during the considered period, while Kraken as a follower exchange. We also obtain that connectedness across exchanges is strongly dynamic, as it evolves over time.

   The 2017 Sci-Hub judgement has, to date, proven unenforceable, and it appears that enforcing the 2019 OMICS judgement will similarly prove challenging. Business developments and changing expectations over sharing digital content may also undermine the impact of the ongoing cases against ResearchGate and Georgia State University. Stakeholders should consider these limitations when deciding how to resolve scholarly publishing disputes.

TI Cloud Health Resource Sharing Based on Consensus-Oriented Blockchain
   Technology: Case Study on a Breast Tumor Diagnosis Service
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: In recent years, researchers have made significant efforts in advancing blockchain technology. This technology, with distinct features of decentralization and security, can be applied to many fields. In areas of health data and resource sharing, applications of blockchain technology are also emerging.
   Objective: In this study, we propose a cloud health resource-sharing model based on consensus-oriented blockchain technology and have developed a simulation study on breast tumor diagnosis.
   Methods: The proposed platform is built on a consortium or federated blockchain that possesses features of both centralization and decentralization. The consensus mechanisms generate operating standards for the proposed model. Open source Ethereum code is employed to provide the blockchain environment. Proof of Authority is selected as the consensus algorithm of block generation.
   Results: Based on the proposed model, a simulation case study for breast tumor classification is constructed. The simulation includes 9893 service requests from 100 users; 22 service providers are equipped with 22 different classification methods. Each request is fulfilled by a service provider recommended by the weighted k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The majority of service requests are handled by 9 providers, and provider service evaluation scores tend to stabilize. Also, user priority on KNN weights significantly affects the system operation outcome.
   Conclusions: The proposed model is feasible based on the simulation case study for the cloud service of breast tumor diagnosis and has the potential to be applied to other applications.

TI Algorand: A secure and efficient distributed ledger
SO THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB A distributed ledger is a tamperproof sequence of data that can be publicly accessed and augmented by everyone, without being maintained by a centralized party. Distributed ledgers stand to revolutionize the way a modern society operates. They can secure all kinds of traditional transactions, such as payments, asset transfers and titles, in the exact order in which the transactions occur; and enable totally new transactions, such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They can remove intermediaries and usher in a new paradigm for trust. As currently implemented, however, distributed ledgers scale poorly and cannot achieve their enormous potential.
   In this paper we propose Algorand, an alternative, secure and efficient distributed ledger. Algorand is permissionless and works in a highly asynchronous environment. Unlike prior implementations of distributed ledgers based on "proof of work," Algorand dispenses with "miners" and requires only a negligible amount of computation. Moreover, its transaction history "forks" only with negligible probability: that is, Algorand guarantees the finality of a transaction the moment the transaction enters the ledger.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Ethereum was the first decentralised platform to support smart contracts. It has attracted significant publicity and captured the interests of a wide range of institutions, enthusiasts and even world leaders. We have analysed the market price index for all exchanges trading in Ethereum versus three global currencies, the Korean Won; Euro; US Dollar; Bitcoin, and the Global Price Index for Ethereum, through the fitting of the Generalised Hyperbolic distributions and its subclasses. Our results show that returns are clearly non-normal and the Generalised Hyperbolic and its subset of distributions fit well jointly for all of the indices. We also analyse the long term memory effect for the returns of Ether, compare the Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall based on historical Ether data and other financial instruments, and backtesting was also performed to test the extreme tails.

TI A Blockchain Framework for Securing Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
SO SENSORS
AB Recently, connected vehicles (CV) are becoming a promising research area leading to the concept of CV as a Service (CVaaS). With the increase of connected vehicles and an exponential growth in the field of online cab booking services, new requirements such as secure, seamless and robust information exchange among vehicles of vehicular networks are emerging. In this context, the original concept of vehicular networks is being transformed into a new concept known as connected and autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicular use yields a better experience and helps in reducing congestion by allowing current information to be obtained by the vehicles instantly. However, malicious users in the internet of vehicles may mislead the whole communication where intruders may compromise smart devices with the purpose of executing a malicious ploy. In order to prevent these issues, a blockchain technique is considered the best technique that provides secrecy and protection to the control system in real time conditions. In this paper, the issue of security in smart sensors of connected vehicles that can be compromised by expert intruders is addressed by proposing a blockchain framework. This study has further identified and validated the proposed mechanism based on various security criteria, such as fake requests of the user, compromise of smart devices, probabilistic authentication scenarios and alteration in stored user's ratings. The results have been analyzed against some existing approach and validated with improved simulated results that offer 79% success rate over the above-mentioned issues.

TI Y-DWMS: A Digital Watermark Management System Based on Smart Contracts
SO SENSORS
AB With the development of information technology, films, music, and other publications are inclined to be distributed in digitalized form. However, the low cost of data replication and dissemination leads to digital rights problems and brings huge economic losses. Up to now, existing digital rights management (DRM) schemes have been powerless to deter attempts of infringing digital rights and recover losses of copyright holders. This paper presents a YODA-based digital watermark management system (Y-DWMS), adopting non-repudiation of smart contract and blockchain, to implement a DRM mechanism to infinitely amplify the cost of infringement and recover losses copyright holders suffered once the infringement is reported. We adopt game analysis to prove that in Y-DWMS, the decision of non-infringement always dominates rational users, so as to fundamentally eradicate the infringement of digital rights, which current mainstream DRM schemes cannot reach.

TI Some comments on Bitcoin market (in)efficiency
SO PLOS ONE
AB In this paper, we explore the (in)efficiency of the continuum Bitcoin-USD market in the period ranging from mid 2010 to early 2019. To deal with, we dynamically analyse the evolution of the self-similarity exponent of Bitcoin-USD daily returns via accurate FD4 approach by a 512 day sliding window with overlapping data. Further, we define the memory indicator by the difference between the self-similarity exponent of Bitcoin-USD series and the self similarity index of its shuffled series. We also carry out additional analyses via FD4 approach by sliding windows of sizes equal to 64, 128, 256, and 1024 days, and also via FD algorithm for values of q equal to 1 and 2 (and sliding windows equal to 512 days). Moreover, we explored the evolution of the self-similarity exponent of actual S&P500 series via FD4 algorithm by sliding windows of sizes equal to 256 and 512 days. In all the cases, the obtained results were found to be similar to our first analysis. We conclude that the self-similarity exponent of the BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series stands above 0.5. However, this is not due to the presence of significant memory in the series but to its underlying distribution. In fact, it holds that the self-similarity exponent of BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series is similar or lower than the self-similarity index of a random series with the same distribution. As such, several periods with significant antipersistent memory in BTC-USD (resp., S&P500) series are distinguished.

TI TrustChain: A Privacy Preserving Blockchain with Edge Computing
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the collection, processing, and analysis of various forms of data including the personal data from billions of objects to generate valuable knowledge, making more innovative services for its stakeholders. Yet, this paradigm continuously suffers from numerous security and privacy concerns mainly due to its massive scale, distributed nature, and scarcity of resources towards the edge of IoT networks. Interestingly, blockchain based techniques offer strong countermeasures to protect data from tampering while supporting the distributed nature of the IoT. However, the enormous amount of energy consumption required to verify each block of data make it difficult to use with resource-constrained IoT devices and with real-time IoT applications. Nevertheless, it can expose the privacy of the stakeholders due to its public ledger system even though it secures data from alterations. Edge computing approaches suggest a potential alternative to centralized processing in order to populate real-time applications at the edge and to reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud computing. Hence, this paper suggests the novel privacy preserving blockchain called TrustChain which combines the power of blockchains with trust concepts to eliminate issues associated with traditional blockchain architectures. This work investigates how TrustChain can be deployed in the edge computing environment with different levels of absorptions to eliminate delays and privacy concerns associated with centralized processing and to preserve the resources in IoT networks.

TI Innovations in intellectual property rights management Their potential

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS ECONOMICS
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to evaluate innovations in intellectual property rights (IPR) databases, techniques and software tools, with an emphasis on selected new developments and their contribution towards achieving advantages for IPR management (IPRM) and wider social benefits. Several industry buzzwords are addressed, such as IPR-linked open data (IPR LOD) databases, blockchain and IPR-related techniques, acknowledged for their contribution in moving towards artificial intelligence (AI) in IPRM. Design/methodology/approach The evaluation, following an original framework developed by the authors, is based on a literature review, web analysis and interviews carried out with some of the top experts from IPR-savvy multinational companies. Findings The paper presents the patent databases landscape, classifying patent offices according to the format of data provided and depicting the state-of-art in the IPR LOD. An examination of existing IPR tools shows that they are not yet fully developed, with limited usability for IPRM. After reviewing the techniques, it is clear that the current state-of-the-art is insufficient to fully address AI in IPR. Uses of blockchain in IPR show that they are yet to be fully exploited on a larger scale. Originality/value A critical analysis of IPR tools, techniques and blockchain allows for the state-of-art to be assessed, and for their current and potential value with regard to the development of the economy and wider society to be considered. The paper also provides a novel classification of patent offices and an original IPR-linked open data landscape.

TI Baseline characteristics and outcomes of the main perpetrator programme
   within the Hampshire Domestic Abuse Prevention Partnership, UK: A mixed
   methods study
SO PLOS ONE
AB Effective perpetrator programmes should be embedded within a community response, engage all types of perpetrators and involve an educational approach that integrates the survivor's voice. The Domestic Abuse Prevention Partnership (DAPP) is a transformative partnership based in the UK that aims to provide an integrated approach for perpetrators and survivors. This pragmatic mixed methods study was conducted to examine the baseline characteristics and individual outcomes of the main perpetrator programme within the DAPP. Applying a triangulation design, routine police re-offending aggregated data, pre- and post-perpetrator programme questionnaires, in-depth interviews with survivors, and focus-group discussions with perpetrators (clients) were integrated. Statistical analysis and thematic analysis were applied to quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The majority of clients (47%) referred through the DAPP (n = 228) described wanting to make their relationship better as the main reason for engaging with the main perpetrators programme. Post-perpetrator programme questionnaires identified positive changes in both emotional behaviours and physical behaviours amongst clients, which were also supported by examples of improved relationships with their children described in survivor interviews. Three themes were described: first, making positive progress; second, impact of the children's module; and concerns around sustaining new behaviours. Over the monitoring period, 1 in 5 clients were either suspected or convicted of domestic abuse crimes following the programme. This suggests that further maintenance of positive behaviours and reinforcements are required for some clients. Given that clients felt children were a strong motivating factor for completing a programme, it seemed paradoxical that no specialist services were made available for them. Future reiterations of the DAPP model should at least address how best to work with children in families where domestic abuse occurs.

TI Evaluating cryptocurrency laundering as a complex socio-technical system
   A systematic literature review
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to present the findings from a literature review, which aimed to identify previous studies evaluating cryptolaundering from a systems thinking perspective. The aim of this paper is to first confirm that cryptolaundering systems can indeed be defined as complex socio-technical systems and second to present the findings from a systematic review of the literature to determine the extent to which previous research has adopted a systems thinking perspective. Design/methodology/approach The study involved a SLR of studies published in the peer-reviewed literature between 2009 and 2018. Rasmussen's risk management framework (Rasmussen, 1997) was used to evaluate the extent to which a systems thinking perspective had been adopted. Findings The cryptolaundering process is considered to be a complex socio-technical system. The review demonstrates that no previous studies have defined cryptolaundering as a complex socio-technical system or used systems thinking framework approach to evaluate how criminals, regulatory bodies or law enforcement entities understand processes and assess risk within cryptolaundering systems. It is argued that using such an approach to the cryptolaundering process would likely improve assessing criminal risk analyses of cryptolaundering and assist law enforcement and regulatory bodies with understanding risk management during the laundering of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value Future assessments of cryptolaundering using socio-technical system analytical processes may afford law enforcement and regulatory bodies the opportunity to improve intervention techniques and identify gaps in regulations and enforcement.

TI Blockchain-Based Secure Device Management Framework for an Internet of
   Things Network in a Smart City
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The broadly configured smart city network requires a variety of security considerations for a heterogeneous device environment. Because a network of heterogeneous devices facilitates an attacker's intrusion through a specific device or node, a device management framework is required to manage each node comprehensively. This paper proposes a blockchain-based device management framework for efficient device management, scalable firmware update and resiliences on attacks against smart city network. This framework offers four device management and firmware update mechanisms based on the performance and requirements of each device: bidirectional mechanism of general end node and a unidirectional mechanism of the lightweight end node. This difference optimizes the resource of network and devices in terms of management and security. All management history of each device is stored in the blockchain and transmitting firmware between vendor and management node is conducted through a smart contract of blockchain for security and resilience on the attack. Through the framework proposed in this paper, the confidentiality and availability of device management on smart city network as well as integrity, auditability, adaptability and authentication for each node are ensured and the effectiveness of the proposed framework is presented through the security analysis.

TI Administrative Reforms in the Fourth Industrial Revolution: The Case of
   Blockchain Use
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The increasing interest in blockchain since the end of 2017 has induced many attempts to apply it to public sector administration. Blockchains have been shown to improve the levels of economic efficiency, security and decentralization in administration. This exploratory study examines the determinants of blockchain administration and their priorities through an analytic-hierarchy process (AHP) analysis. The priority ranking of internal factors was security, economic efficiency, and decentralization. The introduction of blockchains in the evolution of the current e-government to the future of convergent governments will be generalized through trial, error, and learning processes. As experienced both in the knowledge and information society and in the e-government development process, reforming government administration is not solely a technical problem. The study results suggest that future blockchain administration in the public sector be used in the field of e-voting to encourage citizen participation in the process of agenda-setting, to enhance the level of security and transparency of taxation, and to increase the level of equity. Blockchain technology can also be used to improve efficiency in the provision of individually oriented social welfare services. Its adoption via administrative reform may reduce the level of corruption in personnel management, recruitment, and procurement in public sector organizations.

TI Detecting West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Prices' Bubble Periods
SO ENERGIES
AB Oil prices have had considerable surges and bursts since the first oil crisis of 1973. Until then its price was stable, with almost zero volatility. Since then, apart from the two oil crises of 1973 and 1978/9, oil prices had consecutive bubble episodes like the surges up to 2008 and 2014 and their successive bursts, respectively. The trace of these bubble periods is of crucial importance for policymakers, since their drivers and consequences impact global economic developments. Phillips et al. and Phillips et al. methodologies are applied to detect whether West Texas Intermediate prices experienced bubble periods. Both methodologies suggest that WTI prices experienced explosive episodes, which could be fundamentally, speculatively, or politically attributed. Some suggested periods coincide for both methods, but the second methodology seems to be more sensitive than its predecessor is, leading to better bubble detection but also to identification of non-existent bubbles. The identified bubble periods are compared to relevant research in the literature concerning their presence, duration, and explosiveness. The main goal of the research, apart from the detection of bubbles' presence and duration, is to identify the causal underlying reasons for each explosive episode. Further, we compare the start and endpoints of each bubble episode with time-points when structural changes occurred. The contribution of the paper is that it clearly defines the bubble episodes with their corresponding drivers. The paper identifies the importance of market fundamentals' swifts in explaining the bubble periods. The findings of the papers can help policymakers and other stakeholders to monitor oil price shifts and their underlying reasons, and then proceed with prompt actions. Since bubble episodes are fundamentally explained, then the practical utility is that by focusing on the market fundamentals, stakeholders can avoid actions that could result in market failures.

To this end, we present BlockDeepNet, a Blockchain-based secure DL that combines DL and blockchain to support secure collaborative DL in IoT. In BlockDeepNet, collaborative DL is performed at the device level to overcome privacy leak and obtain enough data for DL, whereas blockchain is employed to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of collaborative DL in IoT. The experimental evaluation shows that BlockDeepNet can achieve higher accuracy for DL with acceptable latency and computational overhead of blockchain operation.

TI Volatility forecasting, downside risk, and diversification benefits of
   Bitcoin and oil and international commodity markets: A comparative
   analysis with yellow metal
SO NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB This study examines the diversification and hedging properties of Bitcoin (BTC) and gold assets for oil and S&P GSCI investors. We model and forecast the volatility performance of the pairs BTC-oil, gold-oil, BTC-S&P GSCI, and gold-GSCI using five bivariate DCC-GARCH family models, two popular forecasting measures (MSE and MAE), the Diebold and Mariano (1995) test, and different risk measures (value-at-risk, expected shortfall, semivariance, and regret) for different portfolios. We find that BTC and gold provide diversification benefits for oil and S&P GSCI. Moreover, by comparing the fitting and forecast performances of the five GARCH models, we find that the standard GARCH model is the best for the gold-oil and BTC-S&P GSCI pairs, while the HYGARCH model is the best for the BTC-oil and gold-S&P GSCI pairs regardless of the time horizon. Finally, we find strong evidence of hedging effectiveness and downside risk reductions, confirming the importance of BTC and gold in oil and S&P GSCI portfolio management.

TI CAPER: A Cross-Application Permissioned Blockchain
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions, should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a permissioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order cross-application transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of CAPER in terms of performance and scalability.

TI Crypto-coin hierarchies: social contestation in blockchain networks
SO GLOBAL NETWORKS-A JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL AFFAIRS
AB In this article, I discuss the role of crypto-coins (CCs) as an explicit response to the 2008 economic crisis. Drawing on networked social movement theory, I outline the tension between blockchain based currencies promoted as horizontal markets of technological innovation and the persistence of hierarchical authority within these networks. By examining the assumptions about authority and regulation that underpin the creation of CCs I argue that the cryptographic responses to the financial crisis understate the persistence of hierarchies in their claims to upset traditional monetary authority. As global networks, blockchain technology faces political challenges from regulators, hegemonic market actors and adherents devoted to particular CCs. Consequently, I draw parallels between CCs and networked social movements to argue that the emergence and proliferation of 'altcoins' presents a series of political challenges to the framing of CCs as disruptive technology. The innovative character of CCs relies on tacit and explicit assumptions about politics that social movement theory can help to explain. By examining the altcoins through the concepts of resource mobilization, framing and identity formation, I argue that the dynamics of offline social hierarchies persist and are magnified in the world of CCs.

TI The promise of peer-to-peer trading? The potential impact of blockchain
   on the actor configuration in the Dutch electricity system
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB This paper considers the potential of blockchain technology to empower distributed and decentralized local electricity markets. Although blockchain has gained considerable attention in the last few years as a facilitator for new electricity markets, no attention has yet been given to its potential influence on the configuration of the actors in the electricity system and its ability to transform the existing system. Based on a social network analysis, this paper investigates how blockchain can influence the actor configuration of the electricity system in the Netherlands. After describing the Dutch system, we compare the existing with the potential future system' actor configuration and the corresponding expected shifts in functions and network position of the actors. We conclude that although many functions are likely to remain and new central authorities may be formed, the impact of blockchain does not seem to be as disruptive and decentralizing as may be expected. This study provides first contributions to the ongoing discussion about the potential of blockchain to disrupt and reshape the electricity system.

TI Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts in terms of Law of Obligations
   and Data Protection Law
SO ISTANBUL HUKUK MECMUASI
AB Blockchain technology is essentially a registry that records data in encrypted form, which is not kept by a central organization, and all information in encrypted form is shared with every participant in the system. The transactions carried out in this register are recorded in blocks, these blocks are linked to each other and each new transaction must be kept unchanged with the information of the previous transactions in order to be approved. For this reason, blockchain technology is considered to be a technology that eliminates intermediary institutions, offers equal opportunities to every participant and is almost impossible to manipulate. In particular, the digital currency, referred to as co Bitcoin, is based on this technology, but blockchain technology is not limited to this. There is no uniform appearance of the blockchain technology.
   Smart contracts, which provide a framework for transactions on the blockchain network, allow system participants to make many different transactions among them by simply going beyond crypto currency transactions.
   However, blockchain technology based on the principle that the transaction history cannot be changed and the smart contracts associated with this technology also bring many problems in terms of data protection law and law of obligations.
   The aim of this study is to evaluate block-chain technology in terms of our current legal order, especially in terms of data protection law and law of obligations.

TI Information asymmetry in initial coin offerings (ICOs): Investigating
   the effects of multiple channel signals
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB An initial coin offering (ICO) provides a new entrepreneurial finance approach for highly innovative blockchain ventures. However, the information asymmetry and adverse selection is severe in the ICO market. In this study, we focus on signals released in multiple channels in different ICO stages to investigate the relations between signal processing and information asymmetry. Referring to the multiple-channel communication theory, we characterize signal sources by their information schema, source credibility, and communication direction. Empirical results indicate that in the crowd sale stage, high credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant influences on token sales. In the listing stage, low credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant effects on token trading. High credible and hard-interpretable signals, which deliver project fundamental information, lose their functions in both stages, causing information asymmetry in ICOs. We also find that investor comments on social media, which is a multiple-way communication channel, play the role of information surveillance for ventures' voluntary disclosures. Those findings provide insights for signal processing and asset pricing in the ICO market to reduce information asymmetry and have significant practical implications.

TI An Image Authentication Scheme Using Merkle Tree Mechanisms
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Research on digital image processing has become quite popular and rapid in recent years, and scholars have proposed various image verification mechanisms. Similarly , blockchain technology has also become very popular in recent years. This paper proposes a new image verification mechanism based on the Merkle tree technique in the blockchain. The Merkle tree root in the blockchain mechanism provides a reliable environment for storage of image features. In image verification, the verification of each image can be performed by the Merkle tree mechanism to obtain the hash value of the Merkle tree node on the path. In addition, the method combines the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) to improve the availability of images. The main purpose of this paper is to achieve the goal of image integrity verification. The proposed method can not only verify the integrity of the image but also restore the tampered area in the case of image tampering. Since the proposed method employs the blockchain mechanism, the image verification mechanism does not need third party resources . The verification method is performed by each node in the blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully achieved the goal of image authentication and tampered area restoration.

TI Scalable and Secure Internet of Things Connectivity
SO ELECTRONICS
AB The Internet of things (IoT) technology, which is currently considered the new growth engine of the fourth industrial revolution, affects our daily life and has been applied to various industrial fields. Studies on overcoming the limitations of scalability and stability in a centralized IoT operating environment by employing distributed blockchain technology have been actively conducted. However, the nature of IoT that ensures connectivity with multiple objects at any time and any place increases security threats. Further, it extends the influence of the cyber world into the physical domain, resulting in serious damage to human life and property. Therefore, we aim to study a method to increase the security of IoT devices and effectively extend them simultaneously. To this end, we analyze the authentication methods and limitations of traditional IoT devices and examine cases for improving IoT environments by using blockchain technology. Accordingly, we propose a framework that allows IoT devices to be securely connected and extended to other devices by automatically evaluating security using blockchain technology and the whitelist. The method proposed in this paper restricts the extension of devices vulnerable to security risks by imposing penalties and allows only devices with high security to be securely and quickly authenticated and extended without user intervention. In this study, we applied the proposed method to IoT network simulation environments and observed that the number of devices vulnerable to security was reduced by 48.5% compared with traditional IoT environments.

Our findings are consistent with the AMH and show that the efficiency of the markets varies over time. We also discuss possible news and events which coincide with significant changes in the market efficiency. Furthermore, we analyse the effect of the sentiment of these news and other factors (events) on the market efficiency in the high frequency setting, and provide a simple event analysis to investigate whether specific factors affect the market efficiency/inefficiency. The results show that the sentiment and types of news and events may not be significant factor in determining the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets.

TI SPB: A Secure Private Blockchain-Based Solution for Distributed Energy
   Trading
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Blockchain is increasingly being used to provide a distributed, secure, trusted, and private framework for energy trading in smart grids. However, existing solutions suffer from a lack of privacy, processing and packet overheads, and reliance on trusted third party (TTP) to secure the trade. To address these challenges, we propose a secure private blockchain (SPB) framework. SPB enables energy producers and consumers to directly negotiate the energy price. To reduce the associated overheads, we propose a routing method which routes packets based on the destination public key (PK). SPB eliminates the reliance on TTP to ensure both energy producer and consumer commit to their obligations by introducing atomic meta-transactions. The latter consists of two transactions: first the consumer generates a CTP transaction, committing to pay the energy price to the producer. On receipt of the energy, the smart meter of the consumer generates an energy receipt confirmation (ERC) which triggers a smart contract to transfer the committed price in CTP to the energy producer. To verify that the ERC is generated by a genuine smart meter, SPB supports authentication of anonymous smart meters to prevent malicious nodes from linking ERC transactions and thus enhance the user privacy. Qualitative security analysis shows the resilience of SPB against a range of attacks. Implementation results demonstrate that SPB reduces monetary cost and delay compared to existing solutions.

TI A fair contract signing protocol with blockchain support
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Electronically signing contracts is fundamental for e-commerce transactions. The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security.

By analysing a crisis that occurred with one of its frontrunners, Ethereum, in this article I explore the discrepancies between the purported governance of blockchains and the de facto control of them through expertise and reputation. Ethereum is also thought to exemplify libertarian techno-utopianism. When 'The DAO', a highly publicized but faulty crowd-funded venture fund was deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, the techno-utopianism was suspended, and developers fell back on strong network ties. Now that the blockchain technology is seeing an increasing uptake, I shall also seek to unearth broader implications of the blockchain for the proliferation or blockage of global finance and beyond. Contrasting claims about the disruptive nature of the technology, in this article I show that, by redeeming the positive utopia of ontic, individualized debt, blockchains reinforce our belief in a crisis-ridden, financialized capitalism.

AB The global financial crisis and the contemporaneous emergence of the digital currency Bitcoin invite us to think about money and how it often functions almost imperceptibly in society. In this article, we show that Bitcoin is a 'new object of concern' that also compels us to reimagine ethnography in a digital age. We present a method, which we term ethno-resonance, that is both a reaction to the conditions presented by the Bitcoin phenomenon and a way of maintaining critical distance from its cyberlibertarian politics. We explicate six aspects of the method, framed around answers to what, why, how, who, when and where questions. Applied to cryptocurrencies, the method leads us to depict Bitcoin as a game, and we analyse the game's dynamics through mapping the interplay between four foundational myths that animate, complicate and sustain the game. More broadly, this contributes to our understanding of the nature of money and alternative currencies.

TI Building Information Management (BIM) and Blockchain (BC) for
   Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework
SO ELECTRONICS
AB At present, sustainable design is experiencing energy consumption and cost-effectiveness challenges in the building industry. A recent body of literature argues that the development of emerging smart digital technologies, such as Building Information Management (BIM) and blockchain (BC), offer immediate benefits to the industry. However, the current application of BIM and BC in the sustainable design and construction process focuses on smart energy and construction management, with little attention to addressing challenges for applying BIM to sustainable design and proposing strategies in terms of the usability of these technologies in the management of building construction projects. Therefore, this paper sets out to explore the potential roles of an integrated BIM and BC approach for sustainable building design information management. The first attempt is presented to use BC aided BIM for sustainable building design coordination and collaboration in multiple building stages. BC has the potential to address challenges that hinder the industry from using BIM for sustainable design, which has been unearthed. An innovative BC enhanced transaction process in BIM is required for sustainable building development. Roles of a user level driven smart contract system of BC can be used to enhance BIM system in the sustainable buildings process. The role of BC is primarily at user level driven smart contracts and their record value exchange capabilities. A user level (BIM stakeholders) driven BC technology for transaction in BIM process flow is revealed, and the user level (sustainable building design project stakeholders/BIM clients) driven and the smart contract enabled BIM+ BC architecture to address challenges of BIM for sustainable design has been further circulated according to the literature. Subsequently, a conceptual architecture of BIM + BC for Sustainable Building Design Information Management Framework in building project management has been proposed, validated, and refined. The Framework has two level encompassing structures and flow. The high-level framework is focused on strategy, whilst the low-level framework demonstrates technical components in detail. This architecture supporting project stakeholders in managing information, has the potential to achieve and ensure the realization of sustainable design goals through the interactive realization of smart contracts integrated into the user level driven BIM + BC system and its recording value exchange function through three user-driven levels, namely user, system, and transaction.

TI Fork-free hybrid consensus with flexible Proof-of-Activity
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain mechanism have been attracting much attention. One of their core innovations, Proof-of-Work (PoW), is notoriously inefficient which potentially motivates a centralization of hash power, defeating the original goal of decentralization. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is later proposed to replace PoW. However, both PoW and PoS have different inherent advantages and disadvantages, so does Proof-of-Activity (PoA) of Bentov et al. (SIGMETRICS 2014) which only offers limited hybrids of two mechanisms. On the other hand, the hybrid consensus protocol of Pass and Shi (DISC 2017) aims to improve the efficiency by dynamically maintaining a rotating committee. Yet, there are unsatisfactory issues including chain forks and fair committee election.
   In this paper, we firstly devise a generalized variant of PoW. After that, we leverage our generalized PoW to construct a fork-free hybrid consensus protocol. We further combine our fork-free hybrid consensus mechanism with PoS for a flexible version of PoA with tunable parameters between PoW and PoS. Compared with Bentov et al.'s PoA, our "flexible PoA" improves the efficiency, leading to a more applicable consensus protocol. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Caterpillar: A business process execution engine on the Ethereum
   blockchain
SO SOFTWARE-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
AB Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, allow a set of actors to maintain a ledger of transactions without relying on a central authority and to deploy programs, called smart contracts, that are executed whenever certain transactions occur. These features can be used as basic building blocks for executing collaborative business processes between mutually untrusting parties. However, implementing business processes using the low-level primitives provided by blockchain platforms is cumbersome and error-prone. In contrast, established business process management systems (BPMSs), such as those based on the standard Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), provide convenient abstractions for rapid development of process-oriented applications. This article demonstrates how to combine the advantages of a BPMS with those of a blockchain platform. The article introduces a blockchain-based BPMN execution engine, named Caterpillar. Like any BPMN execution engine, Caterpillar supports the creation of instances of a process model and allows users to monitor the state of process instances and to execute tasks thereof. The specificity of Caterpillar is that the state of each process instance is maintained on the (Ethereum) blockchain and the workflow routing is performed by smart contracts generated by a BPMN-to-Solidity compiler. The Caterpillar compiler supports a large array of BPMN constructs, including subprocesses, multiple-instance activities, and event handlers. The paper describes the architecture of Caterpillar and the interfaces it provides to support the monitoring of process instances, the allocation and execution of work items, and the execution of service tasks.

TI Cryptocurrencies: Dust in the wind?
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Analogous to the way wind blows single grains of sand and the subsequent settling back atop sand dunes, we find statistical evidence to claim that the prices of cryptocurrencies exhibit similar unpredicted patterns, characterized by positive or negative jumps. Motivated by extant evidence of asset returns' non-normality, we capture distributional properties of the log-returns of the Bitcoin and the following three cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization (Ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin cash). The total error induced by the fitted distribution is remarkably decreased when the generalized hyperbolic distribution is used, a finding further validated by a series of goodness-of-fit type statistical tests. A complementary analysis for the foreign exchange market is conducted, with inherent similarities to that of cryptocurrencies. We reveal that the generalized hyperbolic distribution can also be used to model very widely traded currency pairs significantly more accurately than the log-normal. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI A blockchain based approach for the definition of auditable Access
   Control systems
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB This work proposes to exploit blockchain technology to define Access Control systems that guarantee the auditability of access control policies evaluation. The key idea of our proposal is to codify attribute-based Access Control policies as smart contracts and deploy them on a blockchain, hence transforming the policy evaluation process into a completely distributed smart contract execution. Not only the policies, but also the attributes required for their evaluation are managed by smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. The auditability property derives from the immutability and transparency properties of blockchain technology. This paper not only presents the proposed Access Control system in general, but also its application to the innovative reference scenario where the resources to be protected are themselves smart contracts. To prove the feasibility of our approach, we present a reference implementation exploiting XACML policies and Solidity written smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, we evaluate the system performances through a set of experimental results, and we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of our proposal. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB We propose a bitcoin-based exchange rate of USD/EUR and investigate market efficiency in the spot, futures, and forward FX markets. Structural-change, unit-root and Johansen tests indicate that the bitcoin exchange rate is a random walk and is co-integrated with the FX series. Inferences regarding the co-integrating coefficients suggest the long-run "unbiasedness" and short-run "fair game" nature of the bitcoin exchange rate. Our results are indicative of weak or semi-strong market efficiency.

TI Blockchain Meets Database: Design and Implementation of a Blockchain
   Relational Database
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB In this paper, we design and implement the first-ever decentralized replicated relational database with blockchain properties that we term blockchain relational database. We highlight several similarities between features provided by blockchain platforms and a replicated relational database, although they are conceptually different, primarily in their trust model. Motivated by this, we leverage the rich features, decades of research and optimization, and available tooling in relational databases to build a blockchain relational database. We consider a permissioned blockchain model of known, but mutually distrustful organizations each operating their own database instance that are replicas of one another. The replicas execute transactions independently and engage in decentralized consensus to determine the commit order for transactions. We design two approaches, the first where the commit order for transactions is agreed upon prior to executing them, and the second where transactions are executed without prior knowledge of the commit order while the ordering happens in parallel. We leverage serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) to guarantee that the replicas across nodes remain consistent and respect the ordering determined by consensus, and devise a new variant of SSI based on block height for the latter approach. We implement our system on PostgreSQL and present detailed performance experiments analyzing both approaches.

TI Some issues in blockchain for accounting and the supply chain, with an
   application of distributed databases to virtual organizations
SO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN ACCOUNTING FINANCE & MANAGEMENT
AB This paper reviews some recent blockchain-based applications for information capture, distribution and preservation. As part of that review, this paper examines two key concerns with current blockchain designs for accounting and supply chain transactions: data independence and multiple semantic models for the same information distribution problem. Blockchain applications typically integrate database, application and presentation tiers all in the same ledger. This results in a general inability to query information in the ledger and other concerns. Further, since most applications appear to be private blockchain applications, there is a concern of agents needing to accommodate multiple blockchains depending on who their trading partners are and what they request. Finally, this paper uses a distributed database to design a 'blockchain-like' system for virtual organizations.

TI Using Blockchain to Rein in the New Post-Truth World and Check the
   Spread of Fake News
SO IT PROFESSIONAL
AB In recent years, "fake news" has become a global issue that raises unprecedented challenges for human society and democracy. This problem has arisen due to the emergence of various concomitant phenomena such as 1) the digitization of human life and the ease of disseminating news through social networking applications (such as Facebook and WhatsApp); 2) the availability of "big data" that allows customization of news feeds and the creation of polarized so-called "filter-bubbles"; and 3) the rapid progress made by generative machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in creating realistic-looking yet fake digital content (such as text, images, and videos). There is a crucial need to combat the rampant rise of fake news and disinformation. In this article, we propose a high-level overview of a blockchain-based framework for fake news prevention and highlight the various design issues and consideration of such a blockchain-based framework for tackling fake news.

TI LIBERALISING BLOCKCHAIN: AN APPLICATION OF THE GATS DIGITAL TRADE
   FRAMEWORK
SO MELBOURNE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB Blockchain technology and the World Trade Organization share the same principles of liberalisation and democratisation of trade. Relying on cross-border data flows and an open environment, blockchain platforms, such as Bitcoin and smart contracts, dispense with a central intermediary and distribute the function of validating transactions to a peer-to-peer network of participants, who maintain and update a record of all transactions in a transparent and immutable distributed ledger. The General Agreement on Trade in Services ('GATS') as the only multilateral treaty that creates binding international obligations on the treatment to be accorded to service suppliers, including online services provides a solid foundational framework for services supplied by participants on blockchain, even if, unsurprisingly, several grey areas exist. Applying GATS to blockchain means that many prohibitive regulations imposed by countries from banning mining to criminalising the possession of cryptocurrencies may be considered barriers to trade.

TI Leveraging the Internet of Things and Blockchain Technology in Supply
   Chain Management
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB Modern supply chains have evolved into highly complex value networks and turned into a vital source of competitive advantage. However, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the source of raw materials and maintain visibility of products and merchandise while they are moving through the value chain network. The application of the Internet of Things (IoT) can help companies to observe, track, and monitor products, activities, and processes within their respective value chain networks. Other applications of IoT include product monitoring to optimize operations in warehousing, manufacturing, and transportation. In combination with IoT, Blockchain technology can enable a broad range of different application scenarios to enhance value chain transparency and to increase B2B trust. When combined, IoT and Blockchain technology have the potential to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of modern supply chains. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we illustrate how the deployment of Blockchain technology in combination with IoT infrastructure can streamline and benefit modern supply chains and enhance value chain networks. Second, we derive six research propositions outlining how Blockchain technology can impact key features of the IoT (i.e., scalability, security, immutability and auditing, information flows, traceability and interoperability, quality) and thus lay the foundation for future research projects.

TI Regulation as both enabler of technology use and global competitive
   tool: The Gibraltar case
SO GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY
AB Distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) such as Blockchain appear to have disruptive economic potential to traditional finance-sector and non-financial markets as the success of crypto currencies demonstrates. While traditional financial and securities markets are highly regulated, DLT transactions and exchanges have so far widely remained unregulated, which potentially poses major threats to individual investors and, via money laundering, terrorist financing, and tax evasion, to society at large. Governments have been taking different approaches to monitoring and regulating the fledgling DLT provision arena. However, the small jurisdiction of Gibraltar, an affluent self-governed and self-financed British overseas territory with a population of 34,000 at the Southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula has taken a proactive approach. What makes this case stand out is that Gibraltar is not only is the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate general DLT provision, but it is rather using the regulation as a competitive tool and a means for creating new public value. The study inquires the potential benefits and challenges to this particular approach to DLT provision regulation, and it investigates and presents the various facets of public value generation, which might serve as a poster child for fast and smart regulation in the digital age.

TI Smart Contract-Based Pool Hopping Attack Prevention for Blockchain
   Networks
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB Pool hopping attack is the result of miners leaving the pool when it offers fewer financial rewards and joining back when the rewards of mining yield higher rewards in blockchain networks. This act of leaving and rejoining the pool only during the good times results in the miner receiving more rewards than the computational power they contribute. Miners exiting the pool deprive it of its collective hash power, which leaves the pool unable to mine the block successfully. This results in its competitors mining the block before they can finish mining. Existing research shows pool hopping resistant measures and detection strategies; however, they do not offer any robust preventive solution to discourage miners from leaving the mining pool. To prevent pool hopping attacks, a smart contract-based pool hopping attack prevention model is proposed. The main objective of our research is maintaining the symmetrical relationship between the miners by requiring them all to continually contribute their computational power to successfully mine a block. We implement a ledger containing records of all miners, in the form of a miner certificate, which tracks the history of the miner's earlier behavior. The certificate enables a pool manager to better initiate terms of the smart contract, which safeguards the interests of existing mining pool members. The model prevents frequent mine hoppers from pool hopping as they submit coins in the form of an escrow and risk losing them if they abandon the pool before completing mining of the block. The key critical factors that every pool hopping attack prevention solution must address and a study of comparative analysis with existing solutions are presented in the paper.

TI Digital Payments: Impact Factors and Mass Adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB This study explores impact factors that affect the adoption of digital payment systems in sub-Saharan Africa. In this article, we investigate the impact factors that subject-matter experts consider most important to the success of FinTech payment models. The data and their responses are evaluated through the lens of Christensen's market-creation theory, which contends that the adoption of market-creating innovations by a mass swathe of heretofore non-consumers "pulls" framework conditions into place, including missing infrastructure and enabling regulation. Then, we compare the findings with the literature and three case studies of mobile money adoption in Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. This study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the payment and money transfer segment of FinTech innovations in Africa using a multiple case study methodology. We drew together information from multiple sources, including semi-structured interviews, archival data in the form of industry and regulatory reports, and observational field notes. Our findings suggest that enabling environments (Kenya) do jumpstart adoption and difficult frameworks (Nigeria) do evolve. This study will help FinTech innovators, academics, and policymakers to understand how technology and framework conditions impact payment business models in Africa.

AB Digital assets termed cryptocurrencies are creating new paradigms for financial transactions as well as alternative means of capital. Despite their increasing relevance in financial situations, a complete understanding of the entire system remains lacking. Here the cryptocurrency market is treated as a complex system and analyzed using methods from statistical physics. The complexity-entropy causality plane (or CH plane) is employed in order to explore disorder and complexity in the space of cryptocurrencies. They are found to exist on distinct planar locations in the representation space, ranging from structured to stochastic-like behavior. The temporal trajectories of entropy and statistical complexity of prices vary drastically with position along the plane. Lastly cryptocurrencies appear to be characterized by ordinal patterns that represent strictly decreasing or increasing trends in price. The present analysis expands the understanding of and helps to quantify varying degrees of complexity in cryptocurrencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Influence of the molecular weight in P3HT block on fully conjugated
   block copolymers
SO SYNTHETIC METALS
AB All-conjugated donor-acceptor block copolymers (BCP) were synthesized in a one-pot reaction by a Stille coupling polycondensation through a terminal functional polymer copolymerization process. Mono bromo endfunctionalized P3HT samples with various molecular weights (P3HT-Br, M-n: 5, 9, and 26 kg/mol) were copolymerized with AA (N,N'-Bis(2-decy1-1-tetradecy1)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide, NDI) and BB (5,5'-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2'-bithiophene) type monomers. Further purification by preparative GPC removed excess P3HT to yield block copolymers of low polydispersities with different donor and acceptor block chain lengths. The block copolymers were characterized by H-1-NMR and UV-vis absorption and FTIR spectroscopy. The optical properties, film morphologies, and optoelectronic properties of the block co-polymer were strongly influenced by the donor and acceptor block chain lengths. Furthermore, the fully conjugated D-A block copolymer films exhibited fine structures, smooth film morphologies, and better OPV performance than those features of P3HT/PNDIT2 polymer blends. In polymer solar cells based on the various block copolymer as active layers, the device power convention efficiency was improved by maintaining the acceptor block content at 40-50 kg/mol and increasing the P3HT chain from 5 to 26 kg/mol.

TI Blockchain-based secure and fair crowdsourcing scheme
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB The crowdsourcing schemes which utilize the social network to solve complex tasks are an important part of open cooperation over the Internet. Although blockchain-based crowdsourcing schemes have considerable advantages in decentralization and data sharing, there is still a challenge to gurantee the security of crowdsourced-sensitive information and the fairness of crowdsourcing on the blockchain. To this end, this article investigates a crowdsourcing scheme based on blockchain. First, we define the basic requirements of blockchain-based crowdsourcing schemes including fairness, confidentiality, and integrity. And then, using secure hash, commitment, and homomorphic encryption, we propose a blockchain-based secure and fair crowdsourcing scheme, that is, BFC. The analysis results show that our scheme can satisfy the above requirements. Finally, the experimental results show that the computational overhead of the BFC scheme is acceptable to both the requester and the workers. In a word, our proposed crowdsourcing scheme has good expansibility in reality.

TI Security and Privacy on Blockchain
SO ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.

TI FinBrain: when finance meets AI 2.0
SO FRONTIERS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is the core technology of technological revolution and industrial transformation. As one of the new intelligent needs in the AI 2.0 era, financial intelligence has elicited much attention from the academia and industry. In our current dynamic capital market, financial intelligence demonstrates a fast and accurate machine learning capability to handle complex data and has gradually acquired the potential to become a "financial brain." In this paper, we survey existing studies on financial intelligence. First, we describe the concept of financial intelligence and elaborate on its position in the financial technology field. Second, we introduce the development of financial intelligence and review state-of-the-art techniques in wealth management, risk management, financial security, financial consulting, and blockchain. Finally, we propose a research framework called FinBrain and summarize four open issues, namely, explainable financial agents and causality, perception and prediction under uncertainty, risk-sensitive and robust decision-making, and multi-agent game and mechanism design. We believe that these research directions can lay the foundation for the development of AI 2.0 in the finance field.

TI A secure large-scale instant payment system based on blockchain
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Off-chain payments are an important technique for improving the scalability of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. However, since tokens locked in off-chain channels cannot circulate from one channel to another, current off-chain payment systems have a limitation in their capacities. In this work, we present a secure large-scale instant payment (SLIP) system to improve the capacity of blockchain systems. The SLIP system uses an aggregate signature scheme to connect some of the off-chain channels such that tokens locked in these channels can circulate from one channel to the next. Therefore, the amount of circulated tokens in these channels is the sum of all locked-in tokens instead of the minimum locked-in tokens. In other words, it improves the negotiability of tokens locked in these connected off-chains channels. Besides, as payers can aggregate the signatures incrementally, payees only need to verify a line of transactions once in each transaction while nodes (miners) who maintain the blockchain system only need to verify all transactions once for all, which makes the SLIP system very efficient. We prove that if the underlying blockchain system is secure, and aggregate signature satisfies aggregate chosen-key security, then the SLIP system is secure. Finally, analyses show that the capacity of the SLIP system is much larger than the Lightning Network. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Recent Advances in Cryptovirology: State-of-the-Art Crypto Mining and
   Crypto Ransomware Attacks
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Recently, ransomware has earned itself an infamous reputation as a force to reckon with in the cybercrime landscape. However, cybercriminals are adopting other unconventional means to seamlessly attain proceeds of cybercrime with little effort. Cybercriminals are now acquiring cryptocurrencies directly from benign Internet users without the need to extort a ransom from them, as is the case with ransomware. This paper investigates advances in the cryptovirology landscape by examining the state-of-the-art cryptoviral attacks. In our approach, we perform digital autopsy on the malware's source code and execute the different malware variants in a contained sandbox to deduce static and dynamic properties respectively. We examine three cryptoviral attack structures: browser-based crypto mining, memory resident crypto mining and cryptoviral extortion. These attack structures leave a trail of digital forensics evidence when the malware interacts with the file system and generates noise in form of network traffic when communicating with the C2 servers and crypto mining pools. The digital forensics evidence, which essentially are IOCs include network artifacts such as C2 server domains, IPs and cryptographic hash values of the downloaded files apart from the malware hash values. Such evidence can be used as seed into intrusion detection systems for mitigation purposes.

TI Investor Attention and Cryptocurrency Returns: Evidence from Quantile

SO JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL FINANCE
AB The erratic price behavior and inefficiency in the crypto markets offer possibility to examine the behavioral aspects in cryptocurrency prices. Further, the cryptocurrency market is dominated by the retail investor providing an interesting platform to examine the impact of attention-driven trading in this particular asset class. Thus, the authors investigate the influence of investor attention in the cryptocurrency prices using the quantile causality approach. The results indicate that investors pay attention to the frequent news-making and ranked cryptos (Bitcoin and Ethereum). For newer cryptocurrencies like Ripple, investor attention influences their prices only during superior performance. The study provides evidence of attention-induced price pressure hypothesis in the prices of cryptocurrencies during expansionary phases and fear selling during poor market performance.

TI Underscoring archival authenticity with blockchain technology
SO INSIGHTS-THE UKSG JOURNAL
AB Archives have well-established practices which have been developed over years of working with analogue records. Now they face huge challenges due to the inexorable development of digital technologies. Not only is the heterogeneous nature of the records, their instability and the rapid pace of technological development a threat to the records' survival, but the ease with which digital records can be altered has put archives in a technology arms race with those parties who would seek to falsify our digital inheritance and undermine democracy.
   In order to tackle these challenges, the ARCHANGEL project is breaking new ground by using blockchain to record checksums (cryptographic hashes) and other metadata derived from either scanned physical records or born-digital records to allow verification of their integrity over decade- or century-long time spans. This data is permanently preserved through peer-to-peer distribution and consensus checking without the need for a trusted third party, thereby enabling archives to prove the authenticity of the records in their custody.

TI Anomaly detection in Bitcoin market via price return analysis
SO PLOS ONE
AB The Bitcoin market becomes the focus of the economic market since its birth, and it has attracted wide attention from both academia and industry. Due to the absence of regulations in the Bitcoin market, it may be easier to bring some kinds of illegal behaviors. Thus, it raises an interesting question: Is there abnormity or illegal behavior in Bitcoin platforms? To answer this question, we investigate the abnormity in five leading Bitcoin platforms. By analyzing the financial index, i.e. the normalized logarithmic price return, we find that the properties of price return in bitFlyer are completely different from others. To find the possible reasons, we find that the abnormal ask price and bid price appear simultaneously in bitFlyer, which may be potentially linked to either price manipulation or money laundering. It verifies our conjecture that there may be abnormity or price manipulation in Bitcoin platforms. Furthermore, our findings in price return could also provide an innovative and effective method to detect the abnormity in Bitcoin platforms.

TI Study on the Core-Shell Reversion of PSBMA-b-PLMA Nanoparticles for the
   Fabrication of Antifouling Coatings
SO ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES
AB In this paper, two series of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)-b-poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PSBMA-b-PLMA) diblock copolymers were prepared to investigate the core-shell reversion of amphiphilic copolymers. Experimental results proved that the PSBMA-b-PLMA copolymers can be self-assembled as core-shell nanoparticles in chloroform. Moreover, H-1 NMR spectra and contact angle measurements revealed that there is a transitional PSBMA/PLMA block ratio of 0.6, above which the nanoparticles are capable of switching their core and shell in aqueous solution. Consequently, nanoparticles with PSBMA/PLMA block ratios above 0.6 showed superior antifouling and antibacterial abilities to those with block ratios below 0.4. Moreover, it was also found that the block chain length plays an important role in core-shell reversion as evidenced by H-1 NMR spectra, water contact angle, and antifouling tests. As a result, coatings fabricated with the PLMA(100) series of nanoparticles showed better antifouling abilities than those of the PLMA(150) series at the same block ratio probably because of the thinner shell of PLMA(100) copolymers. PSBMA(100)-b-PLMA(100) was proved to be the best candidate for the fabrication of antifouling coatings as it exhibited the highest efficacy in antibacterial adhesion and antiprotein adsorption. This study provided a facile method to fabricate antifouling coatings by developing amphiphilic diblock copolymers with tuned hydrophobic/hydrophilic block ratio, block chain length, etc.

TI Merton's portfolio problem including market frictions: A closed-form
   formula supporting the shadow price approach
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB This paper formulates a portfolio optimization in a friction market as a suitable stochastic control problem with hyperbolic absolute risk aversion utility functions under a specific functional form of the amount of wealth invested in the risky asset inspired by the Merton optimal dynamics. The state variable is the amount of wealth invested in the risky asset, while the control variable is the share rate. This formulation has two advantages. First, it provides a portfolio where the optimality is obtained by minimizing the probability of large changes in the portfolio composition with consequently low frictions, while allowing for an explicit solution to the optimal control problem. Second, with this formulation, it can be proven that this optimal solution is the optimal solution of the frictionless Merton problem for corrected price dynamics. The corrected dynamics shows that the market friction increases the risk premium by an additional term that is an elementary function of the risk associated with the market frictions, as well the price of the risk, which also depends on the risk aversion of the investor. In addition, the corrected dynamics supports the existence of a shadow price in friction markets as already shown in Kallsen and Muhle-Karbe (2010). Finally, an empirical analysis to assess the model performance is illustrated on five-minute data of four major traded stocks, three market indexes, and four exchange rates including the Bitcoin/USD rate.

TI Chaos and order in the bitcoin market
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The bitcoin price has surged in recent years and it has also exhibited phases of rapid decay. In this paper we address the question to what extent this novel cryptocurrency market can be viewed as a classic or semi-efficient market. Novel and robust tools for estimation of multi-fractal properties are used to show that the bitcoin price exhibits a very interesting multi-scale correlation structure. This structure can be described by a power-law behavior of the variances of the returns as functions of time increments and it can be characterized by two parameters, the volatility and the Hurst exponent. These power-law parameters, however, vary in time. A new notion of generalized Hurst exponent is introduced which allows us to check if the multi-fractal character of the underlying signal is well captured. It is moreover shown how the monitoring of the power-law parameters can be used to identify regime shifts for the bitcoin price. A novel technique for identifying the regimes switches based on a goodness of fit of the local power-law parameters is presented. It automatically detects dates that can be associated with some known events in the bitcoin market place. A very surprising result is moreover that, despite the wild ride of the bitcoin price in recent years and its multi-fractal and non-stationary character, this price has both local power-law behaviors and a very orderly correlation structure when it is observed on its entire period of existence.

TI Volatility spillover in crypto-currency markets: Some evidences from
   GARCH and wavelet analysis
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB We study the dynamics of volatility spillover across four major cryptocurrency returns namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin from 15 - 08 - 2015 to 18 - 01 - 2018. In the first step, an IGARCH (1,1)-DCC (1,1) multivariate GARCH model is estimated to quantify the nature of volatility spillovers. From GARCH results, it is seen that there is statistically significant volatility spillover from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Litecoin during the period of analysis. The conditional correlation measures point towards the possibility of moderate return co-movement among the crypto-currency returns. The conditional covariance measures show negligible volatility spillover during the initial periods and provide evidence towards increased volatility spillover after 2017. Wavelet coherence measures shows evidence towards correlation among the crypto-currencies to be persistent across the short run, while the pairwise wavelet cross-spectral analysis confirms the findings obtained from conditional covariance measures. It is found that other crypto-currencies are influenced by fluctuations in bitcoin prices. Overall, the results indicate the possibility of turbulence in the crypto-currency markets and point towards the possibility of herding behaviour in crypto-currency markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

   Methods: Given that there is no ideal design for a DLT-based patient-provider data exchange solution, we proposed two different variations for our proof-of-concept system. One design was based purely on the public IOTA distributed ledger (a directed acyclic graph-based DLT) and the second used the same public IOTA ledger in combination with a private InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) cluster. Both designs were assessed according to (1) data reversal risk, (2) data linkability risks, (3) processing time, (4) file size compatibility, and (5) overall system complexity.
   Results: The public IOTA design slightly increased the risk of personal data linkability, had an overall low processing time (requiring mean 6.1, SD 1.9 seconds to upload one blood glucose data sample into the DLT), and was relatively simple to implement. The combination of the public IOTA with a private IPFS cluster minimized both reversal and linkability risks, allowed for the exchange of large files (3 months of blood glucose data were uploaded into the DLT in mean 38.1, SD 13.4 seconds), but involved a relatively higher setup complexity.
   Conclusions: For the specific use case of blood glucose explored in this study, both designs presented a suitable performance in enabling the interoperable exchange of data between patients and providers. Additionally, both systems were designed considering the latest guidelines on personal data processing, thereby maximizing the alignment with recent GDPR requirements. For future works, these results suggest that the conflict between DLT and data privacy regulations can be addressed if careful considerations are made regarding the use case and the design of the data exchange system.

TI Accelerating Health Data Sharing: A Solution Based on the Internet of
   Things and Distributed Ledger Technologies
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Huge amounts of health-related data are generated every moment with the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technologies. These big health data contain great value and can bring benefit to all stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. Currently, most of these data are siloed and fragmented in different health care systems or public and private databases. It prevents the fulfillment of intelligent health care inspired by these big data. Security and privacy concerns and the lack of ensured authenticity trails of data bring even more obstacles to health data sharing. With a decentralized and consensus-driven nature, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) provide reliable solutions such as blockchain, Ethereum, and IOTA Tangle to facilitate the health care data sharing.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a health-related data sharing system by integrating IoT and DLT to enable secure, fee-less, tamper-resistant, highly-scalable, and granularly-controllable health data exchange, as well as build a prototype and conduct experiments to verify the feasibility of the proposed solution.
   Methods: The health-related data are generated by 2 types of IoT devices: wearable devices and stationary air quality sensors. The data sharing mechanism is enabled by IOTA's distributed ledger, the Tangle, which is a directed acyclic graph. Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) is adopted to facilitate data communications among different parties. Merkle Hash Tree is used for data encryption and verification.
   Results: A prototype system was built according to the proposed solution. It uses a smartwatch and multiple air sensors as the sensing layer; a smartphone and a single-board computer (Raspberry Pi) as the gateway; and a local server for data publishing. The prototype was applied to the remote diagnosis of tremor disease. The results proved that the solution could enable costless data integrity and flexible access management during data sharing.
   Conclusions: DLT integrated with IoT technologies could greatly improve the health-related data sharing. The proposed solution based on IOTA Tangle and MAM could overcome many challenges faced by other traditional blockchain-based solutions in terms of cost, efficiency, scalability, and flexibility in data access management. This study also showed the possibility of fully decentralized health data sharing by replacing the local server with edge computing devices.

TI A Personalized QoS Prediction Method for Web Services via
   Blockchain-Based Matrix Factorization
SO SENSORS
AB Personalized quality of service (QoS) prediction plays an important role in helping users build high-quality service-oriented systems. To obtain accurate prediction results, many approaches have been investigated in recent years. However, these approaches do not fully address untrustworthy QoS values submitted by unreliable users, leading to inaccurate predictions. To address this issue, inspired by blockchain with distributed ledger technology, distributed consensus mechanisms, encryption algorithms, etc., we propose a personalized QoS prediction method for web services that we call blockchain-based matrix factorization (BMF). We develop a user verification approach based on homomorphic hash, and use the Byzantine agreement to remove unreliable users. Then, matrix factorization is employed to improve the accuracy of predictions and we evaluate the proposed BMF on a real-world web services dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, making it much more effective than traditional techniques.

TI Blockchain-Based Badge Award with Existence Proof
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In this paper, we present a badge awarding system for performance assessment in education using blockchain technology. Learners will be awarded badges, which are certified for a predetermined level of progress in terms of learning. All the badges are stored in a backpack, which is an environment for storing and presenting the obtained badges. Badges are immutable and verifiable as well as rigid. The use of badges in the education system makes education more interesting, skill-based, and adaptable to changes. The key contribution of our work is in terms of compatibility with Openbadge specification and integrated cooperating platform between digital badge awarding and blockchaining. Our system implementation is compatible with Open Badges of IMS Global Learning Consortium, which is used to earn, issue, and award badges across various platforms. The badges are trusted by the IMS standard, the criteria to earn a badge is verified through the network, and the overall process is transparent compared to the traditional education system. Moreover, all badge awarding events in our system are recorded in a blockchain. Once stored, the contents cannot be tampered with. Thereafter, anyone can check the validity of the badge through the blockchain. Our platform will be useful for distance learning as well as time and location independent learning. The experimental results are as follows. On a Bitcoin-based digital badge publishing platform, the execution time required to award the badge is 24.53 s, while on the Ethereum-based digital badge publishing platform, the execution time to award the badge is only 3.86 s. It can also be used for career management and personal history. The learners can obtain the current knowledge required for a job. Lifelong learning will be also possible with this platform.

TI An Adaptive Biomedical Data Managing Scheme Based on the Blockchain
   Technique
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB A crucial role is played by personal biomedical data when it comes to maintaining proficient access to health records by patients as well as health professionals. However, it is difficult to get a unified view pertaining to health data that have been scattered across various health centers/hospital sections. To be specific, health records are distributed across many places and cannot be integrated easily. In recent years, blockchain has arisen as a promising solution that helps to achieve the sharing of individual biomedical information in a secure way, whilst also having the benefit of privacy preservation because of its immutability. This research puts forward a blockchain-based managing scheme that helps to establish interpretation improvements pertaining to electronic biomedical systems. In this scheme, two blockchains were employed to construct the base, whereby the second blockchain algorithm was used to generate a secure sequence for the hash key that was generated in first blockchain algorithm. This adaptive feature enables the algorithm to use multiple data types and also combines various biomedical images and text records. All data, including keywords, digital records, and the identity of patients, are private key encrypted with a keyword searching function so as to maintain data privacy, access control, and a protected search function. The obtained results, which show a low latency (less than 750 ms) at 400 requests/second, indicate the possibility of its use within several health care units such as hospitals and clinics.

TI Evaluating Methods for the Identification of Off-Chain Transactions in
   the Lightning Network
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Payment channels and off-chain transactions are used to address blockchain scalability. Those mechanisms rely on the blockchain proper, as the resolution mechanism. They allow for high transaction throughput due to the pure peer-to-peer nature of the transaction exchange that happens directly between the peers, without the involvement of the blockchain transactions. The transactions are not mediated through the blockchain but happen off-chain. The transactions in such overlay networks are not included in the blockchain, they nevertheless leave some data traces in a public ledger. We have used the Bitcoin mainnet and testnet blockchains together with the Lightning network node to explore what can be inferred from the underlying blockchain in the context of Lightning transactions, channel setup, and channel teardown. The main purpose of this study is to identify what methods, transaction signatures, and data can be used to understand the non-visible publicly off-chain transactions. We have proposed heuristics for identifying the setup and teardown transactions, quantified and analyzed the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Using the data from the Bitcoin blockchain, as well as the data from the Lightning network to link related information we have found when parsing the blockchain, we generate network graph representations showing the relationships between the Lightning network channels identified on the blockchain. This study is significant from the personal data and privacy perspectives, as well as from forensics. We have established that at least 75% of all P2WSH transactions are Lightning transactions, and some of the channels can be deduced from the blockchain analysis. The synthesized results demonstrate that our methods are viable for identifying a subset of transactions and that only partial topology of the payment channels can be obtained from the data left in the blockchain.

TI Fusing Identity Management, HL7 and Blockchain into a Global Healthcare
   Record Sharing Architecture
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Healthcare record sharing among various medical roles is a critical and challenging research problem especially in today's everchanging global IT solutions. The emergence of blockchain as a new enabling technology brought radical changes to numerous business applications, including healthcare. Blockchain is a trusted distributed ledger that forms a decentralized infrastructure. There have been several proposals regarding the sharing of critical healthcare records over blockchain infrastructure without requiring prior knowledge/trust of the parties involved (patients, service providers, and insurance companies). Another yet important issue is to securely share medical records across various countries for travelling patients to ensure an integrated and ubiquitous healthcare service. In this paper, we present a globally integrated healthcare record sharing architecture based on blockchain and HL7 client. Healthcare records are stored at the hosting country and are not stored on the blockchain. This architecture avails medical records of travelling patients temporarily and after performing necessary authentication. The actual authorisation process is performed on a federated identity management system, such as, the Shibboleth. Though there are similarities with identity management systems, our system is unique as it involves the patient in the permission process and discloses to them the identities of entities accessed their health records. Our solution also improves performance and guarantees privacy and security through the use of blockchain and identity management system.

AB This paper deals with the analysis of the relationship between cryptocurrencies and gold prices. In particular, we use fractional integration and cointegration techniques to examine the degree of persistence of the series and the possibility of short and long run equilibrium relationships between them. Our results indicate that there is evidence of mean reversion in gold prices and also in some of the cryptocurrencies; however, cointegration is only found in a few cases with a very small degree of cointegration in the long run relationship. Testing the hypothesis of convergence throughout the ratios, again we only found evidence of mean reversion in the cases of Bytecoin, Dash, Ether, Monero and Ether. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Crowdsensing Quality Control and Grading Evaluation Based on a
   Two-Consensus Blockchain
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB With the popularization of intelligent terminals, crowdsensing has become increasingly prominent because of its advantages, such as low cost, high convenience, and fast speed in conducting tasks. However, the quality of the data collected through crowdsensing is varied and is difficult to evaluate. Furthermore, the existing crowdsensing quality control methods are mostly based on a central platform, which is not completely trusted in reality and results in the existence of fraud and other problems. To solve these two questions, a crowdsensing quality control model based on a two-consensus blockchain is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of a blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and the two-consensus approach are proposed to realize the nonrepudiation and nontampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, to help task publishers obtain higher-quality sensing data, the methods of node matching and QGE are proposed. The former method uses the idea of the calculation of matching degree to select workers, and the latter uses the idea of clustering and fuzzy theories to evaluate the quality of the sensing data. Finally, the experiments show that the running time of the block generation in our model is acceptable, and comparing with the other methods, our model can acquire data of higher quality after the addition of malicious nodes.

TI Split Derivatives: Inside the World's Most Misunderstood Contract
SO YALE JOURNAL ON REGULATION
AB Derivatives are the "bad boys" of modern finance: exciting, dangerous, and fundamentally misunderstood. These misunderstandings stem from the failure of scholars and policymakers to fully appreciate the unique legal and economic structure of derivative contracts, along with the important differences between these contracts and conventional equity and debt securities. This Article seeks to correct these misunderstandings by splitting derivative contracts open, identifying their constituent elements, and observing how these elements interact with one another. These elements include some of the world's most sophisticated state-contingent contracting, the allocation of property and decision-making rights, and relational mechanisms such as reputation and the expectation of future dealings. The resulting hybridity essentially splits every derivative into two separate contracts: one that governs under normal market conditions, and another that governs under conditions of fundamental uncertainty. In good times, derivative contracts contemplate the almost automatic determination and performance of each counterparty's obligations. In bad times, these contracts include various mechanisms designed to provide counterparties with the flexibility to incorporate new information, fill contractual gaps, and promote efficient renegotiation.
   The process of splitting derivative contracts open yields a number of important policy insights. First, the bundling of contract, property, decision-making rights, and relational mechanisms makes derivatives look far more like commercial loans than publicly traded shares or bonds. The regulatory treatment of derivatives as "securities "-and the resulting emphasis on market transparency-is thus somewhat misguided and serves to distract attention from the significant prudential risks posed by the widespread use of derivatives. Second, the flexibility associated with the relational mechanisms embedded within many derivative contracts can play a useful role in promoting both institutional and broader financial stability. This has important implications in terms of the desirability of the recent push toward mandatory central clearing of derivative contracts. It also exposes the potential perils of recent proposals to use distributed ledger technology and smart contracts to execute, clear, and settle these contracts. By the same token, the widespread breakdown of these relational mechanisms can be a source of financial instability. This provides a. compelling rationale for authorizing central banks to act as "dealers of last resort" during periods of fundamental uncertainty.

SO JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB Using nationally representative US data, we show that women possess weaker knowledge regarding the characteristics of Bitcoin compared to men. Investigating the determinants driving this gap, we find that socio-demographics and personality traits explain only a small share of the gap. Adding measures for actual and perceived financial literacy explains approximately 40 percent of the gender gap in Bitcoin literacy. Experience with digital technology, in contrast, does not have additional explanatory power. Our results indicate that closing gender gaps in financial literacy is important, but safeguarding financial wellbeing in increasingly digitalized financial systems becomes ever more complex.

TI Digital identity: Contemporary challenges for data protection, privacy
   and non-discrimination rights
SO BIG DATA & SOCIETY
AB The World Bank estimates that over one billion people currently lack official identity documents. To tackle this crucial issue, the United Nations included the aim to provide legal identity for all by 2030 among the Sustainable Development Goals. Technology can be a powerful tool to reach this target. In the digital age, new technologies increasingly mediate identity verification and identification of individuals. Currently, State-led and public-private initiatives use technology to provide official identification, to control and secure external borders, and to distribute humanitarian aid to populations in need. All of these initiatives have profound implications for the protection of human rights of those affected by them. Digital identity technologies may render individuals without legal documentation more visible and therefore less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. However, they also present risks for the protection of individuals' human rights. As they build on personal data for identification and identity verification, data protection and privacy rights are most clearly affected. The prohibition of discrimination in the digital space is also of concern as these technological advances' societal impact is not yet fully understood. Accordingly, the article argues that emerging digital identity platforms will only contribute to the protection of human rights if the providers adequately mitigate any risks of potential discrimination and promote high standards of privacy and data protection.

TI Stochastic asset price dynamics and volatility using a symmetric supply
   and demand price equation
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB A symmetric supply/demand model of price dynamics is developed and used to under- stand the relationship between price change and volatility. This differs from the classical approach in which the expected rate of price change and variance are assumed to be independent. The microeconomic and stochastic analysis leads to the conclusion that a particular measure of the marginal volatility has a minimum shortly before the expected log-price has an extremum. The maximum of the volatility occurs when prices are likely to change most rapidly, and the supply/demand imbalance is greatest. The great bubble and collapse of Bitcoin's price serves as a test of this analysis. The volatility reached a minimum shortly prior to the peak of Bitcoin's price in December 2018. The model is further developed under the assumption that supply and demand depend on the fundamental value of the asset. Thus the paper is a key step in understanding the issue of whether volatility highs and lows can forecast trading price tops and bottoms. The methodology can be extended beyond log-normal returns and is further compared with an empirical study of 40 sharp market boom/bust events studied by Sornette et. al. (2017).

TI Bitcoin fluctuations and the frequency of price overreactions
SO FINANCIAL MARKETS AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
AB This paper investigates the role of the frequency of price overreactions in the cryptocurrency market in the case of BitCoin over the period 2013-2018. Specifically, it uses a static approach to detect overreactions and then carries out hypothesis testing by means of a variety of statistical methods (both parametric and non-parametric) including ADF tests, Granger causality tests, correlation analysis, regression analysis with dummy variables, ARIMA and ARMAX models, neural net models, and VAR models. Specifically, the hypotheses tested are whether or not the frequency of overreactions (i) is informative about Bitcoin price movements (H1) and (ii) exhibits no seasonality (H2). On the whole, the results suggest that it can provide useful information to predict price dynamics in the cryptocurrency market and for designing trading strategies (H1 cannot be rejected), whilst there is no evidence of seasonality (H2 cannot be rejected).

TI Optical PUFs as physical root of trust for blockchain-driven
   applications
SO IET SOFTWARE
AB In an environment where cyber attacks are increasing, both in frequency and complexity, novel ways to shield data, users, and procedures have to be envisioned. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are the physical equivalent of one-way mathematical transformations with the exception that their inherent physical complexity renders them resilient to cloning. One interesting deployment scenario includes PUFs as random key generators. The deterministic nature of their operation alleviates the necessity to store the keys in non-volatile means. Along the same lines, blockchain is inherently resistant to modification of the data once stored while their overall security depends on the quality and secrecy of users' keys. Here, the authors propose a novel optical PUF implementation that can be combined with private blockchain modalities in order to cyber-harden Internet of things ecosystems. PUF-related experimental results are presented, alongside implementation scenarios.

TI Blockchain Technology and Financial Regulation: A Risk-Based Approach to
   the Regulation of ICOs
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB This paper compares Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and equity crowdfunding with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and explores the corresponding risks and limitations of these different fundraising practices, with a view to analysing the extent to which the latter should be subject to the same regulatory framework as the former. After assessing the underlying principles and current regulatory framework for IPOs and equity crowdfunding, with a focus on Europe and the US, we investigate the possibility of applying existing financial regulations to ICOs. Drawing from the notion of "functional equivalence", we contend that many ICOs share a sufficient number of similarities with traditional IPOs and equity crowdfunding, to be regulated in a similar manner. However, given the various attempts by token issuers to escape from the scope of securities laws by assigning a different function to their ICOs tokens, we argue that principle-based regulation based on an in-depth risk-analysis could be an effective way of addressing the regulation of ICOs, thereby moving from "functional equivalence" to "risk equivalence". Finally, we explore the use of blockchain technology as a regulatory technology, incorporating specific rules and constraints into the technological fabric of an ICO, in order to ensure compliance with the fundamental principles of financial regulation.

TI Swarm Economy: A Model for Transactions in a Distributed and Organic IoT
   Platform
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is steadily growing and migrating to decentralized architectures. In this context the Swarm approach, based on organic, edge-centric IoT networks, proposes one step further toward cooperation among devices, through the creation of a communication mediator called Swarm Broker. An important aspect in creating a cooperation network in the Swarm is the economical domain: the Swarm economy that guarantees fair rules to stimulate resource sharing among participants. This economic aspect is even more challenging in networks with distributed governance and motivates the adoption of a technology for a trustworthy and immutable public registry, such as blockchain, to store transaction information. In this paper, we aim to create an economic model that regulate the cooperation among the participants of the Swarm, by implementing strategies, to fulfill the restrictions posed by the decentralized network and the presence of resource-constrained devices that integrate the Swarm. We created a microeconomic model for resource sharing in the Swarm and a transaction model, based on the price and reputation of participants. We created a blockchain-based system for storing currency, contract, and reputation information in a distributed way. We included the resulting models and implementation into the Swarm network, by adding a module into the Swarm Broker.

TI Privacy Protection for Blockchains with Account and Multi-Asset Model
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB The blockchain technology has been applied to wide areas. However, the open and transparent properties of the blockchains pose serious challenges to users' privacy. Among all the schemes for the privacy protection, the zero-knowledge proof algorithm conceals most of the private information in a transaction, while participants of the blockchain can validate this transaction without the private information. However, current schemes are only aimed at blockchains with the UTXO model, and only one type of assets circulates on these blockchains. Based on the zero-knowledge proof algorithm, this paper proposes a privacy protection scheme for blockchains that use the account and multi-asset model. We design the transaction structure, anonymous addresses and anonymous asset metadata, and also propose the methods of the asset transfer and double-spending detection. The zk-SNARKs algorithm is used to generate and to verify the zero-knowledge proof. And finally, we conduct the experiments to evaluate our scheme.

TI How to Make Sure My Cryptokitties Are Here Forever? The Complementary
   Roles of Blockchain and the Law to Bring Trust
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB Under the phrase "code is law" and based on its "trustless trust", blockchain has emerged as a disrupting technology considered by some as an alternative to the law. Based on a study of real-life blockchain-based decentralised applications (Dapps), this article takes blockchain developers at their word and adopts the point of view of users: can blockchain live up to its promise and enable them to transact with each other without the need for the trust granted by the law? The article particularly highlights that users need to be able to ascertain that a self-advertised Dapp indeed qualifies as one. Blockchain technology may make it possible to do away with trust in third parties, but this is not enough. Users also need to trust that an alleged Dapp genuinely is one, and blockchain alone cannot provide this. Beyond Dapps, it is argued that blockchain needs the complementary role of the law to deliver its promises and especially to authenticate blockchain "virtues". The EU certification mark is identified as a promising form of co-regulation for that purpose.

Here we introduce and describe a blockchain based platform for decentralized scholarly communication. The design of the platform rests on community driven publishing reviewing processes and implements cryptoeconomic incentives that promote cooperative user behavior. The key to achieve cooperation in blockchain based scholarly communication is to transform today's static research paper into a modifiable research paper under continuous peer review process.

AB Our study on smart contracts, self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology, can be placed in the field of inquiry within law and economics of contracts which explores new modes of contract enforcement as sources of market creation. We lay the foundations by characterising contract enforcement and trust mechanisms underlying contracts. Considering that trust reduces risks in economic exchange, we explain how the particular trust mechanism underlying smart contracts' enforcement (no-party trust) provides opportunities for creating new markets and changing existing ones. We explore, among other things, whether using smart contracts could be a path to increasing the autonomy of consumers and offering a solution for democratising trade.

TI Beyond Bitcoin: A Statistical Comparison of Leading Cryptocurrencies and
   Fiat Currencies and Their Impact on Portfolio Diversification
SO JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
AB Cryptocurrencies have developed very dynamically although their future role is yet unclear. In any event, they are too big to ignore. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the understanding of cryptocurrencies in an individual and in a portfolio context. The study is based on daily closing prices of leading cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Dash) and fiat currencies (EUR, GBP, CHF, CAD, and JPY), all measured against USD. The analysis is threefold: First, the authors analyze basic statistical properties, such as correlation and autocorrelation of returns. Second, they perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS test) and a variance ratio test (VRT) with heteroscedasticity adjustment. Third, they solve more than 4,800 optimization problems to analyze the impact of individual crypto- and fiat currencies on portfolio diversification. Among other findings, the authors find that Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, CAD, JPY, and EUR contribute most to reduce the variance of a mixed portfolio. In a portfolio consisting of cryptocurrencies only, Bitcoin and Ripple have the largest diversification effect. The findings provide insights for investors who focus on minimum variance portfolios or, more generally, for investors who seek to reduce return volatility exposure, as well as for monetary authorities, cryptocurrency issuers, and providers of market infrastructure.

TI A Single Coin Monetary Mechanism for Distributed Cooperative
   Interference Management
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS
AB We present an example, where a distributed coordinated protocol supported by a simple monetary mechanism leads to achieving optimal information theoretic degrees of freedom gains. The considered setting is that of a linear interference network, where cooperative transmission is allowed, but at no cost in terms of the overall backhaul load. We show that a simple monetary mechanism that consists only of one coin type can enable the achievability of the optimal centralized solution. The proposed greedy distributed algorithm relies on incentivizing the users to share their resources in one channel use, in return of credit they receive for maximizing their rate gains in future channel uses. This example is the first in its class and it opens the door for constructing a unified framework for monetary mechanisms for optimal interference management and spectrum sharing. This problem carries the promise of a significant impact as blockchain techniques open the door for implementing such mechanisms in practice.

TI Decentralized bottom-up energy trading using Ethereum as a platform
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY MARKETS
AB In the past decade, there has been a significant increase in distributed energy resources. This transformation has rendered the grid more bidirectional and transformed many small consumers into prosumers. However, these small power producers are not able to optimize their revenue since, currently, they can only sell to local energy suppliers or opt to sell at a fixed feed-in tariff. If intermediaries are eliminated from energy trading, both individual buyers and prosumers can increase their profitability. Blockchain technology could facilitate this scenario. In this paper, the simulated environment of a hierarchical energy trading market using Ethereum's smart-contract technology is created as a proof-of-concept of using blockchain technology in energy trading. A dynamic grid fee based on electrical network loading is calculated to demonstrate an economic incentive for agents to have flexible load demand as well as to promote local resource utilization. The price volatility of cryptocurrency is addressed by designing a specific energy token for the model.

TI MCS-Chain: Decentralized and trustworthy mobile crowdsourcing based on
   blockchain
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Mobile Crowdsourcing (MCS) is an effective and novel method of data collection and processing. Current MCS generally adopts a centralized architecture by depending on an assumed trusted party. This design easily suffers from single-point failure and cannot be realized in practice since a trusted service provider does not really exist. More dangerously, the centralized party may perform dishonestly and thus harms the benefit and privacy of MCS users. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel blockchain-based MCS system, named MCS-Chain, to realize fully distributed and decentralized trust management in MCS. Aiming at improving the poor efficiency of traditional blockchain technology, we propose a novel consensus mechanism for block generation, which greatly reduces computational overhead. The proposed MCS-Chain system also solves the fork issue and centralization problem suffered by most existing blockchain-based systems. Serious security analysis and experimental evaluation further illustrate the security and efficiency of our system. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Does market attention affect Bitcoin returns and volatility?
SO DECISIONS IN ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB In this paper, we analyze the relative impact of attention measures either on the mean or on the variance of Bitcoin returns by fitting nonlinear econometric models to historical data: Two non-overlapping subsamples are considered from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017. Outcomes confirm that market attention has an impact on Bitcoin returns and volatility, when measured by applying several transformations on time series for the trading volume or the SVI Google searches index. Specifically, best candidate models are selected via the so-called Box-Jenkins methodology and by maximizing out-of-sample forecasting performance. Overall, we can conclude that trading volume-related measures affect both the mean and the volatility of the cryptocurrency returns, while Internet searches volume mainly affects the volatility. An interesting side finding is that the inclusion of attention measures in model specification makes forecast estimates more accurate.

TI Investments in Cryptocurrencies: Handle with Care!
SO JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
AB Asset pricing models and investment styles have been researched intensively in equities, bonds, FX, and commodities. However, a new asset class has emerged since the end of 2008, namely, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, among others. The author uses an extensive data set of over 1,500 cryptocurrencies and shows that almost none of the traditional investment styles such as momentum or defensive appear to be successful in this young asset class. Cryptocurrencies are also independent from the macroeconomic environment and cannot be explained by a standard asset pricing model. A cryptocurrency specific model yields clearly better results. In addition, the whole cryptocurrency space is dominated by only a few individual digital coins. Equally weighted mean monthly returns appear to be random with low or even no correlation with traditional asset classes such as US equities and global FX.

TI FRAUD RISK ASSESSMENT WITHIN BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS
SO ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY
AB The probability of successfully spending twice the same bitcoins is considered. A double-spending attack consists in issuing two transactions transferring the same bitcoins. The first transaction, from the fraudster to a merchant, is included in a block of the public chain. The second transaction, from the fraudster to himself, is recorded in a block that integrates a private chain, exact copy of the public chain up to substituting the fraudster-to-merchant transaction by the fraudster-to-fraudster transaction. The double-spending hack is completed once the private chain reaches the length of the public chain, in which case it replaces it. The growth of both chains are modelled by two independent counting processes. The probability distribution of the time at which the malicious chain catches up with the honest chain, or, equivalently, the time at which the two counting processes meet each other, is studied. The merchant is supposed to await the discovery of a given number of blocks after the one containing the transaction before delivering the goods. This grants a head start to the honest chain in the race against the dishonest chain.

TI Trust Access Authentication in Vehicular Network Based on Blockchain
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB Data sharing and privacy securing present extensive opportunities and challenges in vehicular network. This paper introduces 'trust access authentication scheme' as a mechanism to achieve real-time monitoring and promote collaborative sharing for vehicles. Blockchain, which can provide secure authentication and protected privacy, is a crucial technology. However, traditional cloud computing performs poorly in supplying low-latency and fast-response services for moving vehicles. In this situation, edge computing enabled Blockchain network appeals to be a promising method, where moving vehicles can access storage or computing resource and get authenticated from Blockchain edge nodes directly. In this paper, a hierarchical architecture is proposed consist of vehicular network layer, Blockchain edge layer and Blockchain network layer. Through a authentication mechanism adopting digital signature algorithm, it achieves trusted authentication and ensures valid verification. Moreover, a caching scheme based on many-to-many matching is proposed to minimize average delivery delay of vehicles. Simulation results prove that the proposed caching scheme has a better performance than existing schemes based on centralized model or edge caching strategy in terms of hit ratio and average delay.

TI Introducing Multi Shippers Mechanism for Decentralized Cash on Delivery
   System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB One of the major problems of e-commerce globally is the selling and buying of goods among the parties over the Internet in which the traders may not trust their partners. Cash on delivery allows customers to pay in cash when the product is delivered to their home or a location they choose. This is sometimes called a payment system because customers receive goods before making a payment. This paper investigates a critical verification process issue in the cash on delivery system. In particular, we propose a multi shippers mechanism, which consists of blockchain technology, smart contracts and hyperledger fabric platform to achieve distributed and trustworthy verification across participants in the decentralized markets. Our proposed mechanism is given to not only ensure the benefits of the seller but also prevent shipper's fraudulent. The solution leverages the consistency and robustness of decentralized markets where trust is flexible and effectively controlled. To demonstrate the application and implementation of the proposed framework, we conduct several case studies on real-world transaction datasets from a local computer retailer. We also provide our sources codes for further reproducibility and development. Our conclusion is that the continued integration of multi-shipper mechanism and blockchain technology in the decentralized markets will cause significant transformations across several disciplines.

TI Bitcoin Price Anomalies: Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Trading on LocalBitcoins
SO JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
AB The authors study trading behavior on Local Bitcoins, an alternative platform to conventional exchanges that allow investors all over the world to trade Bitcoin on a peer-to-peer basis. In particular, the authors examine the anomalous trade prices on Local Bitcoins, which are settled at values significantly different from market prices. As Local Bitcoins is not regulated in the way some exchanges are regulated, the persistence of the anomalous prices suggests that traders may be able to take advantage of the phenomenon to make substantial gains.

TI Building Redactable Consortium Blockchain for Industrial
   Internet-of-Things
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Applying consortium blockchain as a trust layer for heterogeneous industrial Internet-of-Things devices is cost-effective. However, with an increase in computing power, some powerful attacks (e.g., the 51% attack) are inevitable and will cause severe consequences. Recent studies also confirm that anonymity and immutability of blockchain have been abused to facilitate black market trades, etc. To operate controllable blockchain for IIoT devices, it is necessary to rewrite blockchain history back to a normal state once the chain is breached. Ateniese et al. proposed redactable blockchain by using chameleon hash (CH) to replace traditional hash function, it allows blockchain history to be written when needed (EuroS&P 2017). However, we cannot apply this idea directly to IIoT without solving the following problems: (1) achieve a decentralized design of CH; (2) update the signatures accordingly to authenticate the redacted contents; (3) satisfy the low-computing need of the individual IIoT device. In this paper, we overcome the above issues by proposing the first threshold chameleon hash (TCH) and accountable-and-sanitizable chameleon signature (ASCS) schemes. Based on them, we build a redactable consortium blockchain which is efficient for IIoT devices to operate. It allows a group of authorized sensors to write and rewrite blockchain without causing any hard forks. Basically, TCH is the first TCH and ASCS is a public-key signature supporting file-level and block-level modifications of signatures without impairing authentications. Additionally, ASCS achieves accountability to avoid abuse of redaction. While security analysis validates our proposals, the simulation results show that redaction is acceptably efficient if it is executed at a small scale or if we adopt a coarse-grained redaction while sacrificing some securities.

TI The Blockchain Consensus Algorithm for Viable Management of New and
   Renewable Energies
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Efficient information flow in an intelligent system is vital for effectively controlling the entire system. Currently, intelligent systems are used in many industries related to energy production, sustainable agriculture/transport, and intelligent building/cities. Information technology (IT) and information and communication technologies (ICT) play vital roles in introducing technical or technological innovation in these industries as well as establishing a collaborative network. Also, the digitization of existing systems has been quite effective at creating a sustainable global environment as it allows more efficient and well-balanced control of socio-economic factors. However, it has become clear that adopting an intelligent system to achieve innovation, sustainability, and safety may well depend on the quality of the algorithms to be used for that very system. Despite recent controversies, new and renewable energies are considered as a realistic alternative to fossil fuels, which have been integral to modern industries but are regarded as a cause of environmental or economic problems, not to mention their limited deposits. Therefore, since renewable energies will gradually replace existing energy sources but require more time to be fully available, it is essential to find a method of managing them in a fair and transparent way. The United States, Japan, and some European countries are attempting to achieve such a goal by utilizing a blockchain system, but the issues pertaining to its functionality, security, or efficiency have yet to be addressed. This study introduces a viable consensus algorithm (Hyper Delegation Proof of Randomness, or HDPoR algorithm) for blockchain and attempts to validate its parallel computing capability through simulations. This study also attempts to design an efficient but secure peer-to-peer (P2P) transaction service model for these energies for the future where blockchain-based systems will hold a key position in the digitalized world. As its main contribution, this study introduces an effective method of applying blockchain to a new and renewable energy transaction system by presenting a consensus algorithm that can improve its infrastructure and performance.

TI Enabling IC Traceability via Blockchain Pegged to Embedded PUF
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB Globalization of IC supply chain has increased the risk of counterfeit, tampered, and re-packaged chips in the market. Counterfeit electronics poses a security risk in safety critical applications like avionics, SCADA systems, and defense. It also affects the reputation of legitimate suppliers and causes financial losses. Hence, it becomes necessary to develop traceability solutions to ensure the integrity of supply chain, from the time of fabrication to the end of product-life, which allows a customer to verify the provenance of a device or a system. In this article, we present an IC traceability solution based on blockchain. A blockchain is a public immutable database that maintains a continuously growing list of data records secured from tampering and revision. Over the lifetime of an IC, all ownership transfer information is recorded and archived in a blockchain. This safe, verifiable method prevents any party from altering or challenging the legitimacy of the information being exchanged. However, a chain of sales record is not enough to ensure provenance of an IC. There is a need for clone-proof method for securely binding the identity of an IC to the blockchain information. In this article, we propose a method of IC supply chain traceability via blockchain pegged to embedded physically unclonable function (PUF). The blockchain provides ownership transfer record, while the PUF provides unique identification for an IC allowing it to be linked uniquely to a blockchain. Our proposed solution automates hardware and software protocols using blockchain-powered Smart Contract that allows supply chain participants to authenticate, track, trace, analyze, and provision chips throughout their entire life cycle.

TI Analyzing outliers activity from the time-series transaction pattern of
   bitcoin blockchain
SO EVOLUTIONARY AND INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS REVIEW
AB In a closed economic system like blockchain, the total amount of generated cryptocurrency called bitcoin is conserved and the transaction patterns demonstrate an insight of money flow inside the blockchain. For the last 2years, bitcoin market has grabbed an immense attention from the investors, technology entrepreneurs and currency enthusiasts. In this paper, we have come up with some findings in our investigation about the bitcoin time-series transaction patterns. We have graphically represented bitcoin's weekly patterns as a real economic currency that has been minted, stored and exchanged inside the bitcoin blockchain network. We identified outliers' activities with the help of descriptive statistical analysis. We also demonstrated transaction pattern behavioral change. The main implication of these findings is to understand some stylized facts of the time-series transaction of cryptocurrency-based fully digital financial system. Besides in our analysis, we have shown that the behavioral change of the transaction pattern is capable of explaining the system development events or major historical events that have a network impact.

SO HITOTSUBASHI JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB Although Bitcoin was designed as a payment vehicle and as a store of value, it seems unlikely that currencies provided by central banks are at risk of being replaced, primarily because of the market price instability of Bitcoin. We diagnose the instability as being a symptom of the lack of flexibility in the Bitcoin supply schedule - a predetermined algorithm in which the proof of work is the major driving force. This paper explores the problem of instability from the viewpoint of economics, and suggests a new monetary policy for stabilizing the values of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

TI Blockchain-Based Voting in the US and EU Constitutional Orders: A
   Digital Technology to Secure Democratic Values?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB The right to vote and participate in the political process is a quintessential feature of any democratic society. Systematic risks to the integrity of US elections and passive civic participation in the EU political process present fundamental threats to the constitutional aspirations and the democratic ideals connected to "We the People" in the US and "United in Diversity" in the EU. The existence of power imbalances, social inequalities and information asymmetries in electoral and political processes illustrate that both jurisdictions are in peril and in risk of democratic backsliding. Blockchain-based voting can transform existing electoral and political processes in the digital age. This raises the question whether blockchain-based voting can be utilised as a digital tool to enhance the democratic legitimacy of US and EU electoral and political systems. Accordingly, this article aims to examine the prospects and limits of blockchain technology to secure foundational democratic norms connected to the right to vote and civic participation at the heart of contemporary constitutionalism. It contends that the decentralised, immutable, accessible, transparent, and secure processes of blockchain technology have the potential to enhance the legitimacy of the US and EU constitutional orders, since blockchain-based voting can act as a forum for enhanced civic participation, public deliberation, and democratic contestation. Nevertheless, the article concludes that a number of important steps must be taken to fully realise the potential of blockchain-based voting in a manner that combats the risks associated with the technology, strengthens public confidence in electoral and political processes and secures a balanced system of governance in the US and the EU constitutional orders.

TI Enhancement of Mechanical Properties of Cork Through Thermal
   High-Temperature Treatment (THT) and Boiling
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB The ecological treatment of cork, at high temperature brings about some changes in its mechanical and chemical properties, which make cork a new material with different types of performance (thermal, mass, acoustic and vibratory). For this purpose, our study focuses on determining the optimal thermal cycle by using TGA and IR analyses. In terms of mass insulation, the calculation of the diffusion coefficient, which is a potential indicator of cork improvement, is carried out using new experimental protocols that consist of high-temperature treatment (THT) in addition to boiling. The obtained results show that the lowest value of the apparent diffusion coefficient of cork (Dapp) is reached when the thermal high-temperature treatment (THT) is preceded by boiling and when the heat rate is 0.5C/mn. The average value of Dapp is determined through the calibration of theoretical model with the experimental data collected by utilising conductimetric measures. Using the Bat-Algorithm, the Dapp is determined accurately with a relative error of 10-7. Furthermore, the Dapp value is affected by the heat rate during the treatment cycle.

TI HealthyBroker: A Trustworthy Blockchain-Based Multi-Cloud Broker for
   Patient-Centered eHealth Services
SO ELECTRONICS
AB Delivering electronic health care (eHealth) services across multi-cloud providers to implement patient-centric care demands a trustworthy brokering architecture. Specifically, such an architecture should aggregate relevant medical information to allow informed decision-making. It should also ensure that this information is complete and authentic and that no one has tampered with it. Brokers deployed in eHealth services may fall short of meeting such criteria due to two key behaviors. The first involves violating international health-data protection laws by allowing user anonymity and limiting user access rights. Second, brokers claiming to provide trustworthy transactions between interested parties usually rely on user feedback, an approach vulnerable to manipulation by malicious users. This paper addresses these data security and trust challenges by proposing HealthyBroker, a novel, trust-building brokering architecture for multiple cloud environments. This architecture is designed specifically for patient-centric cloud eHealth services. It enables care-team members to complete eHealth transactions securely and access relevant patient data on a need-to-know basis in compliance with data-protection laws. HealthyBroker also protects against potential malicious behavior by assessing the trust relationship and tracking it using a neutral, tamper-proof, distributed blockchain ledger. Trust is assessed based on two strategies. First, all transactions and user feedback are tracked and audited in a distributed ledger for transparency. Second, only feedback coming from trustworthy parties is taken into consideration. HealthyBroker was tested in a simulated eHealth multi-cloud environment. The test produced better results than a benchmark algorithm in terms of data accuracy, service time, and the reliability of feedback received as measured by three malicious behavior models (naive, feedback isolated, and feedback collective). These results demonstrate that HealthyBroker can provide care teams with a trustworthy, transparent ecosystem that can facilitate information sharing and well-informed decisions for patient-centric care.

TI Securing ICN-Based UAV Ad Hoc Networks with Blockchain
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Named data networking (NON) enables fast and efficient content dissemination in mission-critical unmanned aerial vehicle ad hoc networks (UAANETs); however, its in-network caching mechanism brings a new security challenge: content poisoning. Poisoned content can contaminate the cache on the routers and isolate valid content from the network, leading to performance degradation or denial of service. To mitigate such attacks and enhance network-layer trust of NON-based UAANETs, this article proposes a novel and systematic framework that integrates interest-key-content binding (IKCB), forwarding strategy, and on-demand verification to efficiently discover poisoned content. To further provide decentralized IKCB store and detect internal attackers, we introduce a lightweight permissioned blockchain system over NDN and develop a scalable adaptive delegate consensus algorithm. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed framework can effectively purge poisoned content with low overhead, and our algorithms achieve great performance to fit UAANETs.

TI A Blockchain-Based Data Life Cycle Protection Framework for
   Information-Centric Networks
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB Information-centric networking (ICN) supports efficient data provision and retrieval with in-network caching. The data life cycle over ICN includes atomic data collection, data publication, caching, and retrieval, suffering from various attacks, such as regulation violation and false claim. Existing solutions have not considered regulation compliance and typically focus on the protection of a specific procedure. To solve these problems, we propose a blockchain-based data life cycle protection framework (BDLP), which exploits the transaction and smart contract to provide a trusted and neutral environment in ICN. In BDLP, a special type of node, a data dam blockchain node, is designed to locally control registration and restrict data flow, besides the function of a blockchain node. BDLP consists of five types of transactions (RegT, CollectT, PubT, PayT, and PunT) to achieve accountability and four types of smart contracts (PubSC, PaySC, AccSC, and RepSC) to achieve authentication, regulation compliance, and neutrality. We elaborate on the data retrieval procedure in BDLP and analyze its scalability, demonstrating that BDLP can achieve a low data retrieval permission delay.

TI Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure: An economic perspective
SO ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS REVIEW
AB The aim of this article is to analyze the economic aspects of cybersecurity of critical infrastructure defined as physical or virtual systems and assets that are vital to a country's functioning and whose incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating impact on national, economic, military and public security. The functioning of modern states, firms and individuals increasingly relies on digital or cyber technologies and this trend has also materialized in various facets of critical infrastructure. Critical infrastructure presents a new cybersecurity area of attacks and threats that requires the attention of regulators and service providers. Deploying critical infrastructure systems without suitable cybersecurity might make them vulnerable to intrinsic failures or malicious attacks and result in serious negative consequences. In this article a fuller view of costs and losses associated with cyberattacks that includes both private and external (social) costs is proposed. An application of the cost-benefit analysis or the Return on Security Investment (ROSI) indicator is presented to evaluate the worthiness of cybersecurity efforts and analyze the costs associated with some major cyberattacks in recent years. The "Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover" (IPDRR) framework of organizing cybersecurity efforts is also proposed as well as an illustration as to how the blockchain technology could be utilized to improve security and efficiency within a critical infrastructure.

TI BLOCKCHAIN IN MANUFACTURING REVOLUTION BASED ON MACHINE TO MACHINE
   TRANSACTION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW
SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT
AB In the last few years, two technological events emerged. First, the rising of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies such as IoT allowed the direct link between machines on the shop floor, establishing a machine-to-machine communication (M2M). Second, block-chain enables transactions such payments and contracts without a formal reliable or accreditation institutions, such as banks or government.
   Goal: The goal of this paper is to explore the state-of-art of the blockchain technology applied to the manufacture sector. In this sense, the option of the M2M transaction being intermediated by blockchain on the shop floor is a hypothesis to be tested. Moreover, it could be questioned if these subjects are being appreciated by the academia.
   Design / Methodology / Approach: a systematic review of the literature was conducted, considering blockchain, the industrial context, and the Industry 4.0 related technologies.

TI Establishing the representational faithfulness of financial accounting
   information using multiparty security, network analysis and a blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB This paper aims to develop a design for an accounting information system that will enhance the representational faithfulness of financial reporting information. One of the functions of financial reporting is to aggregate and report the entity's private data. This paper shows that recognizing that some of the firm's private data is already shared with others allows the methods of multiparty security to be applied to the reporting and audit processes. We contend that using both public key cryptography and network analysis allows the identity of an entity to be modelled as a place on a network. We also develop accounting recordkeeping techniques to balance public access with privacy using a blockchain. Taken together, these three design ideas can enhance the representational faithfulness of financial reporting systems because they use shared data from independent entities, a transparent system, and open-access immutable storage. Faithful representation is enhanced because information from this system can be used by auditors to support their audit opinion or by stakeholders who need credible information about the entity.

TI TOWARDS THE APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY FOR IMPROVING TRADE
   FACILITATION IN CEFTA 2006
SO EKONOMSKA MISAO I PRAKSA-ECONOMIC THOUGHT AND PRACTICE
AB The benefits and value drivers of customs digitalization are considerable. The key motivation is the efficiency associated with minimizing the cost of managing documents throughout the trade process, including costs associated with the exchange of documents with other countries, as well as the procurement and facilitation of those documents. Since it is of general knowledge that effective trade facilitation signifies reliability and security of the trade transactions we think that blockchain technology may be able to offer a high level of confidence in these areas to both traders and regulators. The proposal presented in this paper is focused on jointly moving all (customs) stakeholders towards a standardized integration of collaborative processes. By investigating blockchain solutions along with technology and standards, we propose a pathway to achieving an international system-to-system integration. Taking into consideration the realization of deeper integration among the countries, especially in the field of trade and digital integration, we try to analyze how blockchain technology can help support that integration. In order to analyze the possible application of this technology for deepening CEFTA integration through enhancing trade facilitation we briefly refer to its' positive aspects. Instead of developing individual software solutions in CEFTA countries it might be beneficial to move services to a blockchain technology platform. While currently, this might be hindered by local policies, blockchain technology will have its' influence and application in trade facilitation as it has in many other fields. With full awareness of the possible threats and challenges, it is of the utmost importance to engage in discovering the most compatible pathway to apply this technology in regional trade facilitation and deepen digital integration among CEFTA member countries.

TI Blockchain and Building Information Modeling (BIM): Review and
   Applications in Post-Disaster Recovery
SO BUILDINGS
AB Blockchain Technology (BCT) is a growing digital technology that in recent years has gained widespread traction in various industries in the public and private sectors. BCT is a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a block', the body of which is comprised of encrypted data of the entire transaction history. BCT was introduced as the working mechanism that forms the operational basis of Bitcoin, the first digital cryptocurrency to gain mainstream appeal. The introduction of decentralized data exchange technology in any industry would require strengthened security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from current centralized architectures to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. BCT aims at creating a system that would offer a robust self-regulating, self-monitoring, and cyber-resilient data transaction operation, assuring the facilitation and protection of a truly efficient data exchange system. In the state of Florida, climate change and unpredicted weather disasters have put pressure on state and local decision-makers to adapt quick and efficient post-disaster recovery systems. Part of the recovery efforts is the reconstruction of buildings and infrastructure. The introduction of new technologies in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry can contribute to addressing recovery and rebuilding after the event of a natural disaster. With parallel technological advancement in geospatial data and Geographic Information System (GIS), as well as worsening climatic conditions, concerns can be suitably addressed by employing an integrated system of both Building Information Modeling (BIM) and BCT. While several potential applications of BIM must provide solutions to disaster-related issues, few have seen practical applications in recent years that indicate the potential benefits of such implementations. The feasibility of BIM-based applications still rests on the reliability of connectivity and cyber-security, indicating a strong use case for using BCT in conjunction with BIM for post-disaster recovery. This research depicts a survey of BCT and its applications in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industries and examines the potential incorporation within the BIM process to address post-disaster rebuilding problems. Moreover, the study investigates the potential application of BCT in improving the framework for automating the building permitting process using Smart Contract (SC) technologies and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), as well as discussing future research areas. The study proposes a new conceptualized framework resulting from the integration of BCT and BIM processes to improve the efficiency of building permit processes in post-disaster events.

TI Community energy retail tariffs in Singapore: opportunities for
   peer-to-peer and time-of-use versus vertically integrated tariffs
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY MARKETS
AB The deregulation of Singapore's retail electricity market in 2018 and the rapid adoption of solar rooftops have led to the emergence of a new type of energy transaction, wherein prosumers require flexible tariffs that reflect their willingness to respond to market price signals as well as new business models. The move toward community energy schemes, where prosumers can trade their surplus electricity locally, and the implications this has for tariff design motivates our study. We propose a portfolio of stylized retail tariffs for different market organizations. Among the proposed configurations are time-of-use (ToU), default vertical and peer-to-peer (P2P) tariffs, the last of which operates through a blockchain platform. In this study, each Singaporean district is balanced as a potential future microgrid. An iterative double-auction mechanism is designed to calculate a distributed P2P tariff, looking to maximize the benefit for stakeholders. This tariff is then cleared and compared with a bespoke retail ToU tariff as well as Singapore's monopolistic regulated vertical tariff.

TI The impact of blockchain technologies and smart contracts on dispute
   resolution: arbitration and court litigation at the crossroads
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
AB This article investigates the twofold impact that blockchain technologies and smart contracts have on dispute resolution. On the one hand, these technologies enable private parties to devise arbitral systems that are self-enforcing and, therefore, largely bypass the recognition and enforcement procedures through which State courts traditionally exert a certain control over arbitration. This phenomenon may in the future allow arbitration to become entirely self-sufficient, thus leading to the marginalization of State courts. On the other hand, however, such a marginalization has not taken place yet; to the contrary, the recent blockchain-related phenomenon of initial coin offerings has given rise to some prominent court cases. These cases raise particularly interesting jurisdictional questions, especially in light of the difficulty of reconciling the decentralized nature of the blockchain with the territorial approach whereby jurisdiction is typically allocated among national courts.

TI Distributed Algorithm for Making Scale-Free Network by Preferential
   Rewiring Without Growth
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB The digital payment system that uses crypto-currency, such as Bitcoin, is a distributed ledger working on a peer-to-peer network. We present a method to make a scale-free network for such applications. Using some biased physical quantities that are observable in sites, we can make the scale-free network through processes of cooperating distributed sites. Each node only proposes connecting to the more attractive node among randomly known nodes. The candidate node that is found by each node agrees to set two-way links if the requesting node is more attractive than the old node that is already connected. Once they establish the new bidirectional relationship, they, respectively, remove the outgoing link to the less attractive node. We analytically calculate the connectivity distribution and show that the scaling exponent is 2.5. By Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm that a power law distribution of the scaling exponent 2.5 describes the degree distribution of the topology.

TI Instantaneous Volatility Seasonality of High-Frequency Markets in
   Directional-Change Intrinsic Time
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB We propose a novel intraday instantaneous volatility measure which utilises sequences of drawdowns and drawups non-equidistantly spaced in physical time as indicators of high-frequency activity of financial markets. The sequences are re-expressed in terms of directional-change intrinsic time which ticks only when the price curve changes the direction of its trend by a given relative value. We employ the proposed measure to uncover weekly volatility seasonality patterns of three Forex and one Bitcoin exchange rates, as well as a stock market index. We demonstrate the long memory of instantaneous volatility computed in directional-change intrinsic time. The provided volatility estimation method can be adapted as a universal multiscale risk-management tool independent of the discreteness and the type of analysed high-frequency data.

TI Smart contracts for smart rural supply chains
SO BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
AB Rural economy is often associated with small firm size together with low level of business sophistication, thin business networks, limited ability to attract investments, regional orientation and weakness in entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, there are strong activities towards smart rural development by applying recent advances in information technology (IT) to foster new development paths of Europe's rural areas. A new and promising IT invention is related to blockchain technology and smart contracts, i.e. to computerized transaction protocols intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation and execution of the terms of an underlying legal contract designed to fulfil common contractual conditions comprising payments, legal obligations, and enforcement without third party. But the potential of smart contracts goes far beyond cost reductions by facilitating entrepreneurial collaboration of cross-organizational business-processes in the context of smart rural supply chains.
   An analysis of existing or ongoing smart contract projects reveals that the majority of smart-contract applications in business life are linked to industrial solutions. But a closer look to all successfully applied cases of blockchain technology and smart contracts also shows high potential for integrating fragmented rural supply and value chains towards smart rural development. Hence, one important development perspective lies in the use of digitalization approaches to overcome rural shortcomings in rural networks of small and medium enterprises (SME) and value chains by coordinating and optimizing their supply chains and to market their products in order to reduce or even avoid the dependency of multinational agricultural commodity traders.
   This paper discusses the research question how and to which extent smart contracting and blockchain technology can be applied to empower rural SME in smart rural supply chains. The research results will be empirically validated by two case studies from the area of smart supply chains in a rural context.

TI Approaching the Communication Constraints of Ethereum-Based
   Decentralized Applications
SO SENSORS
AB Those working on Blockchain technologies have described several new innovative directions and novel services in the Internet of things (IoT), including decentralized trust, trusted and verifiable execution of smart contracts, and machine-to-machine communications and automation that reach beyond the mere exchange of data. However, applying blockchain principles in the IoT is a challenge due to the constraints of the end devices. Because of fierce cost pressure, the hardware resources in these devices are usually reduced to the minimum necessary for operation. To achieve the high coverage needed, low bitrate mobile or wireless technologies are frequently applied, so the communication is often constrained, too. These constraints make the implementation of blockchain nodes for IoT as standalone end-devices impractical or even impossible. We therefore investigated possible design approaches to decentralized applications based on the Ethereum blockchain for the IoT. We proposed and evaluated three application architectures differing in communication, computation, storage, and security requirements. In a pilot setup we measured and analyzed the data traffic needed to run the blockchain clients and their applications. We found out that with the appropriate designs and the remote server architecture we can strongly reduce the storage and communication requirements imposed on devices, with predictable security implications. Periodic device traffic is reduced to 2400 B/s (HTTP) and 170 B/s (Websocket) from about 18 kB/s in the standalone-device full client architecture. A notification about a captured blockchain event and the corresponding verification resulted in about 2000 B of data. A transaction sent from the application to the client resulted in an about 500 B (HTTP) and 300 B message (Websocket). The key store location, which affects the serialization of a transaction, only had a small influence on the transaction-related data. Raw transaction messages were 45 B larger than when passing the JSON transaction objects. These findings provide directions for fog/cloud IoT application designers to avoid unrealistic expectations imposed upon their IoT devices and blockchain technologies, and enable them to select the appropriate system design according to the intended use case and system constraints. However, for very low bit-rate communication networks, new communication protocols for device to blockchain-client need to be considered.

TI Blockchain technology and the governance of foreign aid
SO JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS
AB Blockchain technology has been considered a vehicle to foster development in poor countries by promoting applications such as secure delivery of humanitarian aid, digital identity services, and proof of provenance. This article examines whether (and if so, how) blockchain technology can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of foreign aid governance, thereby moving beyond completely anonymous contexts. Foreign aid governance is plagued by lack of credible commitments among states, which are further exacerbated by information asymmetries and which often undermine aid effectiveness. In this context, blockchain technology holds two promises. First, through the guaranteed execution of smart contracts, it can strengthen the credibility of state commitments, for example collective burden-sharing rules among a group of donors or recipient country compliance with policy conditionality in return for aid. Second, through leveraging prediction markets, blockchain technology can allay information problems related to the verification of real-world events along the entire aid delivery chain.

SO DIGITAL EDUCATION REVIEW
AB Making universal access to education compatible with different paths of learning is one of the great challenges of the last century. Technology has provided solutions to access information, for communication and collaborative work. Blockchain emerges as a technology that can be useful for the development of an evaluation model of individualized learning itineraries in mass university subjects. In this line, the Edublocs project has been designed and executed, an initiative where these itineraries have been designed, incorporating elements of peer learning, team-teaching, PLEs, microlearning, technology-enhanced assessment...
   The objective of the Edublocs project is to design and implement a system of recording the results of activities through Blockchain that allow the student to follow a personal itinerary, and the teacher-tutor of the subject to carry out a formative evaluation and an accrediting appraisal of their work. The project is well underway in the evaluation of the implementation process.
   The experience with some elements of the design and the experimental execution in a formal university context during the present academic course, has allowed us to obtain important indications on the viability and relevance of the use of Blockchain in education. These, together with the explanation and justification of explaining the context of its applicability, will be laid out in the broad development of the article.

TI A Hierarchical and Abstraction-Based Blockchain Model
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB In the nine years since its launch, amid intense research, scalability is always a serious concern in blockchain, especially in case of large-scale network generating huge number of transaction-records. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain model characterized by: (1) each level maintains multiple local blockchain networks, (2) each local blockchain records local transactional activities, and (3) partial views (tunable w.r.t. precision) of different subsets of local blockchain-records are maintained in the blockchains at next level of the hierarchy. To meet this objective, we apply abstractions on a set of transaction-records in a regular time interval by following the Abstract Interpretation framework, which provides a tunable precision in various abstract domain and guarantees the soundness of the system. While this model suitably fits to the real-worlds organizational structures, the proposal is powerful enough to scale when large number of nodes participate in a network resulting into an enormous growth of the network-size and the number of transaction-records. We discuss experimental results on a small-scale network with three sub networks at lower-level and by abstracting the transaction-records in the abstract domain of intervals. The results are encouraging and clearly indicate the effectiveness of this approach to control exponential growth of blockchain size w.r.t. the total number of participants in the network.

Cryptocurrencies' returns are compared to six major stock indices: two American (S&P500 and Russell 2000), one European (Stoxx 600), one Japanese (Nikkei 225), one Chinese (Hong Kong Hang Seng) and a global index (S&P Global 1200). The findings indicate that observed cryptocurrencies could be regarded as a new asset class, a fully digital, sui-generis financial instruments, as they are not coherently connected to the stock market. However, allocating capital into cryptocurrencies remains in the domain of pure speculation due to their strong volatility.

TI The Role of Smart Contracts in Sustainability: Worldwide Research Trends
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The advent and development of digital technologies has had a significant impact on the establishment of contracts. Smart contracts are designed as computer code containing instructions for executing user agreements, offering a technologically secure solution with numerous advantages and applications. However, smart contracts are not without their problems when we try to fit them into the traditional system of contract law, and their presumed benefits can become shortcomings. Bibliometric studies can help to assess the current state of science in a specific subject and support decision making and research direction. Here, this bibliometric study is used to analyze global trend research in relation to this novel contractual methodology, the smart contract, which seems to have experienced exponential growth since 2014. Specially, this analysis was focused on the main countries involved and the institutions that lead this research worldwide. On the other hand, the indexations of these works are analyzed according to major scientific areas and the keywords of all the works, to detect the subjects to which they are grouped. Community detection has been used to establish the relationship between countries researching in this area, and six clusters have been identified, around which all the work related to this topic is grouped. This work shows the temporal evolution of research related to smart contracts, highlighting that there are two trendse-commerce and smart power grids. From the perspective of driving sustainability, smart contracts could provide a contribution in the near future.

TI National currency, world currency, cryptocurrency: A Fichtean approach
   to the Ethics of Bitcoin
SO BUSINESS AND SOCIETY REVIEW
AB I investigate ethical questions concerning a novel cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, using a Fichtean account of the ethics of currency. Fichte holds that currencies should fulfill an ethical purpose: providing access, in perpetuity, to the material welfare that underwrites citizens' basic rights. In his nineteenth-century context, Fichte argues that currencies fulfill this purpose better when nations control them (i.e., when they are "national currencies") than when foreigners freely trade them (as "world currencies"). After exploring conditions in which national currencies fail to secure material stability over time, e.g., in corrupt regimes, I develop a Fichtean model for ethically evaluating currencies and evaluate the extent to which Bitcoin meets its standards for ethical currency. I argue that Bitcoin undermines the (monetary) power of nations and, as such, threatens their ability to provide access to necessary material goods. While offering citizens a means of defending themselves against corrupt regimes, Bitcoin forsakes the general welfare and is, as such, unethical by Fichtean lights.

To this end, we employ market prices of the largest cryptocurrencies for a period extending from August of 2015 through February of 2018. Results derived from the standard testing procedure using ordinary least squares pointed to the existence of herding behavior in the cryptocurrencies' market. Evidence on herding effects are further corroborated employing a quantile regression that accounts for the asymmetric nature of cryptocurrencies' returns. However, herding behavior is no longer present when a more robust time-varying regression model is employed. Our results entail significant implications for researchers, investors and market authorities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The impact of technology on access to law and the concomitant
   repercussions: past, present, and the future (from the 1980s to present
   time)
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
AB That technology increasingly impacts everything that is linked to law-from access to law, legal education, the services provided by the legal industry, and, increasingly, even adjudication (in-court or via alternative dispute resolution)-is a fact. The role that technology plays in these contexts varies, yet one may safely presume that the influence will intensify. In order to reflect on the future, this article canvasses and tries to draw some conclusions based on the comparison of accessibility to foreign and local law in the hard copy versus the digital and Internet-based, as well as the recently unfolding era of algorithms. The examples range from the curious encounter of Central and Eastern European socialist enterprises and law students with punitive damages and strict tortious liability known in the USA through the most recent launching of the first transnational letter of credit transaction exploiting blockchain technology. The advancements generated by technology advancements in these three stages are then reflected upon primarily from the perspectives of (i) researchers and lecturers of law as well as legal education; (ii) company boards and managements (especially foreign market-oriented business firms) formulating their business policies; and (iii) regulators as well as law and policymakers. The article concludes with thoughts on the broader implications of enhanced access to law. In particular, it posits that technology has made the shift from 'mechanical' to 'analytic access to law' possible. Yet it also raises the more fundamental question of whether the advancements denote, and the selected examples properly illustrate, that a more fundamental shift is unfolding: a shift from governance by law to governance by technology?

TI In pursuit of good governance for the energy industry blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF ENERGY MARKETS
AB This paper interprets the principles of good governance and corporate governance in the context of distributed ledger technologies, namely blockchain, analyzing specifically how these principles apply to a blockchain-enabled energy market. With blockchain, governance becomes decentralized and automated, creating a new, technical bureaucracy. However, a programmed decision tree does not inevitably produce a digitized democracy and a functional marketplace. While blockchain governance decisions have been predominantly technical, they increasingly embroil legal, moral, cultural and even philosophical considerations. As a result, governance is increasingly recognized as a critical challenge in the future development of blockchain-enabled marketplaces. Future, multidisciplinary research by lawyers, engineers, political scientists and philosophers should venture further into developing good governance principles for blockchain, focusing on equity and inclusion.

TI Design of a software architecture supporting business-to-government
   information sharing to improve public safety and security: Combining
   business rules, Events and blockchain technology
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB To ensure public safety and security, it is vitally important for governments to collect information from businesses and analyse it. Such information can be used to determine whether transported goods might be suspicious and therefore require physical inspection. Although businesses are obliged to report some information, they are reluctant to share additional information for fear of sharing competitively sensitive information, becoming liable and not being compliant with the law. These reasons are often overlooked in the design of software architectures for information sharing. In the present research, we followed a design science approach to develop a software architecture for business-to-government information sharing. Based on literature and a case study, we elicited the requirements an architecture that provides for the sharing of information should meet to make it acceptable to businesses. We then developed the architecture and evaluated it against the requirements. The architecture consists of a blockchain that stores events and rules for information sharing that are controlled by businesses. For each event, two parties use their private keys to encrypt its Merkle root to confirm that they know the data are correct. This makes it easy to check whether information is reliable and whether an event should be accepted. Access control, metadata and context information enable the context-based sharing of information. This is combined with the encryption and decryption of data to provide access to certain data within an organisation.

Afterwards, we enhanced our Turtle-based trading system with additional conditions for opening a new position. Specifically, we added an exclusion zone based on the ATR indicator, in order to have controlled conditions for opening a new position after a stop loss signal was triggered. Thus, AdTurtle was developed, a Turtle trading system with advanced algorithms of opening and closing positions. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time this variation of the Turtle trading system has been developed and examined.

TI Proof-of-work blockchains and settlement finality: a functional
   interpretation
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
AB In this paper, we aim to provide an interpretation of the legal issue of settlement finality in the context of proof-of-work distributed ledger technology, such as the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin intends to achieve certainty of settlement of its cryptocurrency in a trustless environment, without the need for intermediaries and without recourse to any legal provision. We extend earlier work on functional modeling of the theoretical settlement problem to include blockchains, and we provide a functional interpretation of settlement finality by introducing the notion of degree of settlement finality. In principle, we conclude that functional settlement finality in Bitcoin is preferred to legal enforceability. However, in practice, the Bitcoin blockchain is not suitable for the trusted environment of the regulated financial industry unless well-known issues - such as high energy consumption, low settlement speed, problems with scalability and the 51% attack risk - are resolved.

TI A Blockchain Based Mobile Crowdsensing Market
SO CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
AB Mobile crowdsensing(MCS) is an emerging pattern which means task initiators attract mobile users sensing with their own devices by some platforms. MCS could exploit idle resources in low cost, while it has lots of flaws, which impede its developments. First, isolations between different MCS systems leads to wastage of social resources. What's more, current MCS always operate in a centralized way, which causes it vulnerable and unbelievable. Blockchain is a promising technology which could supply a credible and transparent environment. This paper construct a blockchain based MCS market and design smart contract for its operation. In our design, platform breaks isolation by blockchain, task initiators and mobile users manage their tasks by smart contract and bargain price with distributed algorithm. By this way, resource could be exploited better, and the market could be more fair. What's more, the paper analyzes Walrasian Equilibrium (WE) in the market, and details how to deploy MCS in blockchain. Evalution results shows that Equilibrium could be found.

SO SAIEE AFRICA RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB This paper examines the way in which blockchain technology can be used to improve the verification of integrity of evidence in digital forensics. Some background into digital forensic practices and blockchain technology are discussed to provide necessary context. A particular scalable method of verifying point-in-time existence of a piece of digital evidence, using the OpenTimestamps (OTS) service, is described, and tests are carried out to independently validate the claims made by the service. The results demonstrate that the OTS service is highly reliable with a zero false positive and false negative error rate for timestamp attestations, but that it is not suitable for time-sensitive timestamping due to the variance of the accuracy of timestamps induced by block confirmation times in the Bitcoin blockchain.

TI On the Application of Blockchains to Spectrum Management
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB Spectrum sharing mechanisms have evolved to meet different needs related to increasing spectrum use efficiency. At first, decentralized and opportunistic cognitive radios (and cognitive radio networks) were the primary focus of research for these mechanisms. This gradually transitioned toward the development of cooperative sharing methods based on databases, typified by TV white spaces databases. Spectrum sharing is now the basis for the dynamic and fine-grained spectrum rights regime for the citizen's band radio service (CBRS) as well as for license shared access (LSA). The emergence of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin has stimulated interest in applying its underlying technology, blockchain, to other applications as well, such as securities trading and supply chain management. This paper explores the application of blockchain to radio spectrum management. While blockchains could underlie radio spectrum management more broadly, we will focus on dynamic spectrum sharing applications. Like the cooperative approaches currently in use, blockchain is a database technology. However, a blockchain is a decentralized database in which the owner of the data maintains control. We consider the benefits and limitations of blockchain solutions in general, and then examine their potential application to four major categories of spectrum sharing.

TI Electronics Supply Chain Integrity Enabled by Blockchain
SO ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
AB Electronic systems are ubiquitous today, playing an irreplaceable role in our personal lives, as well as in critical infrastructures such as power grids, satellite communications, and public transportation. In the past few decades, the security of software running on these systems has received significant attention. However, hardware has been assumed to be trustworthy and reliable "by default" without really analyzing the vulnerabilities in the electronics supply chain. With the rapid globalization of the semiconductor industry, it has become challenging to ensure the integrity and security of hardware. In this article, we discuss the integrity concerns associated with a globalized electronics supply chain. More specifically, we divide the supply chain into six distinct entities: IP owner/foundry (OCM), distributor, assembler, integrator, end user, and electronics recycler, and analyze the vulnerabilities and threats associated with each stage. To address the concerns of the supply chain integrity, we propose a blockchain-based certificate authority framework that can be used to manage critical chip information such as electronic chip identification, chip grade, and transaction time. The decentralized nature of the proposed framework can mitigate most threats of the electronics supply chain, such as recycling, remarking, cloning, and overproduction.

TI Why do Public Blockchains Need Formal and Effective Internal Governance
   Mechanisms?
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF RISK REGULATION
AB With the birth and rise of cryptocurrencies following the success of Bitcoin and the popularity of "Initial Coin Offerings", public awareness of blockchain technologies has substantially increased in recent years. Many blockchain advocates claim that these software artefacts enable radically new forms of decentralised governance by relying upon computational trust created via cryptographic proof, obviating the need for reliance on conventional trusted third-party intermediaries. But these claims rest on some key assumptions, which this paper subjects to critical examination. It asks: can existing mechanisms and procedures for collective decision-making of public blockchains (which we refer to as internal blockchain governance) live up to these ambitions? By drawing upon HLA Hart's Concept of Law, together with literature from regulatory governance studies, we argue that unless public blockchain systems establish formal and effective internal governance, they are unlikely to be taken up at scale as a tool for social coordination, and are thus likely to remain, at best, a marginal technology.

TI Frameup: An incriminatory attack on Storj: A peer to peer blockchain
   enabled distributed storage system
SO DIGITAL INVESTIGATION
AB In this work we present a primary account of frameup, an incriminatory attack made possible because of existing implementations in distributed peer to peer storage. The frameup attack shows that an adversary has the ability to store unencrypted data on the hard drives of people renting out their hard drive space. This is important to forensic examiners as it opens the door for possibly framing an innocent victim. Our work employs Storj as an example technology, due to its popularity and market size. Storj is a blockchain enabled system that allows people to rent out their hard drive space to other users around the world by employing a cryptocurrency token that is used to pay for the services rendered. It uses blockchain features like a transaction ledger, public/private key encryption, and cryptographic hash functions - but this work is not centered around blockchain. Our work discusses two frameup attacks, a preliminary and an optimized attack, both of which take advantage of Storj's implementation. Results illustrate that Storj allows a potential adversary to store incriminating unencrypted files, or parts of files that are viewable on people's systems when renting out their unused hard drive space. We offer potential solutions to mitigate our discovered attacks, a developed tool to review if a person has been a victim of a frameup attack, and a mechanism for showing that the files were stored on a hard drive without the renter's knowledge. Our hope is that this work will inspire future security and forensics research directions in the exploration of distributed peer to peer storage systems that embrace blockchain and cryptocurrency tokens.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Blockchain has created a revolution in digital networking by using distributed storage, cryptographic algorithms, and smart contracts. Many areas are benefiting from this technology, including data integrity and security, as well as authentication and authorization. Internet of Things (IoTs) networks often suffers from such security issues, which is slowing down wide-scale adoption. In this paper, we describe the employing of blockchain technology to construct a decentralized platform for storing and trading information in the air-to-ground IoT heterogeneous network. To allow both air and ground sensors to participate in the decentralized network, we design a mutual-benefit consensus process to create uneven equilibrium distributions of resources among the participants. We use a Cournot model to optimize the active density factor set in the heterogeneous air network and then employ a Nash equilibrium to balance the number of ground sensors, which is influenced by the achievable average downlink rate between the air sensors and the ground supporters. Finally, we provide numerical results to demonstrate the beneficial properties of the proposed consensus process for air-to-ground networks and show the maximum active sensor's density utilization of air networks to achieve a high quality of service.

AB This article aims to determine what drives the price of Bitcoin. To achieve this aim, a large set of data is analysed using VEC models augmented by factors representing unobservable economic forces. They have been obtained by means of principal component analysis. This method enables us to contribute to the existing literature on Bitcoin in two ways. First, we employ the dimension reduction technique to combine variables from several papers. Second, we estimate several unobservable economic concepts instead of utilizing proxy variables as is usually done. We find that the main factor driving the Bitcoin price is its popularity. Hence, our result not only confirms some previous findings but reinforces them by providing a better definition of popularity. Finally, we conclude that the Bitcoin price is not affected by supply and demand factors in the way that is natural for conventional currencies.

TI Sentiment disagreement and bitcoin price fluctuations: a
   psycholinguistic approach
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB We investigate the extent to which Bitcoin price fluctuations are associated with investors' sentiment disagreement. We employ three textual sentiment analysis techniques: 1) a Python library offered by the Computational Linguistics and Psycholinguistics Research Center; 2) Loughran and McDonald's (2011) dictionary; and 3) semantic orientation by the point-wise mutual information method. The results show that investors' attention and sentiment disagreement induce extremely high volatility and jumps in Bitcoin prices. These findings complement existing studies on how investors' sentiment manifests in asset prices.

TI Preparation of giant vesicles supporting hindered amine on their shells
   through photo living radical polymerization-induced self-assembly
SO JOURNAL OF DISPERSION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Microsized giant vesicles supporting a hindered amine on their shells were obtained by the photopolymerization-induced self-assembly of amphiphilic diblock copolymers using the photo nitroxide mediated living radical polymerization (photo NMP) technique. The diblock copolymer consisting of hydrophilic poly(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl methacrylate) (PTPMA) and hydrophobic poly(methyl methacrylate-random-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl methacrylate), P(MMA-r-TPMA) produced various morphologies depending on the stirring speed during the photo NMP-induced self-assembly, block lengths of the copolymer, and hydrophobicity of the P(MMA-r-TPMA) block chain. A 300-rpm stirring speed during the polymerization provided worm-like vesicles with a long axis of over 100 mu m along with small spherical vesicles with a 3-mu m diameter. As the stirring speed increased to 600 rpm, the worm-like vesicles changed into spherical vesicles. A further increase in the stirring speed to 900 rpm produced much smaller spherical vesicles. The extension of the block chains also reduced the size of the vesicles. An increase in the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic block chain varied the morphology of the vesicles. While PTPMA-b-P(MMA-r-TPMA) provided spherical vesicles, PTPMA-b-P(n-propyl methacrylate (PrMA)-r-TPMA) produced deformed vesicles accompanied by a size increase. On the other hand, PTPMA-b-P(n-butyl methacrylate (BuMA)-r-TPMA) produced much smaller vesicles. Furthermore, PTPMA-b-P(MMA-r-BuMA-r-TPMA) (MMA/BuMA = 0.487/0.513) provided a morphology similar to that formed by PTPMA-b-P(PrMA-r-TPMA) due to the negligible difference in the hydrophobic energy between Pr and Me-0.487/Bu-0.513. These observations indicated that the morphology of the vesicles was controlled by manipulating the hydrophobic energy of the hydrophobic block chain.

TI Secure and Scalable mHealth Data Management Using Blockchain Combined
   With Client Hashchain: System Design and Validation
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: Blockchain is emerging as an innovative technology for secure data management in many areas, including medical practice. A distributed blockchain network is tolerant against network fault, and the registered data are resistant to tampering and revision. The technology has a high affinity with digital medicine like mobile health (mHealth) and provides reliability to the medical data without labor-intensive third-party contributions. On the other hand, the reliability of the medical data is not insured before registration to the blockchain network. Furthermore, there are issues with regard to how the clients' mobile devices should be dealt with and authenticated in the blockchain network in order to avoid impersonation.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to design and validate an mHealth system that enables the compatibility of the security and scalability of the medical data using blockchain technology.
   Methods: We designed an mHealth system that sends medical data to the blockchain network via relay servers. The architecture provides scalability and convenience of operation of the system. In order to ensure the reliability of the data from clients' mobile devices, hash values with chain structure (client hashchain) were calculated in the clients' devices and the results were registered on the blockchain network.
   Results: The system was applied and deployed in mHealth for insomnia treatment. Clinical trials for mHealth were conducted with insomnia patients. Medical data of the recruited patients were successfully registered with the blockchain network via relay servers along with the hashchain calculated on the clients' mobile devices. The correctness of the data was validated by identifying illegal data, which were made by simulating fraudulent access.
   Conclusions: Our proposed mHealth system, blockchain combined with client hashchain, ensures compatibility of security and scalability in the data management of mHealth medical practice.

TI Metcalfe's law and log-period power laws in the cryptocurrencies market
SO ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL
AB In this paper the authors investigate the statistical properties of some cryptocurrencies by using three layers of analysis: alpha-stable distributions, Metcalfe's law and the bubble behaviour through the LPPL modelling. The results show, in the medium to long-run, the validity of Metcalfe's law (the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system) for the evaluation of cryptocurrencies; however, in the short-run, the validity of Metcalfe's law for Bitcoin is questionable. According to the bidirectional causality between the price and the network size, the expected price increase is a driver for more investors to join the Bitcoin network, which may lead in the end to a super-exponential price growth, possibly due to a herding behaviour of investors. The authors then used LPPL models to capture the behaviour of cryptocurrencies exchange rates during an endogenous bubble and to predict the most probable time of the regime switching. The main conclusion of this paper is that Metcalfe's law may be valid in the long-run, however in the short-run, on various data regimes, its validity is highly debatable.

TI The use of cryptocurrencies in the money laundering process
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose This paper aims to analyze the money laundering process itself, how cryptocurrencies have been integrated into this process, and how regulatory and government bodies are responding to this new form of currency. Design/methodology/approach This paper is a theoretical paper that discusses cryptocurrencies and their role in the money laundering process. Findings Cryptocurrencies eliminate the need for intermediary financial institutions and allow direct peer-to-peer financial transactions. Because of the anonymity introduced through blockchain, cryptocurrencies have been favored by the darknet and other criminal networks. Originality/value Cryptocurrencies are a nascent form of money that first arose with the creation of bitcoin in 2009. This form of purely digital currency was meant as a direct competitor to government-backed fiat currency that are controlled by the central banking system. The paper adds to the recent discussions and debate on cryptocurrencies by suggesting additional regulation to prevent their use in money laundering and corruption schemes.

TI Potential negative effects of a cashless society Turning citizens into
   criminals and other economic dangers
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose In the past few years, several countries have begun to drastically change their economies to be entirely cash free. The point of this policy change is to hopefully prevent the amount of crime that results from the proliferation of cash. However, there are potential negative consequences to this policy change that receive little to no attention and there are several misconceptions regarding the opportunistic nature and resourcefulness of organized crime. As such, this paper aims to attempt to study these potentially negative consequences to provide some warning to countries adopting a cashless economic policy. Design/methodology/approach This is a conceptual paper relying upon an understanding of the literature in the fields of sociology, anthropology, psychology and criminology as applied to the topic of money and economic policy. Findings This paper discusses numerous negative effects to adopting a cashless economic policy, to include the proliferation of underground financing through the hawala system and organized criminal channels, the increased use of Bitcoin, the more difficult task of tracking currency through bank reporting requirements, and the potential effect of increasing other crimes, which are harder to track.
   Originality/value There have been few if any paper discussing the consequences of cashless economic policies and its implications toward organized crime. This paper is unique in both the subject matter being discussed and the conceptual arguments it puts forth.

TI LDAF: Low-Bandwidth Distributed Applications Framework in a Use Case of
   Blockchain-Enabled IoT Devices
SO SENSORS
AB In this paper, we present Low-Bandwidth Distributed Applications Framework (LDAF)an application-aware gateway for communication-constrained Internet of things (IoT) devices. A modular approach facilitates connecting to existing cloud backend servers and managing message formats and APIs' native application logic to meet the communication constraints of resource-limited end devices. We investigated options for positioning the LDAF server in fog computing architectures. We demonstrated the approach in three use cases: (i) a simple domain name system (DNS) query from the device to a DNS server, (ii) a complex interaction of a blockchainbased IoT device with a blockchain network, and (iii) difference based patching of binary (system) files at the IoT end devices. In a blockchain smart meter use case we effectively enabled decentralized applications (DApp) for devices that without our solution could not participate in a blockchain network. Employing the more efficient binary content encoding, we reduced the periodic traffic from 16 kB/s to similar to 1.1 kB/s, i.e., 7% of the initial traffic. With additional optimization of the application protocol in the gateway and message filtering, the periodic traffic was reduced to similar to 1% of the initial traffic, without any tradeoffs in the application's functionality or security. Using a function of binary difference we managed to reduce the size of the communication traffic to the end device, at least when the binary patch was smaller than the patching file.

TI Identity Management and Access Control Based on Blockchain under Edge
   Computing for the Industrial Internet of Things
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Edge computing provides a unified platform for computing, networking, and storage resources, enabling data to be processed in a timely and efficient manner near the source. Thus, it has become the basic platform for industrial Internet of things (IIoT). However, computing ' s unique features have also introduced new security problems. To solve the problem, in this paper, blockchain-based identity management combining access control mechanism is designed under edge computing. The self-certified cryptography is utilized to realize the registration and authentication of network entities. We bind the generated implicit certificate to its identity and construct the identity and certificate management mechanism based on blockchain. Secondly, an access control mechanism based on Bloom filter is designed and integrated with identity management. Moreover, for secure communication in resource-constrained edge devices, a lightweight secret key agreement protocol based on self-authenticated public key is constructed. These mechanisms work together to provide data security guarantees for IIoT such as authentication, auditability, and confidentiality.

TI A Blockchain-based Value Added Tax (VAT) System: Saudi Arabia as a
   Use-Case
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Businesses need trust to confidently perform trade among each other. Centralized business models are the only mature solutions available to perform trades over the Internet. However, they have many problems which includes but are not limited to the fact that these create bottleneck on the server as well as requires trusted third parties. Recently, decentralized solutions have gained significant popularity and acceptance for future businesses. The wide acceptance of such systems is indeed due to the trust management among various untrusted business stakeholders. Many solutions have been proposed in this regard to provide de-centralized infrastructure for various business models. A standard solution that is acceptable to the industry is still in demand. Hyperledger umbrella Blockchain projects, that are supported by IBM and many other industry big players are gaining popularity due to its efficient and pluggable design. In this study, the author present the idea of utilizing Blockchain to design a Value-Added Tax (VAT) system for Saudi Arabia's newly introduced tax system. The reason to select this business model for VAT is twofold. First, it provides an untampered distributed ledger, which cannot be deceived by any party. Each transaction in the system cannot go unnoticed by the smart contract. Secondly, it provides a transparent record, and updates all involved parties regarding each activity performed by stakeholders. The newly proposed system will provide a transparent database of VAT transactions according to our smart contract design and at each stage of supply chain, tax will be deducted and stored on peer-to-peer network via consensus process. The author believes that the proposed solution will have significant impact on VAT collection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

TI Securing light clients in blockchain with DLCP
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
AB In blockchain, full nodes (FNs) are peers that store and verify entire chains of transactions. In contrast, light clients (LCs) are those with limited resources, and for this reason, they request only block headers from FNs for transaction verification-using protocols like Simple Payment Verification (SPV). In an approach to prevent FN tampering on transaction verification (byzantine fault), LCs request block headers from multiple FNs and compare received responses. One problem with this approach is that an LC must connect to each FN and perform the same cryptographic operations with each one repeatedly, which leads to client-side complexity and slower response. We propose an alternate approach to tackle this issue, in which LCs can encrypt a request for block headers only once, and send that request to a predetermined set of FNs to access, process, and reply back in a single response. Our approach, called Distributed Lightweight Client Protocol (DLCP), enables LCs to verify with little effort if FNs have agreed on a response. From an experimental evaluation, we observed that DLCP provided lower latency and reduced computing and communication overhead in comparison with the existing conventional approach.

TI Giver and the receiver: Understanding spillover effects and predictive
   power in cross-market Bitcoin prices
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB We identify and characterise the 'givers and the receivers' of volatility in cross-market Bitcoin prices and discuss international diversification strategies in this context. Using both time and frequency domain mechanisms, we provide estimates of outward and inward spillover effects. These have implications for (weak-form) cross-market inefficiency. In our setting, we treat high-degree of spillover as an indicator of weak-form inefficiency because investors can utilise information on the dynamic spillover effects to produce a best long-run prediction of the market. Our results show that Bitcoin prices depict strong (dynamic) spillover in volatility, especially during episodes of high uncertainty. The Bitcoin-USD exchange rate possesses net predictive power, mirrored by the tendency of the Bitcoin-EURO market as a net receiver relative to other markets. Robustness exercise generally supports our claim. The overall implication is that during episodes of high uncertainty, Bitcoin markets depict greater dynamic inefficiency, instrumenting the role of asymmetric information in the path-dependence and predictive power of Bitcoin prices in an interdependent market.

Bitcoin uses a proof of work system, but there are other consensus mechanisms used by other cryptocurrencies. The performance of a cryptocurrency depends on the consensus mechanism used. This paper presents the results of a comparative evaluation that has been conducted on various significant consensus mechanisms. The unique characteristics, as well as drawbacks of each mechanism, are highlighted, together with their applications. The mechanisms are also classified into major types and those types are evaluated elaborately. The paper concludes with a discussion of the open challenges related to the available solutions.

TI A Novel Medical Blockchain Model for Drug Supply Chain Integrity
   Management in a Smart Hospital
SO ELECTRONICS
AB At present, in pharmacology one of the most serious problems is counterfeit drugs. The Health Research Funding organization reported that in developing countries, nearly 10-30% of the drugs are fake. Counterfeiting is not the main issue itself, but, rather, the fact that, as compared to traditional drugs, these counterfeit drugs produce different side effects to human health. According to WHO, around 30% of the total medicine sold in Africa, Asia, and Latin America is counterfeit. This is the major worldwide problem, and the situation is worse in developing countries, where one out of every 10 medicines are either fake or do not follow drug regulations. The rise of Internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety. It is difficult to detect counterfeits because these drugs pass through different complex distributed networks, thus forming opportunities for counterfeits to enter the authentic supply chain. The safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain has become a major concern for public health, which is a collective process. In this paper, we propose a novel drug supply chain management using Hyperledger Fabric based on blockchain technology to handle secure drug supply chain records. The proposed system solves this problem by conducting drug record transactions on a blockchain to create a smart healthcare ecosystem with a drug supply chain. A smart contract is launched to give time-limited access to electronic drug records and also patient electronic health records. We also carried out a number of experiments in order to demonstrate the usability and efficiency of the designed platform. Finally, we used Hyperledger Caliper as a benchmarking tool to conduct the performance of the designed system in terms of transactions per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization.

TI A Cross-Chain Solution to Integrating Multiple Blockchains for IoT Data
   Management
SO SENSORS
AB With the rapid development of the internet of things (IoT), traditional industries are setting off a massive wave of digitization. In the era of the Internet of Everything, millions of devices and links in IoT pose more significant challenges to data management. Most existing solutions employ centralized systems to control IoT devices, which brings about the privacy and security issues in IoT data management. Recently, blockchain has attracted much attention in the field of IoT due to its decentralization, traceability, and non-tamperability. However, it is non-trivial to apply the current blockchain techniques to IoT due to the lack of scalability and high resource costs. Different blockchain platforms have their particular advantages in the scenario of IoT data management. In this paper, we propose a cross-chain framework to integrate multiple blockchains for efficient and secure IoT data management. Our solution builds an interactive decentralized access model which employs a consortium blockchain as the control station. Other blockchain platforms customized for specific IoT scenarios run as the backbone of all IoT devices. It is equivalent to opening the off-chain channels on the consortium blockchain. Our model merges transactions in these channels for confirmation based on the notary mechanism. Finally, we implement a prototype of the proposed model based on hyperledge Fabric and IOTA Tangle. We evaluate the performance of our method through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework.

TI What drives the adoption of crypto-payments by online retailers?
SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Using a large representative sample of retailers active in e-commerce, we find that acceptance of crypto-payments is modest (2%), but there is substantial interest among online retailers to adopt them. Regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance. Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future.

TI Using Blockchains to Implement Distributed Measuring Systems
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT
AB In recent years, measuring instruments have become quite complex due to the integration of embedded systems and software components and the increasing aggregation of new features. Consequently, metrological regulation and control require more efforts from notified bodies, becoming slower and more expensive. In this paper, we evaluate the use of blockchains as a resource to overcome such challenges. We start with a conceptual model for implementing measuring instruments in a distributed blockchain-based architecture and compare it with traditional measuring instruments and distributed measuring models discussed in previous works. We also made a security analysis, demonstrating that blockchain-based measuring systems can impact the way measuring instruments are used in consumer relations while improving security and simplifying metrological regulation and control. We implement a vehicle speed measuring system using the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain platform. We evaluate the security and performance of our blockchain-based measuring system by executing tests with data from real speed meter sensors. The results are promising and validate the feasibility of our idea. Finally, we point out the main challenges related to our approach, suggesting alternatives and potential issues to be addressed by future works.

TI A Na+/Ca2+ exchanger of the olive pathogen Pseudomonas savastanoi pv.
   savastanoi is critical for its virulence
SO MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY
AB In a number of compatible plant-bacterium interactions, a rise in apoplastic Ca2+ levels is observed, suggesting that Ca2+ represents an important environmental clue, as reported for bacteria infecting mammalians. We demonstrate that Ca2+ entry in Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psav) strain DAPP-PG 722 is mediated by a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger critical for virulence. Using the fluorescent Ca2+ probe Fura 2-AM, we demonstrate that Ca2+ enters Psav cells foremost when they experience low levels of energy, a situation mimicking the apoplastic fluid. In fact, Ca2+ entry was suppressed in the presence of high concentrations of glucose, fructose, sucrose or adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Since Ca2+ entry was inhibited by nifedipine and LiCl, we conclude that the channel for Ca2+ entry is a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. In silico analysis of the Psav DAPP-PG 722 genome revealed the presence of a single gene coding for a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (cneA), which is a widely conserved and ancestral gene within the P. syringae complex based on gene phylogeny. Mutation of cneA compromised not only Ca2+ entry, but also compromised the Hypersensitive response (HR) in tobacco leaves and blocked the ability to induce knots in olive stems. The expression of both pathogenicity (hrpL, hrpA and iaaM) and virulence (ptz) genes was reduced in this Psav-cneA mutant. Complementation of the Psav-cneA mutation restored both Ca2+ entry and pathogenicity in olive plants, but failed to restore the HR in tobacco leaves. In conclusion, Ca2+ entry acts as a 'host signal' that allows and promotes Psav pathogenicity on olive plants.

TI Designing Decentralized Markets for Distribution System Flexibility
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB This paper introduces a decentralized market design, which allows a distribution system operator to manage local demand constraints by obtaining flexibility from competing aggregators, which must in-turn incentivize prosumers to provide this flexibility. The novel networked market structure accounts for distribution system operator-to-aggregator and aggregator-to-prosumer ICT infrastructure and contractual arrangements, which may limit which participants can negotiate transactions with one another. The proposed flexibility market is opt-in for prosumers, which continue to obtain energy within the existing retail electricity market. At the same time, it is underpinned by bilateral energy transactions, and could be integrated into future peer-to-peer electricity markets. Through the market, the distribution system operator, aggregators, and prosumers reach agreement on a stable outcome-a set of individually beneficial transactions no group wishes to mutually deviate from. Market outcomes also satisfy Pareto efficiency, meaning that it is not possible to make a participant better off, without making another worse off.

TI Clouded data: Privacy and the promise of encryption
SO BIG DATA & SOCIETY
AB Personal data is highly vulnerable to security exploits, spurring moves to lock it down through encryption, to cryptographically 'cloud' it. But personal data is also highly valuable to corporations and states, triggering moves to unlock its insights by relocating it in the cloud. We characterise this twinned condition as 'clouded data'. Clouded data constructs a political and technological notion of privacy that operates through the intersection of corporate power, computational resources and the ability to obfuscate, gain insights from and valorise a dependency between public and private. First, we survey prominent clouded data approaches (blockchain, multiparty computation, differential privacy, and homomorphic encryption), suggesting their particular affordances produce distinctive versions of privacy. Next, we perform two notional code-based experiments using synthetic datasets. In the field of health, we submit a patient's blood pressure to a notional cloud-based diagnostics service; in education, we construct a student survey that enables aggregate reporting without individual identification. We argue that these technical affordances legitimate new political claims to capture and commodify personal data. The final section broadens the discussion to consider the political force of clouded data and its reconstitution of traditional notions such as the public and the private.

TI Assuring Non-fraudulent Transactions in Cash on Delivery by Introducing
   Double Smart Contracts
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The adoption of decentralized cryptocurrency platforms is growing fast, thanks to the implementation of Blockchain technology and smart contracts. It encourages the novel frameworks in a wide range of applications including finance and payment methods such as cash on delivery. However, a large number of smart contracts developed for cash on delivery suffer from fraudulent transactions which enable malicious participants to break the signed contracts without sufficient penalties. A shipper will involve in the system and place a mortgage to ensure reliability. A buyer also pledges an amount of money when making the order. Our process not only ensures the interests of a seller but also prevents a fraud shipper. The penalties will be made in two scenarios: (i) the buyer refuses to receive the commodities without any reliable reasons; and (ii) the shipper attempts to make any modification on the delivered goods during transportation. To help developers create more secure and reliable cash on delivery system, we introduce double smart contracts, a framework rooted in Blockchain technology and Ethereum, to tackle those mentioned problems. We also contribute our solution as an open source software that developers can easily add to their implementation to enhance functionality.

TI A semantic pattern for trusted orchestration in IoT edge clouds
SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB Edge cloud architectures provide a layer between centralized clouds and the IoT and sensor space. In this intermediate layer, we find devices of different types that manage the communication with sensors and cloud services, but also process data from sensors locally without access to the cloud. In order to support the flexible creation, placement and usage of data and software resources in this layer, advanced orchestration techniques need to include communication and processing activities. These architectures often stretch cross organizational boundaries, causing trust concerns regarding secure data storage and the management of the identity of sensors and also the origin of data. We present an ontology-based semantic pattern that semantically defines trusted orchestration for edge clouds by linking a trust ontology to an architecture pattern and that allows reasoning about essential trust properties.

However, the core BC technology is computationally expensive and commonly involves high bandwidth overhead and delays not suitable for IoT related scenarios. In order to foster the synergy between BC and IoT, recent research advancements have specifically focused on developing novel BC approaches that are tailored to the requirements and needs of the specific IoT use cases. The paper elaborates the BC-IoT related issues and provides a comprehensive survey of the current literature and relevant initiated deployments.

TI Fine-Grained, Secure and Efficient Data Provenance on Blockchain Systems
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB The success of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies bring enormous interest to blockchains. A blockchain system implements a tamper-evident ledger for recording transactions that modify some global states. The system captures entire evolution history of the states. The management of that history, also known as data provenance or lineage, has been studied extensively in database systems. However, querying data history in existing blockchains can only be done by replaying all transactions. This approach is applicable to large-scale, offline analysis, but is not suitable for online transaction processing.
   We present LineageChain, a fine-grained, secure and efficient provenance system for blockchains. LineageChain exposes provenance information to smart contracts via simple and elegant interfaces, thereby enabling a new class of blockchain applications whose execution logics depend on provenance information at runtime. LineageChain captures provenance during contract execution, and efficiently stores it in a Merkle tree. LineageChain provides a novel skip list index designed for supporting efficient provenance query processing. We have implemented LineageChain on top of Hyperledger and a blockchain-optimized storage system called ForkBase. Our extensive evaluation of LineageChain demonstrates its benefits to the new class of blockchain applications, its efficient query, and its small storage overhead.

TI The open blockchain-aided multi-agent symbiotic cyber-physical systems
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Cyber-physical systems combine physical objects or systems with integrated computational facilities and data storage. From that perspective, Smart Grids are a mixture of physical actuators, sensors, physical communication networks; and cyber computational and communication protocols and algorithms. In our work, we propose to extend the applicability of decentralized blockchain consensus protocols to the broad field of Cyber-Physical systems. Our contribution includes a proposal of a new family of cyber-physical systems, an in-depth discussion of new possibilities and inherent shortcomings. The proposed coupling of the data storage mechanisms, communication and consensus protocols, allows for deployment of self-sustaining cyber-physical environments in which all the mission-critical aspects in both the cyber and physical layer are effectively incentivized, coordinated and maintained. This includes the essential data storage, data exchange, but also the production, transmission and distribution of energy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first such a comprehensive undertaking toward symbiotic cyber-physical systems and environments. The proposed family of systems is decentralized and does not imply the necessity of reliance on trusted third parties. We propose and discuss an architecture which incorporates physical, blockchain-enabled sensors and actuators capable of monitoring and altering parameters of the underlying physical layer. We analyze a particular instance of a blockchain-aided CPS', where we are concerned with the power grid at both the micro and macro-grid level. At the macro-grid level we explore the possibility of utilizing blockchain-enabled physical actuators. These theoretical actuators are able to introduce savings by a near real-time routing of energy and enable for tracking of power losses thanks to decentralized accountability. At the micro-grid level we propose a network of blockchain-enabled smart meters to coordinate real-time auction-based energy trade. To glue together the elements of such an open, trustless, decentralized system, we discuss an intrinsic communication protocol capable of rewarding intermediaries of a data exchange for each transmitted byte. We tackle the feasibility, security and accountability challenges which we have faced and which will need to be considered by future architects of the new, exciting family of cyber-physical systems.

TI Use of Blockchain in Healthcare: A Systematic Literature Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain is an emerging field which works on the concept of a digitally distributed ledger and consensus algorithm removing all the threats of intermediaries. Its early applications were related to the finance sector but now this concept has been extended to almost all the major areas of research including education, IoT, banking, supplychain, defense, governance, healthcare, etc. In the field of healthcare, stakeholders (provider, patient, payer, research organizations, and supply chain bearers) demand interoperability, security, authenticity, transparency, and streamlined transactions. Blockchain technology, built over the internet, has the potential to use the current healthcare data into peer to peer and interoperable manner by using a patient-centric approach eliminating the third party. Using this technology, applications can be built to manage and share secure, transparent and immutable audit trails with reduced systematic fraud. This study reviews existing literature in order to identify the major issues of various healthcare stakeholders and to explore the features of blockchain technology that could resolve identified issues. However, there are some challenges and limitations of this technology which are needed to be focused on future research.

TI Information availability and return volatility in the bitcoin Market:
   Analyzing differences of user opinion and interest
SO INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB We study returns volatility and information availability in the rapidly growing Bitcoin market. The market microstructure for bitcoins is highly developed in terms of information generation and transfer. Therefore, returns volatility is highly likely to be affected by market information availability. We analyze the relationship between returns volatility and two independent variables, user opinion difference and user interest. This study adopted the GJR-GARCH model, appropriate for volatility studies.
   First, we find that, for volatility asymmetry, the Bitcoin market exhibits greater market efficiency than the general financial market. Also, the persistence of volatility is greater. The Bitcoin market is still relatively unregulated; hence, studying the relationship between information asymmetry and regulation in the market is salient. Moreover, we can infer that the ratio of reasonable users is high in the Bitcoin market. Second, the Bitcoin market supports the sequential information arrival hypothesis in that day trading volume, which is a proxy for user differences of opinion, has a statistically significant effect on returns volatility. Third, for the proxies of user interest, namely, the growth rate of page views on Google Trends and Wikipedia, only the growth rate of Google Trends shows statistically significant effects on Bitcoin returns volatility. This study can provide useful information to the financial market and policy makers on the behavior of the Bitcoin market, which may help to lower future entry barriers and opportunity costs of the Bitcoin market.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
AB Saudi Arabia is the home for annual Hajj and ongoing Umrah pilgrimages. About eight million people from nearly two hundred countries perform these pilgrimages. To perform hajj, it is mandatory for a pilgrim to acquire a valid permit. The hajj permits are regulated by the Hajj Ministry of Saudi Arabia. Foreign pilgrims also require a valid visa to travel to Saudi Arabia. Foreigners in these pilgrimages constitute more than eighty percent of all pilgrims. Due to high demand, there is a quota for each country and also a moratorium of five years for individuals to perform Hajj. Similar restrictions are also in place for Umrah pilgrims. To obtain a permit, a pilgrim must furnish a health certificate and meet other criteria. In the past some cases of fake permits have been caught; and so, preventing and controlling this activity is an immediate need for hajj management. In this paper we propose the use of modern technologies to control and mange permits and visas efficiently. In particular, we propose a system that would use the Blockchain technology and smart contract platform to better manage the Hajj and Umrah permits and visas grants which would also efficiently address the problems of fake documents. As Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 calls for increasing the number of pilgrims to thirty million, our research is a timely solution to combat the menace of fake documents.

TI An investigation into the output tax consequences of bitcoin
   transactions for a South African value-added tax vendor
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES
AB Background: The use of bitcoin in South Africa is fairly new, but has increased as several online retailers now accept bitcoin as a means of payment. The South African Revenue Service has released a media statement regarding the normal tax treatment of cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin), but policy regarding the value-added tax (VAT) treatment of cryptocurrencies is still pending.
   Aim: The objective of the study is to determine the output tax consequences for a South African VAT vendor who receives bitcoins in exchange for the supply of goods or services that are subject to VAT, and when the same South African VAT vendor exchanges the bitcoins for South African rand at a local exchange platform.
   Setting: This article examines existing literature in a South African VAT environment.
   Method: A non-empirical study based on existing literature is performed.
   Results: It is found that when interpreting the (current) VAT Act No. 89 of 1991, the receiving of bitcoin in exchange for the supply of goods or services, as well as the exchange of bitcoin for South African rand, is subject to output tax at the standard rate of 14%, which will lead to 'double taxation'.
   Conclusion: It was shown through this study that the proposed treatment as explained in the previous section would impose 'double taxation'.

AB Blockchain systems are a fast emerging and a currently widely discussed novel strategy for a decentralized cryptographically enhanced digital ledger recording transactions among stakeholders. This perspective paper looks at its potential uses in the context of high value and mostly low volume botanical material traded globally and used as medicines, health foods, in cosmetics and other applications. We offer a perspective on key areas in the supply of such products globally and how blockchain systems may help in sustainable sourcing, quality assurance, and in tackling supply problems in cases of complex multiherbal preparations. Both open and closed blockchain systems are feasible, and it seems likely that, at least in the initial development, closed ones are the main ones to be utilized. While blockchain's potential is not yet clear, the examples presented here highlight the opportunities of this new technology.

TI SH-BlockCC: A secure and efficient Internet of things smart home
   architecture based on cloud computing and blockchain technology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB The growing demand for human-independent comfortable lifestyle has emboldened the development of smart home. A typical keenly intellective home includes many Internet of things contrivances that engender processes and immensely colossal data to efficiently handle its users' demands. This incrementing demand raises a plethora of concern cognate to a smart home system in terms of scalability, efficiency, and security. All these issues are tedious to manage, and the existing studies lack the granularity for surmounting them. Considering such a requisite of security and efficiency as a quandary at hand, this article presents a secure and efficient smart home architecture, which incorporates the blockchain and the cloud computing technologies for a cumulated solution. Because of the decentralized nature of blockchain technology, it can serve the processing services and make the transaction copy of the collected sensible user data from smart home. To ensure the security of smart home network, our proposed model utilizes the multivariate correlation analysis technique to analyze the network traffic and identify the correlation between traffic features. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture using different parameters like throughput and discovered that blockchain is an efficient security solution for the future Internet of things network.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT UNMANNED SYSTEMS
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a model for autonomous cars to establish trusted parties by combining distributed ledgers and self-driving cars in the traffic to provide single version of the truth and thus build public trust. Design/methodology/approach The model, which the authors call Witness of Things, is based on keeping decision logs of autonomous vehicles in distributed ledgers through the use of vehicular networks and vehicle-to-vehicle/vehicle-to-infrastructure (or vice versa) communications. The model provides a single version of the truth and thus helps enable the autonomous vehicle industry, related organizations and governmental institutions to discover the true causes of road accidents and their consequences in investigations. Findings In this paper, the authors explored one of the potential effects of blockchain protocol on autonomous vehicles. The framework provides a solution for operating autonomous cars in an untrusted environment without needing a central authority. The model can also be generalized and applied to other intelligent unmanned systems. Originality/value This study proposes a blockchain protocol-based record-keeping model for autonomous cars to establish trusted parties in the traffic and protect single version of the truth.

TI Privacy-aware blockchain for personal data sharing and tracking
SO OPEN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Secure data distribution is critical for data accountability. Surveillance caused privacy breaching incidents have already questioned existing personal data collection techniques. Organizations assemble a huge amount of personally identifiable information (PII) for data-driven market analysis and prediction. However, the limitation of data tracking tools restricts the detection of exact data breaching points. Blockchain technology, an 'immutable' distributed ledger, can be leveraged to establish a transparent data auditing platform. However, Art. 42 and Art. 25 of general data protection regulation (GDPR) demands 'right to forget' and 'right to erase' of personal information, which goes against the immutability of blockchain technology. This paper proposes a GDPR complied decentralized and trusted PII sharing and tracking scheme. Proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system (BcPIIMS) demonstrates data movement among GDPR entities (user, controller and processor). Considering GDPR limitations, BcPIIMS used off-the-chain data storing architecture. A prototype was created to validate the proposed architecture using multichain. The use of off-the-chain storage reduces individual block size. Additionally, private blockchain also limits personal data leaking by collecting fast approval from restricted peers. This study presents personal data sharing, deleting, modifying and tracking features to verify the privacy of proposed blockchain based personally identifiable information management system.

AB Motivated by the recent literature on cryptocurrency volatility dynamics, this paper adopts the ARJI, GARCH, EGARCH, and CGARCH models to explore their capabilities to make out-of-sample volatility forecasts for Bitcoin returns over a daily horizon from 2013 to 2018. The empirical results indicate that the ARJI jump model can cope with the extreme price movements of Bitcoin, showing comparatively superior in-sample goodness-of-fit, as well as out-of-sample predictive performance. However, due to the excessive volatility swings on the cryptocurrency market, the realized volatility of Bitcoin prices is only marginally explained by the GARCH genre of employed models.

TI Underpricing in the cryptocurrency world: evidence from initial coin
   offerings
SO MANAGERIAL FINANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze underpricing in initial coin offerings (ICO). It bridges the gap between findings in initial public offering (IPO) literature and empirical results from ICOs. Design/methodology/approach The sample set consists of 279 ICOs between April 2013 and January 2018. A regression analysis is performed with data from the ICOs. Findings The results show an average level of underpricing of ICOs of 123 percent in the USA and 97 percent in the other countries. The results for the US ICOs are significantly higher than for US IPOs on average and also higher than US IPOs at the beginning of the dot.com bubble. The authors also study the determinants of ICO underpricing. The authors use proxies based on asymmetric information from the IPO literature as well as ICO-related variables. First-day trading volume and a good sentiment on the ICO market go together with more ICO underpricing. Moreover, hot markets make first-day investors to benefit less. Finally, companies that use a large issue size or a pre-ICO (a sale of cryptocurrencies before the ICO) leave less money on the table. Practical implications The research may help in reducing underpricing, as the authors find that issuers can reduce it by holding a pre-ICO and by considering larger issue sizes. If they do so, investors will get fewer opportunities to benefit from underpricing. Investors can, nevertheless, also profit from the knowledge generated in this paper. When market sentiment is positive and first-day trading volume is expected to be high, investing in ICOs is likely to give them higher first-day returns. Finally, the authors hope that this paper will serve as a basis for further research into the exciting and dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value There is hardly any research on underpricing of ICOs. The paper is interesting for its table with a brief comparison of ICOs and IPOs. It also searches for variables from the asymmetric information theory behind IPOs to be applied in explaining ICOs. It shows high levels of ICO underpricing in comparison to IPOs. It also gives suggestions for issuers of (and investors in) ICOs.

TI RSA public keys with inside structure: Proofs of key generation and
   identities for web-of-trust
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS
AB We propose a construction of the modulus of the RSA public keys for decentralized public-key trust generation like Web-of-Trust, where the modulus has inside structure. The first function of the structure is that it enables a peer to verify that the owner of the public key certainly generated the corresponding secret key. The second function is to tie up the public key with the owner's identity as well as her guarantors identities. Our construction is based on the modified version of the Lenstra's algorithm, by which a related second public key and the identity strings are embedded into the RSA modulus. The second public key is of the elliptic-curve cryptosystem (ECC) which has almost equivalent security level to the RSA cryptosystem. Our construction is applicable to a peer-to-peer network equipped with the blockchain of "consortium" and "trusted" type to yield a flat network that does not depends on PKI of the X.509 type.

TI Bitcoin and the GDPR: Allocating responsibility in distributed networks
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB This article uses the example of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to show how distributed networks challenge existing legal mechanisms of allocating responsibility. The Bitcoin network stores personal data by automated means. Furthermore, full nodes qualify as establishments and the network offers a service to citizens in the EU. The data processing within the Bitcoin network therefore falls into the material and territorial scope of the GDPR. To protect data subjects, the GDPR allocates responsibility to the controller, who determines the 'how' and the 'why' of the data processing. However, the distributed structure of the Bitcoin network blurs the lines between actors who are responsible and actors who are worth protecting. Neither the Bitcoin users running lightweight nodes or full nodes nor the miners determine the 'how' and the 'why' of the data processing. They carry out their network activities according to the Bitcoin protocol, which can only be adopted and enforced by a collective of full nodes and miners. Members of this collective are joint controllers under Article 26 GDPR, which obliges them to clearly and transparently determine their respective responsibilities for compliance with the GDPR. However, this mechanism fails because of the very structure it aims to eliminate. Therefore, a solution to allocating responsibility for data protection in distributed networks lies outside the GDPR.

TI Privacy Enhancing Technologies in the Internet of Things: Perspectives
   and Challenges
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Internet of Things (IoT) devices have brought much efficiency and convenience to our daily life. However, the devices may collect a myriad of data from people without their consent. Controlling the large amount of data generated from the devices from being misused is critical to mitigate privacy risks. Therefore, privacy protection on personal data has become an important factor in the development of the IoT. Historically, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) can effectively enhance the privacy and protect users' personally identifiable information. To date, many researchers have stressed the importance of PETs and proposed solutions relevant to different application fields of the IoT. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the research has analyzed the PETs in IoT from the aspects of privacy threat issues and privacy legislation. As a result, this paper surveys on the solutions of PETs in the field of IoT, which has filtered down from the large number of published academic papers to the 120 primary studies published between 2014 and 2017. After collecting the papers, we categorized them based on the functions and the coverage of privacy protection, and analyzed them from different aspects, ranging from high-level principles of general data protection regulations and ISO/IEC 29100:2011 requirements to the actual resolution of privacy threats in IoT. Thus, we aim to identify the current state of development of the PETs in various fields and examine whether the existing PETs comply with the latest legal principles and privacy standards and reduce the threats to privacy. Finally, recommendations for future research are given based on the results.

Transaction costs account for a significant proportion of each new or refurbished facility (a 2017 report from the Infrastructure Client Group in the UK suggests as high as 50%), yet they contribute no value to the customer. Blockchain is being suggested as a way to reduce transaction costs by eliminating the need for intermediaries to build trust as a prerequisite for successfully executed agreements. This study first describes the thinking that underpins blockchain technology, outlining how it works, and the potential limitations of the technology. Second, using a case study, reviews the potential cost savings from the use of blockchain for a real estate company. The results reveal a potential cost savings from blockchain deployment at 8.3% of the total cost of residential construction, with a standard deviation of 1.26%. Third, we explore the implications, risks and applications of blockchain technology for improving flow in the end-to-end design and construction process and we identify opportunities for future research on blockchain applications in construction.

TI Towards a Mechanism for Protecting Seller's Interest of Cash on Delivery
   by using Smart Contract in Hyperledger
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB In emerging economies, with the explosion of e-commerce, payment methods have increasingly enhanced security. However, Cash-on-Delivery (COD) payment method still prevails in cash-based economies. Although COD allows consumers to be more proactive in making payments, it still appears to be vulnerable by the appearance of a third party (shipping companies). In this paper, we proposed a payment system based on "smart contract" implemented on top of blockchain technology to minimize risks for parties. The platform consists of a set of rules that each party must follow including specific delivery time and place, cost of delivery, mortgage money; thereby, forcing parties to be responsible for their tasks in order to complete the contract. We also provided a detailed implementation to illustrate the efficiency of our model.

TI An Empirical Analysis of Bitcoin Price Jump Risk
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Given that there are both continuous and discontinuous components in the movement of asset prices, existing asset pricing models that assume only continuous price movements should be revised. In this paper, we explore the features of jumps, which are discontinuous movements, by examining Bitcoin pricing. First, we identify jumps in the Bitcoin price on a daily basis, applying a non-parametric methodology and then break down the Bitcoin total rate of return into a jump rate of return and a continuous rate of return. In our empirical analysis, price jumps turn out to be independent of volatility. Moreover, the jumps in the Bitcoin price do not appear at regular intervals; rather, they tend to be concentrated in clusters during special periods, implying that once an economic crisis occurs, the crisis will last for a long time due to contagion effects and the economy will take a considerable amount of time to recover fully. Further, the contribution of the jump rate of return to the total rate of return of the Bitcoin price is lower than the contribution of the continuous return, implying that the pursuit of sustainable returns rather than large but temporary returns will improve the total rate of return over the long term. Finally, more jumps are observed when trading volume is lower, implying that market illiquidity drives discontinuous movement in asset prices. Overall, the features of jump risk are like two sides of the same coin and jump risks are expected to have a significant effect on asset pricing, suggesting that consideration of jumps is essential for risk management as well as asset pricing.

TI eHAPAC: A Privacy-Supported Access Control Model for IP-Enabled Wireless
   Sensor Networks
SO SENSORS
AB The implementation of IP technology in wireless sensor networks has promoted the development of many smart scenarios. To enhance secure access in IP-enabled wireless sensor networks, access control to sensor nodes is a necessary process. However, access control currently faces two challenges, feasibility and preservation of user access privacy. In this paper, we propose eHAPAC, a novel privacy-preserving access control model for IP-enabled wireless sensor networks. The contributions of our paper include three parts. First, this paper integrates the Hidra access control protocol and APAC privacy-preserving model, addressing the issue of privacy-preserving access control in resource-constrained devices. Second, this paper proposes an enhanced Hidra protocol to implement the unlinkability of protocol message exchanges. Third, to solve the problem of third party credibility, this paper improves the group signature-based APAC model and utilizes blockchain technology to manage the storage and publication of public group signature keys. Security analysis and performance evaluation prove that our protocol is secure and effective.

TI Research on Risk Avoidance and Coordination of Supply Chain Subject
   Based on Blockchain Technology
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Based on the influence of block chain technology on information sharing among supply chain participants, mean-CVaR (conditional value at risk) is used to characterize retailers' risk aversion behavior, while a Stackelberg game is taken to study the optimal decision-making of manufacturers and retailers during decentralized and centralized decision-making processes. Finally, the mean-CVaR-based revenue-sharing contract is used to coordinate the supply chain and profit distribution. The research shows that, under the condition of decentralized decision-making, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is low, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion and the risk aversion degree, while, when the retailer's optimal order quantity is high, it is an increasing function of the weighted proportion, and has nothing to do with the risk aversion degree. The manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a reduction function of the weighted proportion. When the retailer's order quantity is low, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application degree is a decreasing function of risk aversion, while, when the retailer's order quantity is high, the manufacturer's blockchain technology application is independent of risk aversion. The profit of the supply chain system under centralized decision-making is higher than that of decentralized decision-making. The revenue sharing contract can achieve the coordination of the supply chain to the level of centralized decision-making. Through blockchain technology, transaction costs among members of the supply chain can be reduced, information sharing can be realized, and the benefits of the supply chain can be improved. Finally, the specific numerical simulation is adopted to analyze the weighted proportion, risk aversion and the impact of blockchain technology on the supply chain, and verify the relevant conclusions.

TI Distributed, decentralized, and democratized artificial intelligence
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The accelerating investment in artificial intelligence has vast implications for economic and cognitive development globally. However, AI is currently dominated by an oligopoly of centralized mega-corporations, who focus on the interests of their stakeholders. There is a now universal need for AI services by businesses who lack access to capital to develop their own Al services, and independent Al developers lack visibility and a source of revenue. This uneven playing field has a high potential to lead to inequitable circumstances with negative implications for humanity. Furthermore, the potential of Al is hindered by the lack of interoperability standards. The authors herein propose an alternative path for the development of AI: a distributed, decentralized, and democratized market for AIs run on distributed ledger technology. We describe the features and ethical advantages of such a system using SingularityNET, a watershed project being developed by Ben Goertzel and colleagues, as a case study. We argue that decentralizing Al opens the doors for a more equitable development of AI and AGI. It will also create the infrastructure for coordinated action between AIs that will significantly facilitate the evolution of AI into true AGI that is both highly capable and beneficial for humanity and beyond.

SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB To date, there is a considerable lack of transparency in the sales of digital assets between the author and providers of the digital assets, which typically leads to denying the authors from receiving their fair share of royalty. This paper proposes a blockchain-based framework and solution for online publishing and sale of digital assets. The solution is based on utilizing smart contracts of Ethereum blockchain to govern the sales of e-books and ensure that the payment is dispersed in cryptocurrency as agreed among the publisher(s) and the author. Our solution handles cases related to incentives for both publishers and customers to ensure integral delivery of the digital books, failure of downloads, and refunds. We provide the full code of the Ethereum smart contract, and we also performed security vulnerability analysis to ascertain that our smart contract is bug free and secure against known attacks and vulnerabilities.

TI Efficient Micropayment of Cryptocurrency from Blockchains
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
AB Cryptocurrencies based on blockchain infrastructures have shown their advantages such as double-spending resistance and decentralization. Each transaction of cryptocurrency requires a certain amount of computation and attracts transaction fees. Often, in practice, many transactions are small; therefore, they add computation and transmission overheads to the system. In this paper, we introduce a cost-saving approach, which significantly reduces transaction time and storage for small amount of payment, i.e. micropayment. In our approach, with the notion of transaction commitment', the computation of each transaction is much more efficient. Therefore, our approach has advantages in comparison of other cryptocurrency systems such as the bitcoin system. Our approach can be applied to other existing cryptocurrency systems.

TI Cryptocurrencies. Money is not everything but ...
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR HERZ THORAX UND GEFASSCHIRURGIE
AB After now nearly 10 years of existence, in recent years cryptocurrencies have undergone a remarkable development. Awareness and market capitalization as well as trading volume have greatly increased in a long-term comparison but recently since the beginning of 2018 they have dropped massively in value. The question must be asked: are cryptocurrencies the future or only a fad, a hype? The blockchain, a technology that found its first main application in cryptocurrencies, will be applied in the future far beyond this field and possible accelerate the way to a cash-free future. The worldwide transfer of money could also be accelerated because a transaction with cryptocurrencies on the other side of the world can reach the recipient after only a few minutes. This obviously happens faster or slower depending on the cryptocurrency. The different currencies generate their own technologies and procedures, which are designed to increase the safety, stability and velocity. Whether banks and governments will also utilize the world of digital currencies in the future, remains to be seen.

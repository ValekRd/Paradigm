TI Blockchain in Supply Chain: Journey from Disruptive to Sustainable
SO JOURNAL OF MECHANICS OF CONTINUA AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES
AB "Whereas most technologies tend to automate workers on the periphery doing menial tasks, blockchains automate away the center. Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly." - Vitalik Buterin, co-founder Ethereum and Bitcoin Magazine
   Blockchain has evolved to be the most discussed and potentially disruptive technology and is expected to become a driving force for technology-based business innovations. Although blockchain is still in infancy in terms of technological maturity, experimental adoption and customization are already in progress. One of its' early adopters, Supply chain Management is expecting to find fascinating solutions for its most pressing issues like confidentiality and trust, along with those of the inability to share information between supply chain partners, limitations of IT systems and lack of data standards. This paper is an attempt to seek the applicability of blockchain technology in the business process of Supply Chain Management. The Paper provides a comprehensive map for technical feasibility of a blockchain based supply chain through the distributed concepts including proof of work, consensus, and smart contracts.

TI Paris is not enough: Toward an Information Technology (IT) enabled
   transnational climate policy
SO ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB The 2015 Paris Agreement was undoubtedly an important diplomatic achievement. Organizations and experts have rallied around it, all the more since the attack against the agreement by the current US administration. This rally has led to a collective unwillingness to acknowledge what the evidence already tells us: the Paris Agreement and the currently dominant, international approach to climate change policy will not work. Much faster and more decisive change is needed; a paradigm shift. We need a policy which provides for a realistic yet rapid transition from our dependence on cheap fossil fuels to deep decarbonization and a sustained reliance on renewable sources of energy. We argue in this paper that, thanks to advances in Information Technology (IT) and social media, viable options exist for an alternative global, transnational climate policy. Three key principles have to be followed: (i) gradual expansion across boundaries; (ii) use of economic incentives to compel behavioral change; and (iii) a close link between the price of carbon and the use of raised funds. The funds from the climate risk surcharge collected on fossil fuels at the source, a central piece of the proposal, are to be used for subsidizing adaption to and insurance against damage from climate change. The paper argues that the challenges in terms of information requirements and institutional resistance can be overcome if IT solutions are deployed within a public-private governance framework that protects the public interest.

TI Bitcoin return: Impacts from the introduction of new altcoins
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB The model predicting Bitcoin price formation remains a mystery to academia and investors. Newly invented cryptocurrencies (alternative coins-altcoins) with enhanced features may become close substitutes to Bitcoin in terms of risk diversification. Employing AutoregressiveDistributed- Lag (ARDL) estimations, we document the evidence that the introduction of a new altcoin tends to lower Bitcoin return by 0.7% which is substantial given that the average and median daily returns of Bitcoin are 0.63% and 0.27%, respectively. Our study suggests that the negative impact of an Initial Public Offering on existing stock prices can also be observed in the cryptocurrency market: altcoin introductions reduce Bitcoin return.

TI MicroBTC: Efficient, Flexible and Fair Micropayment for Bitcoin Using
   Hash Chains
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB While Bitcoin gains increasing popularity in different payment scenarios, the transaction fees make it difficult to be applied to micropayment. Given the wide applicability of micropayment, it is crucial for all cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin to provide effective support therein. In light of this, a number of low-cost micropayment schemes for Bitcoin have been proposed recently to reduce micropayment costs. Existing schemes, however, suffer from drawbacks such as high computation cost, inflexible payment value, and possibly unfair exchanges. The paper proposes two new micropayment schemes, namely the basic MicroBTC and the advanced MicroBTC, for Bitcoin by integrating the hash chain technique into cryptocurrency transactions. The basic MicroBTC realizes micropayment by exposing hash pre-images on the hash chain one by one, and it can also make arbitrary micropayments by exposing multiple hash pre-images. We further design the advanced MicroBTC to achieve non-interactive refund and efficient hash chain verification. We analyze the complexity and security of the both MicroBTC schemes and implement them using the Bitcoin source code. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate their performance, and the result showed that a micropayment session can be processed within about 18ms for the basic MicroBTC and 9ms for the advanced MicroBTC on a laptop. Both schemes enjoy great efficiency in computation and flexibility in micropayments, and they also achieve fairness for both the payer and the payee.

TI Exploration of blockchain-enabled decentralized capability-based access
   control strategy for space situation awareness
SO OPTICAL ENGINEERING
AB Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven application systems framework couples online data with offline models to enhance performance by using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control (AC) to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized AC system, which can either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, we introduce blockchain-enabled, decentralized, capability-based access control (BlendCAC), a decentralized authentication, and capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services, and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components can identify and update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proofof- concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i. e., Raspberry Pi nodes emulating satellites with sensor observations) and more powerful computing devices (i. e., laptops emulating a ground network) and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight, and fine-grained AC solution for space system toward SSA.

TI Comparison of monoexponential, intravoxel incoherent motion
   diffusion-weighted imaging and diffusion kurtosis imaging for assessment
   of hepatic fibrosis
SO ACTA RADIOLOGICA
AB Background Hepatic fibrosis is a dynamic, reversible process which can result in liver failure. Diagnosis and monitoring of hepatic fibrosis are clinically important. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and monoexponential diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to detect clinically significant fibrosis (>= F2). Material and Methods This retrospective study was approved by Institutional Review Board and the requirement of informed consent was waived. One hundred and six patients were included who underwent liver multiple b-value DWI (10 b-values at 0-1000 s/mm(2)) at 1.5 T and were histologically diagnosed with hepatic fibrosis. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), DKI-derived apparent kurtosis (Kapp) and diffusivity (Dapp), and IVIM-derived true diffusion (Dt), pseudodiffusion (D*), and perfusion fraction (f) were compared between no or early fibrosis (F0-1, n = 19) and clinically significant fibrosis (>= F2, n = 87). Diagnostic performance was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results F2-4 had a significantly lower D* (59.9 +/- 16.3 vs. 86.2 +/- 21.0 [x10(-3) mm(2)/s]) and Dapp (3.46 +/- 0.79 vs. 4.07 +/- 0.76 [x10(-3) mm(2)/s]) but higher Kapp (1.10 +/- 0.18 vs. 0.98 +/- 0.12) than F0-1 (P < 0.01). ADC, Dt, and f did not show significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). The area under the ROC curve for diagnosis of clinically significant fibrosis (>= F2) was significantly larger in D* (0.89; 95% CI = 0.81-0.94) than Dapp (0.73; 95% CI = 0.63-0.81) and Kapp (0.75; 95% CI = 0.65-0.83) (P = 0.017 and 0.012, respectively). Conclusion IVIM-DWI might be more suitable for detecting hepatic fibrosis than the monoexponential and kurtosis model, and D* showed a better diagnostic performance to detect clinically significant fibrosis than other parameters.

TI A secure versatile light payment system based on blockchain
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Ever-increasing transaction costs, serious network congestion, and low transaction rates in the current blockchain systems restrict their extensive use. To relieve from this situation, we present a secure versatile light payment (SVLP) scheme. The SVLP merely employs a digital signature algorithm and a one-way function and has similar security comparing to existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed scheme is of ultra-low power consumption, since the payers and payees only need one-way functions to achieve multiple transactions, instead of the costly digital signature algorithms. Furthermore, the processes of payment and refunding are flexible. This is due to the fact that the denomination in our scheme possesses divisibility and the users need not to verify the preimages on the long chain one-byone. Finally, as the transaction can be taken off-chain and offline, it can be even used in remote areas or geological disasters areas where communication infrastructures are lacked or destroyed. All these features indicate that our scheme is practical and versatile. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Dynamic anonymous identity authentication (DAIA) scheme for VANET
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
AB With the development of the vehicular ad hoc network, the security and privacy are now becoming vital concerns, especially when the attacker owns more and more resources. In order to address these concerns, a dynamic anonymous identity authentication scheme is proposed using Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem and blockchain method, which guarantees the security and fast off-line authentication for vehicle-to-infrastructure. Specifically, a dynamic pseudonym key is generated using tamper proof device (TPD) for off-line authentication and anonymity when a vehicle roams among different roadside units' (RSUs) communication ranges. Even if all RSUs are compromised, vehicle's identity is still privacy. Moreover, two additional design goals are more suitable for the practical environment: (1) the reduced assumption of TPD; (2) certification authority can trace vehicle under the authorization by law.

TI eHealth Integrity Model Based on Permissioned Blockchain
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB (1) Background: Large eHealth systems should have a mechanism to detect unauthorized changes in patients' medical documentation, access permissions, and logs. This is due to the fact that modern eHealth systems are connected with many healthcare providers and sites. (2) Methods: Design-science methodology was used to create an integrity-protection service model based on blockchain technology. Based on the problem of transactional transparency, requirements were specified and a model was designed. After that, the model's security and performance were evaluated. (3) Results: a blockchain-based eHealth integrity model for ensuring information integrity in eHealth systems that uses a permissioned blockchain with off-chain information storage was created. In contrast to existing solutions, the proposed model allows information removal, which in many countries' eHealth systems is a legal requirement, and is based on a blockchain using the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithm. (4) Conclusion: A blockchain can be used to store medical data or only security-related data. In the proposed model, a blockchain is mainly used to implement a data-integrity service. This service can be implemented using other mechanisms, but a blockchain provides a solution that does not require trusted third parties, works in a distributed eHealth environment, and supports document removal.

TI On the nature and financial performance of bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF RISK FINANCE
AB Purpose The purpose of this article is to provide some insights on the true nature of bitcoin and to study empirically its performance by using robust models, widely used in the academic literature. Previous studies assess performance with simple measures such as the Sharpe ratio. Such measures are insufficient because they do not take into account the bitcoin's specificities, such as the possibilities to diversify risk. Design/methodology/approach The authors use quantitative methodologies to assess the performance of financial assets. Performance is defined as a risk-adjusted return. The authors use regression analysis and measure bitcoin's performance as the constant term (alpha) of the projection of its returns on the returns of relevant factors of risk. Findings Bitcoin has low correlation with the market index and with factor-mimicking portfolios, which indicates opportunities to diversify risk. The performance of bitcoin (alpha) is positive and significant; this result is robust across period and world region specifications.
   Originality/value This paper adds to the literature by arguing that bitcoin has the nature of common stock, and therefore, its performance has to be assessed with models that are relevant for this type of securities. This paper is the first using performance models that adjust returns for relevant sources of risk.

SO ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose Smart cities provide fully integrated and networked connectivity between virtual/digital assets and physical building/infrastructure assets to form digital economies. However, industrial espionage, cyber-crime and deplorable politically driven cyber-interventions threaten to disrupt and/or physically damage the critical infrastructure that supports national wealth generation and preserves the health, safety and welfare of the populous. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of cyber-threats confronting critical infrastructure asset management reliant upon a common data environment to augment building information modelling (BIM) implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach An interpretivist, methodological approach to reviewing pertinent literature (that contained elements of positivism) was adopted. The ensuing mixed methods analysis: reports upon case studies of cyber-physical attacks; reveals distinct categories of hackers; identifies and reports upon the various motivations for the perpetrators/actors; and explains the varied reconnaissance techniques adopted.
   Findings The paper concludes with direction for future research work and a recommendation to utilize innovative block chain technology as a potential risk mitigation measure for digital built environment vulnerabilities.
   Originality/value While cyber security and digitization of the built environment have been widely covered within the extant literature in isolation, scant research has hitherto conducted an holistic review of the perceived threats, deterrence applications and future developments in a digitized Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector. This review presents concise and lucid reference guidance that will intellectually challenge, and better inform, both practitioners and researchers in the AECO field of enquiry.

TI "The margin between the edge of the world and infinite possibility"
   Blockchain, GDPR and information governance
SO RECORDS MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper aims to explore a paradoxical situation, asking whether it is possible to reconcile the immutable ledger known as blockchain with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and more broadly privacy and data protection. Design/methodology/approach This paper combines doctrinal legal research examining the GDPR's application and scope with case studies examining blockchain solutions from an archival theoretic perspective to answer several questions, including: What risks are blockchain solutions said to impose (or mitigate) for organizations dealing with data that is subject to the GDPR? What are the relationships between the GDPR principles and the principles of archival theory? How can these two sets of principles be aligned within a particular blockchain solution? How can archival principles be applied to blockchain solutions so that they support GDPR compliance? Findings This work will offer an initial exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain solutions for GDPR compliant information governance. It will present the disjunctures between GDPR requirements and some current blockchain solution designs and implementations, as well as discussing how solutions may be designed and implemented to support compliance. Immutability of information recorded on a blockchain is a differentiating positive feature of blockchain technology from the perspective of trusted exchanges of value (e.g. cryptocurrencies) but potentially places organizations at risk of non-compliance with GDPR if personally identifiable information cannot be removed. This work will aid understanding of how blockchain solutions should be designed to ensure compliance with GDPR, which could have significant practical implications for organizations looking to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to meet their needs and strategic goals.
   Research limitations/implications -Some aspects of the social layer of blockchain solutions, such as law and business procedures, are also well understood. Much less well understood is the data layer, and how it serves as an interface between the social and the technical in a sociotechnical system like blockchain. In addition to a need for more research about the data/records layer of blockchains and compliance, there is a need for more information governance professionals who can provide input on this layer, both to their organizations and other stakeholders. Practical implications - Managing personal data will continue to be one of the most challenging, fraught issues for information governance moving forward; given the fairly broad scope of the GDPR, many organizations, including those outside of the EU, will have to manage personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Blockchain technology could play an important role in ensuring organizations have easily auditable, tamper-resistant, tamper-evident records to meet broader organizational needs and to comply with the GDPR. Social implications - Because the GDPR professes to be technology-neutral, understanding its application to novel technologies such as blockchain provides an important window into the broader context of compliance in evolving information governance spaces.

SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON INFORMATION SECURITY
AB Blockchains are proposed for many application domains apart from financial transactions. While there are generic blockchains that can be molded for specific use cases, they often lack a lightweight and easy-to-customize implementation. In this paper, we introduce the core concepts of blockchain technology and investigate a real-world use case from the energy domain, where customers trade portions of their photovoltaic power plant via a blockchain. This does not only involve blockchain technology, but also requires user interaction. Therefore, a fully custom, private, and permissioned blockchain is implemented from scratch. We evaluate and motivate the need for blockchain technology within this use case, as well as the desired properties of the system. We then describe the implementation and the insights from our implementation in detail, serving as a guide for others and to show potential opportunities and pitfalls when implementing a blockchain from scratch.

TI A Novel Chip-Level Blockchain Security Solution for the Internet of
   Things Networks
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB The widespread computer network has been changing drastically and substantially since blockchain and IoT entered the stage. Blockchain is good at protecting data transactions between logical nodes with a desirable guaranty. Internet of Things (IoT), on the other hand, by providing ultimate convenience to consumers, is expected to give rise to many various merits in a broad business scene. The security of IoT is still an open problem and if blockchain can reinforce IoT security, as many authors have hoped in recent papers, these newcomers appear to make a good collaboration to reinforce IoT security. However, software copes with logical nodes and IoT involves a vast number of physical nodes (IoT devices). Enabling blockchain to protect IoT cannot be brought to reality without respectively identifying logical and physical nodes. This is identical to the Proof-of-Trust problem. In this article, we propose a conceptual solution-Blockchained IoT-and show that this concept is able to be realized on-chip level using mass-produced dynamical random access memory (DRAM). We have completed the first test of longevity and temperature dependence (-40 degrees C to 105 degrees C) to confirm the necessary characteristics for the 5G base stations that are known to have an issue of self-heating. Furthermore, we have coarsely evaluated the probability of two DRAM IC chips being associated with an identical cyber-physical chip identification accidentally. Then, such a probability is minimal.

TI Fusion of the Brooks-Iyengar Algorithm and Blockchain in
   Decentralization of the Data-Source
SO JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS
AB Information fusion has been a topic of immense interest owing to its applicability in various applications. This brings to the fore the need for a flexible and accurate fusion algorithm that can be versatile. The Brooks-Iyengar algorithm is one such fusion algorithm. It has since its inception found numerous applications that deal with the fusion of data from multiple sources. The uniqueness of the Brooks-Iyengar algorithm is the ease with which the data from multiple sensors in a local system can be fused and also reach consensus in a distributed system with the added capability of fault tolerance. Blockchain has found its use as a distributed ledger and has successfully supported and fueled many crypto-currencies over the years. Information fusion with regards to Blockchains is a topic of great research interest in the past couple of years. Since blockchain has no official node, the introduction of a decentralized network and a consensus algorithm is required in making the interactions and exchanges between multiple suppliers easier and thus leads to business being carried out without any hassles. In this paper, we attempt to understand and describe the deployment of multiple sensors to measure various aspects of the physical world. We discuss a novel technique of employing the Brooks-Iyengar algorithm in the design of the system that would decentralize the data source from the corresponding measurements and thus ensure the integrity of the transactions in the Blockchain. Finally, a theoretical analysis of the performance of the algorithm when used in a blockchain based decentralized environment is also discussed.

TI The Promise of Blockchain Technology for Global Securities and
   Derivatives Markets: The New Financial Ecosystem and the "Holy Grail' of
   Systemic Risk Containment
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB Weaknesses in investor control over their investments and in warehousing systemic risk in modern Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) are the result of a combination of market failures and of structural flaws deeply ingrained in modern financial markets. Yet the utility of complex FMI comprising long custodial chains and large global Central Counterparties (CCPs) for the operation of modern markets is not seriously disputed. The change in the technology paradigm with the introduction of DLT systems for securities and derivatives FMI can increase investor control, the efficiency of risk management and, to some extent, augment the distribution of systemic risk. It can thus create a more diverse and resilient financial ecosystem. This cross-disciplinary paper identifies a multitude of reasons that favour a paradigm shift in FMI technology. It also sketches a comprehensive blockchain-based framework for the development of permission-based platforms for derivatives clearing and settlement and the handling of liquidity shortages within DLT systems. Arguably, the impact of technological change should lead to a reduction of industry rents for the benefit of end investors and of the end users of finance (entrepreneurs and businesses) enhancing market welfare. Therefore, the use of blockchain technology in FMI can transform the structure and future direction of the financial services industry as a whole.

TI Crypto anchors
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Blockchain technology can increase visibility in supply-chain transactions and lead to more accurate tracing of goods as well as provide evidence of whether a product is authentic or not. A shared, distributed ledger or blockchain alone, however, does not guarantee correct and trustworthy supply-chain traceability. We argue that blockchain technology (and any other digital traceability solution) must be enhanced with methods to "anchor" physical objects into information technology, Internet-of-Things and blockchain systems. Only when trust from the digital domain is extended to the physical domain can the movement of goods be accurately traced (e.g., for callbacks and provenance) and product authenticity determined. In this paper, we introduce the concept of crypto anchors, propose a classification and system architecture, and give implementation examples for different use cases and industries.

TI End-to-End Voting with Non-Permissioned and Permissioned Ledgers
SO JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING
AB We propose a decentralised end-to-end voting platform (from voter to candidate) based on the block-chain technology. In particular, we study and exploit both the non-permissioned ledger of Bitcoin, and the MultiChain permissioned ledger. We describe the main architectural choices behind the two implementations, including the pre-voting and post-voting phases. Similar approaches are not as decentralised as our application, where it is possible to directly cast a vote to the block-chain, without any intermediate level. Benefits and drawbacks of each implementation are explained. The Bitcoin block-chain consists in a large number of already available nodes in the related peer-to-peer network; moreover, its reliability and resistance to attacks are also well established. With MultiChain we instead exploit a fine-grained permission system: MultiChain is a permissioned public ledger. Hence, with it we can also satisfy two more properties of end-to-end voting systems: uncoercibility and receipt-freeness and data confidentiality and neutrality. Moreover, we can avoid costs and price fluctuations related to Bitcoin.

TI Trust Provision in the Internet of Things Using Transversal Blockchain

SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB The Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm faces new and genuine challenges and problems associated, mainly, with the ubiquitous access to the Internet, the huge number of devices involved and the heterogeneity of the components making up this new global network. In this context, protecting these systems against cyberattacks and cybercrimes has turn into a basic issue. In relation to this topic, most proposed solutions in the literature are focused on security; however other aspects have to be considered (such as privacy or trust). Therefore, in this paper we define a theoretical framework for trust in IoT scenarios, including a mathematical formalization and a discussion about the requirements which should fulfill a solution for trust provision. An analysis of these requirements shows that blockchain technology meets them perfectly, so a first trust provision system based on blockchain networks is also provided. An experimental validation is also proposed and performed in order to evaluate the described solution.

AB The emergence of enormous disparate data sources, available in a multitude of alternate formats, and on very different devices, is leading to a business process revolution. This paper argues for a new approach in which these technologies are used to replace outdated blanket government intervention programs. Highly targeted interventions for social programs identified and addressed by Big Data-based methodologies would replace outdated government programs. This approach advocates for original detective methodologies, direct government action, and outcome monitoring all of which utilize Big Data-based frequent examination. The government would be in a privileged situation where it could obtain data not available to most other parties due to privacy laws. The data structures of the government would be protected by encryption and blockchain privacy-protection methodologies that would only reveal targeted outcomes to the direct-action agent. These same methodologies are applicable for business measurement (accounting) and assurance (audit).

TI Regulatory Fitness: Fintech, Funny Money, and Smart Contracts
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB This article argues that there are many questions that lawyers might ask, and conversations that they might have, about smart contracts; that some questions that are asked are more important than others; and that there are some questions that are not asked but which should be asked. First, it is argued that the question that preoccupies coherentists' (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic fiat contracts' that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed. Secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a regulatory-instrumentalist' nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. Thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had. Blockchain is a potentially transformative technology and it is important to have more fundamental conversations about the kind of community that we want to be.

SO INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING
AB Nowadays, more and more smartphones communicate to each other's by using some popular Next Generation Instant Messaging (NGIM) applications (Apps) which are based on the blockchain (BC) technologies, such as XChat, via IPv4/IPv6 dual stack network environments. Owing to XChat addresses are soon to be implemented as stealth addresses, any DoS attack activated form malicious XChat node will be treated as a kind of DDoS attack. Therefore, the huge NGIM usages with stealth addresses in IPv4/IPv6 dual stack mobile networks, mobile devices will suffer the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack from Internet. The probing method is deployed in this paper by using the active ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) protocol. Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide the active approach based on the integrated entropy calculations for the NGIM traffics, the numbers of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the abnormal events found and counted after active inquiring ICMP procedure. However, many DDoS attacks in Internet were found to paralyze NGIM Apps on smartphones. It is a lightweight approach could be applied in mobile device.

TI Blockchain: An enabler for healthcare and life sciences transformation
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Major trends in healthcare and life sciences (HCLS) include huge amounts of and longitudinal patient data, policies on a patient's rights to access and control their data, a move from fee-for-service to outcome-based contracts, and regulatory and privacy requirements. Blockchain, as a distributed transactional system of record, can provide underpinnings to enable these trends and enable transformative opportunities in HCLS by providing immutable data on a shared ledger, secure and authenticated transactions, and smart contracts that can represent rules that are executed with secure transactions. We describe HCLS use cases leveraging these facets of blockchain, including patient consent and health data exchange, outcome-based contracts, next-generation clinical trials, supply chain, and payments and claims. We then describe a blockchain-based architecture and platform for enabling these use cases. Finally, we outline a realization of this architecture in a case study and outline further research topics in this domain.

TI Legal Consequences of the Invalidity of a Transaction made by Using
   Information 'Technology: Problems of Theory and Practice
SO AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
AB The article deals with the problem of determination of the peculiarities of legal consequences of invalidity of transactions committed with the use of modern information technologies. The authors believe that the development of modern information technologies has led to the emergence of "new" and "transitional" transactions. The object of the study is completely "new" transactions (for example, IT-transactions that are concluded on the Internet, including using the Blockchain technology) and "transitional transactions", which are only partially different in form and/or manner than traditional ones (for example, electronic transactions, transactions where the object is related to the IT-environment, etc.). As to the consequences of the recognition of transactions invalid, then, in the opinion of the authors, the basis is to take the general model of recognition of invalid transactions, which provides for restitution and compensation for damage. Particular attention should be paid to the recognition of invalid IT-transactions to the "a priori validity" of such transactions, which can create significant risks for users of the blockade software platform and make it difficult to protect their rights in the future. The results obtained is seen in the creation of a new concept of the law in the information society with the development of an appropriate legal mechanism for the protection of the rights of their participants, in particular, the concept of the invalidity of IT-transactions and their legal implications.

   Foods Using Smart Contracts
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB The use of smart contracts and blockchain tokens to implement a consumer trustworthy ingredient certification scheme for commingled foods, i.e., recipe based, food products is described. The proposed framework allows ingredients that carry any desired property (including social or environmental customer perceived value) to be certified by any certification authority, at the moment of harvest or extraction, using the IGR Ethereum token. The mechanism involves the transfer of tokens containing the internet url published at the authority's web site from the farmer all along the supply chain to the final consumer at each transfer of custody of the ingredient using the Cricital Tracking Event/Key Data Elements (CTE/KDE) philosophy of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). This allows the end consumer to easily inspect and be assured of the origin of the ingredient by means of a mobile application. A successful code implementation of the framework was deployed, tested and is running as a beta version on the Ethereum live blockchain as the IGR token. The main contribution of the framework is the possibility to ensure the true origin of any instance or lot of ingredient within a recipe to the customer, without harming the food processor legitimate right to protect its recipes and suppliers.

TI The End of "Corporate' Governance: Hello "Platform' Governance
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB In a technology-driven, digital world, many of the largest and most successful businesses now operate as platforms'. Such firms leverage networked technologies to facilitate economic exchange, transfer information, connect people, and make predictions. Platform companies are already disrupting multiple industries, including retail, hotels, taxis, and others, and are aggressively moving into new sectors, such as financial services. This paper examines the distinctive features of this new business model and its implications for regulation, notably corporate governance. In particular, the paper suggests that a tension exists between the incentives created by modern corporate governance and the business needs of today's platforms. The current regulatory framework promotes an unhealthy corporate' attitude that is failing platforms, and a new direction (what we term platform governance') is urgently required. In identifying this new regulatory direction, the paper considers how firms might develop as successful platforms. Although there is no one-size-fits-all' solution, the paper describes three interconnected strategies: (1) leveraging current and near-future digital technologies to create more community-driven' forms of organization; (2) building an open and accessible platform culture'; and (3) facilitating the creation, curation, and consumption of meaningful content'. The paper concludes that jurisdictions that are the most successful in designing a new platform governance' based on the promotion of these strategies will be the primary beneficiaries of the digital transformation.

TI A survey on blockchain cybersecurity vulnerabilities and possible
   countermeasures
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT
AB Blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer-to-peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.

TI Using Blockchain to Create Transaction Identity for Persons Experiencing
   Homelessness in America: Policy Proposal
SO JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB More than 500,000 people experience homelessness in America each day. Local and federal solutions to the problem have had limited success because of the fragmentation of services and lack of valid and timely information. Billions of dollars spent to provide reliable, timely, and actionable information in health care have exposed the difficulty of establishing such a system using the prevalent information technology solutions. However, relying on successful examples of the use of blockchain to help refugee populations and poor farmers internationally, we have partnered to propose an innovative solution to this problem using the case of people experiencing homelessness in Austin, Texas. This paper aims to describe one of the first applications of blockchain technology for addressing homelessness in the United States by creating a digital identity for people experiencing homelessness and engaging emergency medical services and clinical providers. The authors argue that a lack of documentation to prove personal identity and the inability to access own records are major hurdles for empowering persons experiencing homelessness to be resilient and overcome the life challenges they face. Furthermore, it is argued that this lack of information causes misdiagnosis, duplication, and fragmentation in service delivery, which can be potentially addressed by blockchain technology. Further planning for creating a program on the ground with additional funding will demonstrate the results of using blockchain technology to establish digital identity for persons experiencing homelessness.

AB As the conjuncture of the energetic system in countries or different regions changes, renewable energy sources play a significant role. Thanks to them, it is possible to move from pollute fossil fuels to sustainable use of clean resources. It is widely acknowledged that the use of biomass waste promotes better environmental state and sustainable development because the waste that cannot be recycled is used for energy production. This article describes the usage of blockchain technology-based biomass systems that not only allows tracing the emergence of biomass, but also contributes to the development of sustainable energy. The research shows that a biomass blockchain enables simplification of biomass production process, thus saving resources and contributing to the expansion of forests and the development of common energy system.

TI Blockchain and Trust in a Smart City
SO ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION ASIA
AB Trust in a smart city is fundamental to its transparency, the participation of its people in governance, entrepreneurial initiatives, trade, commerce and hence the growth of its economy. A city gets smart by transforming itself to a digital city, and a digital city runs on data, analytics, internet of things, artificial intelligence and machine learning. This inevitable transformation creates the fundamental need for trust. How does data remain sacrosanct and verifiable? How do people trust institutions? How do institutions trust each other? How do devices trust each other? This article explores blockchain as an essential layer of trust in a smart city. It explains the technology by drawing real-life examples to the 'memory game' that operates in an ecosystem of 'trust and consensus.' The article provides further insight into institutions that can be governed on blockchain through 'smart contracts' in a sovereign and human independent manner. The use cases of blockchain have been corroborated with examples of successful blockchain implementation. The value for blockchain, in general, and smart cities, in particular, has been presented across four categories: (a) the network effect on trust on society, governments and industries; (b) empowering the individual and strengthening the economy; (c) the liquid economy and (d) the shareable economy. Given the current topology of technology innovations, there is no solution better than blockchain that embodies trust. It is a hope and expectation that this article will help smart city planners, developers, architects and thinkers implement blockchain as the embodiment of trust in smart cities that are increasingly becoming digital.

TI Forensic-chain: Blockchain based digital forensics chain of custody with
   PoC in Hyperledger Composer
SO DIGITAL INVESTIGATION
AB Advancements in Information Technology landscape over the past two decades have made the collection, preservation, and analysis of digital evidence an extremely important tool for solving cybercrimes and preparing court cases. Digital evidence plays an important role in cybercrime investigation, as it is used to link individuals with criminal activities. Thus it is of utmost importance to guarantee integrity, authenticity, and auditability of digital evidence as it moves along different levels of hierarchy in the chain of custody during cybercrime investigation. Modern day technology is more advanced in terms of portability and power. A huge amount of information is generated by billions of devices connected to the internet that needs to be stored and accessed, thus posing great challenges in maintaining the integrity and authenticity of digital evidence for its admissibility in the court of law. Handling digital evidences poses unique challenges because of the fact they are latent, volatile, fragile, can cross jurisdictional borders quickly and easily and in many cases can be time/machine dependent too. Thus guaranteeing the authenticity and legality of processes and procedures used to gather and transfer the evidence in a digital society is a real challenge. Blockchain technology's capability of enabling comprehensive view of transactions (events/actions) back to origination provides enormous promise for the forensic community. In this research we proposed Forensic-Chain: A Blockchain based Digital Forensics Chain of Custody, bringing integrity and tamper resistance to digital forensics chain of custody. We also provided Proof of Concept in Hyperledger Composer and evaluated its performance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Research challenges and opportunities in blockchain and cryptocurrencies
SO INTERNET TECHNOLOGY LETTERS
AB The blockchain is the underlying technology of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, and it has created much excitement in the technology and research communities. A blockchain is a distributed ledger collectively maintained by a peer-to-peer network of participants who in Bitcoin are known as miners. This key innovation enables cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to operate in a decentralized manner with no intermediaries such as financial institutions. But the blockchain can be used to record things other than cryptocurrency transactions. While many of the concepts of Bitcoin build on what have been around since the 1980s and 1990s, the designer(s) of it have made important assumptions that make it work along with the use of an incentive protocol, leading to a major breakthrough from traditional academic thinking. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art of blockchain and cryptocurrencies along with research challenges and opportunities that would be of interest to researchers getting into this exciting field.

TI Endorsement in Hyperledger Fabric via service discovery
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) is a modular and extensible permissioned blockchain platform. The platform's design exhibits principles required by enterprise-grade business applications, such as supply chains, financial transactions, asset management, etc. For that end, HLF introduces several innovations, two of which are smart contracts in general-purpose languages (chaincode in HLF), and flexible endorsement policies, which govern whether a transaction is considered valid. Typical blockchain applications comprise two tiers: The "platform" tier defines the data schema and embedding of business rules by means of chaincode and endorsement policies; the "client-side" tier uses the HLF software development kit (SDK) to implement client application logic. The client side should be aware of the deployment address of chaincode and endorsement policies within the platform. In past releases, this was statically configured into the client side. As of HLF v1.2, a new feature called service discovery, presented in this paper, provides APIs that allow dynamic discovery of the configuration required for the client SDK to interact with the platform. This enables the client to rapidly adapt to changes in the platform, thus improving the reliability of the application layer and making the HLF platform more consumable.

SO ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
AB Although the fintech subject has been widely discussed in the press and communications media, there is a lack of consensus on the definition of the term in the scientific literature and the key research topics and trends. Aiming to narrow this gap, the objective of this study is to investigate the concept of fintech, to map the literature and point out new routes and opportunities in the field. For this purpose, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed, attempting to describe the areas of fintech activities, propose a categorization for this literature, highlight the main issues dealt with to date in the sample publications, as well as to point out new questions for continuing research in this field. The results show a set of definitions for the term fintech and suggest as a comprehensive understanding of fintech, as innovative companies active in the financial industry making use of the availability of communication, the ubiquity of the internet, and the automated processing of information. Moreover, the literature focuses on financial services and innovations, dealing with issues of financial industry regulation and local legislation or the financial system globally. The innovation of research subcategories (technology adoption/network externalities), blockchain and security appear with great emphasis in this work and represent the current most sensitive aspects also linked to the more global theme of digital transformation. Finally, subjects related to financial services operation particularly deal with risks of financial loss related to different factors involved in the business environment of these organizations.

AB Keeping up with the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) requires staying up to date on the latest network attack trends in dynamic and complicated cyberspace, and take them into account while developing holistic information security (IS) approaches for the IoT. Due to multiple vulnerabilities in the IoT foundations, many targeted attacks are continuing to evolve. This survey of related work in the very specialized field of IS assurance for the IoT develops a taxonomy of typical attacks against IoT assets (with special attention to IoT device protection). Based on this taxonomy, the key directions for countering these attacks are defined. According to the modern demand for the IoT and big IS-related data processing, we propose applying the Security Intelligence approach. The results obtained, when compared with the related work and numerous analogues, are based on the following research methodology: view the IoT as a security object to be protected, leading to understanding its vulnerabilities and possible attacks against the IoT exploiting these vulnerabilities, and from there approaches to protecting the IoT. A few areas of the future research, among which the IoT operational resilience and usage of the blockchain technology seem to us the most interesting, are indicated.

TI Ignorance, Debt, and Cryptocurrencies: The Old and the New in the Law
   and Economics of Concurrent Currencies
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL REGULATION
AB Cryptocurrencies are expected to have a significant impact on banking, finance, and monetary systems. Due to the uncertainty as to the possible future trajectories of the evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem, governments have taken a relatively hands-off approach to regulating such currencies. This approach may be justified within the theoretical information-economics framework of this paper, which draws parallels between the information economics of money and quasi-money creation within the current central banking, commercial banking, and shadow banking systems with that of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In particular, drawing lessons from the literature on the role of information in creating safe assets', in this paper the authors find that by building on symmetric (common) knowledge as to the inner workings of the Bitcoin Blockchain-though in a different way-bitcoin possesses a degree of endogenous information insensitivity typical of safe assets. This endogenous information insensitivity could support bitcoin's promise of maturing into a viable store of value and a niche medium of exchange. This finding should not be overlooked in the policy discussions for potential future regulatory interventions in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

TI Low risk trading algorithm based on the price cyclicality function for
   capital markets
SO MANAGEMENT & MARKETING-CHALLENGES FOR THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY
AB Buy cheap and sell more expensive is one of the basic ideas of trading the capital markets for hundreds of years. To apply it in practice has become difficult nowadays due to the high price volatility. The uncertainty in the price movements often leads to high-risk allocation. One main question is when the price is low enough for a low-risk entry? Once established an entry point, the second question is how long to keep the open trades in order to optimize the investment efficiency? This article will answer these questions. A general trading algorithm based on the price cyclical behavior will be revealed. The mathematical model is developed using the Price Cyclicality Function combined with other computational techniques in order to establish low-risk intervals. The algorithm will use multiple entry points in order to catch the best price opportunities. A simple empirical exit algorithm will be optimized in order to maximize the profit for a certain capital exposure level. The presented model uses a low number of functional parameters which can be optimized with a reasonable computational effort for any financial market. Trading results obtained for several markets will also be included in this paper in order to reveal the efficiency of the presented methodology. It was found that the Low-Risk Trading Algorithm can be used with good results for algorithmic trading in any financial market. With the right parameters set, this methodology can be wide range applied in the stock markets, currency and cryptocurrency markets, commodities and raw materials markets and even for the real estate investments. The simplicity of the presented model and the good efficiency level obtained will recommend it. This methodology can be used by any investor in order to manage the investment plan with multiple capital markets.

TI Exploring the dynamics of Bitcoin's price: a Bayesian structural time
   series approach
SO EURASIAN ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Currently, there is no consensus on the real properties of Bitcoin. The discussion comprises its use as a speculative or safe haven asset, while other authors argue that the augmented attractiveness could end up accomplishing money's properties that economic theory demands. This paper explores the association between Bitcoin's market price and a set of internal and external factors by employing the Bayesian structural time series approach (BSTS). The idea behind BSTS is to create a superposition of layers such as cycles, trend, and explanatory variables that are allowed to vary stochastically over time, additionally, it is possible to perform a variable selection through the application of the Spike and Slab method. This study aims to contribute to the discussion of Bitcoin price determinants by differentiating among several attractiveness sources and employing a method that provides a more flexible analytic framework that decomposes each of the components of the time series, applies variable selection, includes information on previous studies, and dynamically examines the behavior of the explanatory variables, all in a transparent and tractable setting. The results show that the Bitcoin's price is negatively associated with the price of gold as well as the exchange rate between Yuan and US Dollar, while positively correlated to stock market index, USD to Euro exchange rate and diverse signs among the different countries' search trends.

TI If Rockefeller Were a Coder
SO GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
AB The Ethereum Decentralized Autonomous Organization ("The DAO"), a decentralized, smart-contract-based investment fund with assets of $168 million, spectacularly crashed when one of its members exploited a flaw in its computer code and siphoned off $55 million. In the wake of the exploit, many argued that participants in The DAO could be jointly and severally liable for the loss as partners in a general partnership. Others claimed that The DAO evidenced an entirely new form of business entity, one that current laws do not contemplate. Ultimately, the technologists cleaned up the exploit by restructuring the computer code, and without engaging in any further legal analysis, many simply concluded that The DAO, other decentralized autonomous organizations, and the Ethereum protocol itself signify opportunities to do away with legal business-organizational forms as they presently exist. In this Article, I argue that precisely the opposite is true. Instead of creating a new type of corporate entity through computer code, The DAO and other smart-contract-based organizations may resurrect a very old, frequently forgotten business entity-the business trust-which Rockefeller used to solve the technology-business organization law divide of his time.
   This Article offers the first analysis of blockchain-based business ventures under business organization law at three separate levels of the technology: protocols, smart contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations. The Article first reveals the practical and theoretical deficits of using partnership as the only common-law entity option for blockchain-based business ventures. The Article then demonstrates that incorporation and limited liability company ("LLC") formation will also pose both practical and doctrinal difficulties for some such businesses. When faced with a similar conundrum in the 19th century, Rockefeller turned to the common-law business trust as a substitute business entity. This Article argues that if Rockefeller were a coder building a blockchain-based business, he would again turn to the business trust as his choice of entity. The Article concludes by considering, in light of Rockefeller's history, whether the law should anticipate any challenges with the rise of blockchain-based business trusts.

TI THE SUPPLY CHAIN VALUE OF POD AND PGI FOOD PRODUCTS THROUGH THE
   APPLICATION OF BLOCKCHAIN
SO QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB The agri-food industry is one of the largest in the world and includes all the activities aimed at the production, processing and distribution of food products. Food, culture and fashion are among the elements that characterize Italy in the world. The Mediterranean diet, its products and its dishes are imitated in every part of the globe with "Italian sounding" products. The economic data for 2017 show that the PDO and PGI production in Italy have a value of 15.2 billion euro, equal to 18% of the total turnover of the national agri-food sector. On the export front, the Made in Italy quality production continues to grow, reaching (SIC) 8.8 billion in 2017, accounting for 21% of Italian agri-food exports.
   The complexity and the value of the agri-food chain are the reasons behind the technology sector, and in particular of blockchainbased projects. The focus on the food market must be sought in the challenges it faces such as the fight against fraud and counterfeiting, food security and the redistribution of value along the supply chain.
   It is not only the need for transparency, however, that makes the agri-food sector an ideal ally of blockchain technology. Historically, the food production sector and, in particular, agricultural products, have been characterized by the presence of small and mediumsized producers, characterized by their low bargaining power. Within this context, the blockchain can play a leading role in the exchange of goods and services that make it possible to democratize the supply process, making the relationship between small farmers and big buyers fairer.

TI A Primer for Information Technology General Control Considerations on a
   Private and Permissioned Blockchain Audit
SO CURRENT ISSUES IN AUDITING
AB Blockchain is a disruptive technology that offers advantages to the audit profession such as transparency into all transactions, an immutable ledger, and the potential for real-time auditing. However, to realize these benefits, the profession must be prepared to gain comfort over blockchains as a component of organizations' information technology infrastructure. This paper considers risks to private and permissioned blockchains through the lens of information technology general controls (ITGCs) as part of an audit of internal control over financial reporting. I discuss new ITGC areas of focus for auditors to consider, along with areas of risk that blockchain could eliminate. To help readers better understand this emerging topic, I provide illustrations, a summary table of key points, and a glossary of blockchain-related terms used throughout the paper. This paper should be viewed as a primer of ITGC considerations on blockchain audits, as more nuanced concerns will emerge as the technology evolves.

TI Interview with Bruce G. Carruthers. Brexit, Bitcoin, Big Data: How
   Historical Analysis Helps Shed Light on What the Future Holds
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC SOCIOLOGY-EKONOMICHESKAYA SOTSIOLOGIYA
AB Bruce G. Carruthers, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Sociology at North-western University was interviewed by Mayya Shmidt, master's student at Stockholm University, during his visit to the Swedish Collegium for Advanced Study based in Uppsala.
   During the first part of the conversation, Bruce Carruthers reflects upon the structural differences between European and North American academic settings and between sociological departments and business schools, considering graduate training and further ascending up the career ladder. He elaborates on his current research, a historical study of credit and credit decision-making in the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but he also works on corporate social responsibility and taxation and the adoption of "business like" characteristics by US museums. Carruthers points out that working at a bunch of intersections between different branches of sociology allows him to be intellectually inclusive in his work. He shares his personal recipe for economic sociology. According to him, a good economic sociologist has to be curious about the economy and willing to do additional work and go beyond his or her sociological training to become knowledgeable in economic phenomena. Taking advantage of communication with colleagues from other fields of knowledge may also contribute to a good practice of conducting an economic sociological study.
   Speculating about the future of credit relations, Carruthers suggests that dystopian sci-fi TV shows pose some relevant issues to credit scoring. The combination of how widely the information can circulate and what the individual scores are based on provoke governmentality fears about ratings and rankings. As he puts it, the developing Chinese social credit system, which involves almost no privacy in relation to the State, may be nerve-racking if it gets full expression-quite the opposite future Carruthers predicts for the peer-to-peer platforms that promised to challenge the financial market. Once the promotional hype is over, as he points out, big financial institutions will likely take over the successful platforms, and tech platforms could do the business of intermediation may pop up.
   With respect to promising topics in sociology, Carruthers recommends directing our attention toward the incorporation of big data into research and the expansion of big data analysis skills, as the future of economic sociological research lies therein.

TI Toward a Distributed Carbon Ledger for Carbon Emissions Trading and
   Accounting for Corporate Carbon Management
SO JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN ACCOUNTING
AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control requires coordinated efforts and collaboration at all levels of governmental bodies, non-for-profit organizations, and private sectors. However, the target is difficult to achieve due to challenges arising from conflicts of interest and lack of trust between stakeholders. Thus, we propose a distributed carbon ledger (DCL) system using blockchain technology. Our analysis suggests that the adoption of DCL not only strengthens the corporate accounting system for carbon asset management but also fits within existing market-based emissions trading schemes (ETSs). Blockchain-enabled DCL allows the integration of national emission trading schemes (ETSs) and corporate carbon asset management into a synthetic single mechanism.

TI Automatic smart contract generation using controlled natural language
   and template
SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Smart contracts, which are widely recognized as key components of blockchain technology, enable automatic execution of agreements. Since each smart contract is a computer program that autonomously runs on a blockchain platform, their development requires much effort and care compared with the development of more common programs. In this paper, we propose a technique to automatically generate a smart contract from a human-understandable contract document that is created using a document template and a controlled natural language (CNL). The automation is based on a mapping from the document template and the CNL to a formal model that can define the terms and conditions in a contract including temporal constraints and procedures. The formal model is then translated into an executable smart contract. We implemented a toolchain that generates smart contracts of Hyperledger Fabric from template-based contract documents via a formal model. We then evaluated the feasibility of our approach through case studies of two types of real-world contracts in different domains.

TI Blockchain and Smart Contracting for the Shareholder Community
SO EUROPEAN BUSINESS ORGANIZATION LAW REVIEW
AB Current shareholder engagement systems face large classical inefficiencies. First, due to the large chains of intermediaries in the current securities models, transaction costs are high and shareholder votes and other information are not always correctly transmitted between shareholders and issuers. Recent cases including DNick Holding and T. Rowe Price show the absurdness' of the current systems. The Shareholder Rights Directive II addresses these problems and the Implementing Regulation already hints at modern technologies to increase the transparency and verifiability of shareholder engagement. Next, the current shareholder engagement system enables different opportunities for different types of shareholders, creating inequalities and hindering shareholder democracy. The solution to these substantial problems lies in a state-of-the-art technology: in this contribution we argue that blockchain technology can solve these current inefficiencies that shareholders and companies face. Using a permissioned blockchain, information can be stored in a verifiable and immutable way, with a consensus mechanism tailored to its purpose. The large amount of initiatives and prototypes of blockchain proxy voting and trading, including the legislative initiatives that were initiated in the past 2years, show the merits of using this state-of-the-art technology. The Europe Union should incorporate this technology in its legislation, like the CSD regulation, for remaining technology-proof in this globalized market.

SO IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Enterprise Blockchain network solutions facilitate the extension and optimization of processes across organizational boundaries. This increased level of sharing provides greater visibility, provenance of transactions to all parties involved, and reduces friction that arises due to organizational boundaries. Blockchain Solution Reference Architecture (BSRA) provides comprehensive guidance to architect and build end-to-end solutions based on Blockchain technologies. BSRA was primarily developed based on client engagements across industries such as retail, financial, supply chain, and telco, and addresses two major parts of a Blockchain solution: 1) building a Blockchain business network that receives, builds, and shares blocks in a secure manner; and 2) onboarding members on to the business network with the appropriate level of access and collaboration privileges. BSRA provides a foundational set of architectural artifacts that can help accelerate development of solutions based on Blockchain technologies. It also provides a starter list of architectural decisions that every project will have to set during development.

Since Bitcoin created, many other electronic currencies have been developed. We propose a protocol for an electronic currency for making anonymous payments that can be supervised by an auditor, who has sole access to the transaction history. Other electronic currencies provide only anonymity, which is convenient for making illegal transactions without regulation. For users, miners, and banks, the transactions of our electronic currency are anonymous, and only auditors can see how it is used. We make use of POW (prove-of-work) technique that allows for distributed decisionmaking within a network, namely the Bitcoin blockchain protocol. We combine the POW and blockchain technology of Bitcoin to give better protection against double-spending attacks.

Accompanied by the price volatility of bitcoins from 2017 to 2018, blockchain has been a hot word on the internet, and particularly hot in China. Blockchain offers a distributed and secure system for data storage and value transactions. Its applications are springing up in multiple fields.
   The Chinese government is considering these trends with great caution. Initial coin offering has been banned in China since September 2017. By contrast, an official white paper on China's blockchain technology, which was released in May 2018, said that blockchain technology will be widely applied in the real economy of China within 3 years. In a recent panel discussion held by National Science Review, experts talked about related topics. Their opinions may provide a quick view of the future development of blockchain in China and abroad.

TI A Decentralized and Non-reversible Traceability System for Storing
   Commodity Data
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB In the field of traceability systems, researchers focus on applications in the agricultural food traceability and scanning commodities. The purposes of this paper, however, is to propose an efficient and reliable traceability system that can be applied to all kinds of commodities. Currently, most traceability systems store data in a central server, which is unreliable when the system is under attack or if the administrator tampers with the data for personal interests. Therefore, it is necessary to design a system that can eliminate these threats. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and non-reversible traceability system for storing commodity data. This system depends on blockchain technology, which organizes data in the form of chains without a central server. This chain-style storage mechanism can prevent malicious modifications. In addition, some strategies are adopted to reduce the storage pressure and response time when the system has stored all kinds of commodity data.

TI A secure message-passing framework for inter-vehicular communication
   using blockchain
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Due to exponential growth in the daily usage of vehicles, the traffic congestion and roadside accidents are increasing day by day. The communication among vehicles is critical to avoid the emergencies and to address the issue of congestion of vehicles. Internet of vehicles provides the communication channel between the vehicles, but existing solutions require a centralized communication system to distribute the message and to authenticate the source. This centralized infrastructure is subject to disturb the vehicular communication in case of server breakdown or due to any natural disaster where hardware stops working. Also, the centralized system proves to be costly as the communication of each vehicle necessitates access to the central server resulting in the more resource requirement. A secure distributed system is required to avoid the emergencies and reduce the traffic rate. To address the issues, we proposed a secure distributed message-passing framework that does not require a centralized server, and it rates the credibility of message source using blockchain technology. The messages in the proposed system are forwarded through dedicated short-range communication protocol. To validate the proposed system, we have performed different simulations using SUMO, OMNET, and VEINS. The results demonstrated an increase in the average speed of vehicles that showed a reduced congestion rate. Moreover, our system identified the malicious vehicles with 77.1% accuracy.

AB The detection of informational leadership is a core issue in financial market microstructure. We use effective group transfer entropy (EGTE) as a measure for the predictability of a stochastic process using lagged observations on multiple related processes within the same system. We propose an appropriate bootstrap to derive confidence bounds and show by means of a simulation study that standard linear approaches in economics and finance, such as vector autoregressions and Granger-causality tests, are not well suited to detect information transfer. We empirically examine the markets for cryptocurrencies using intraday data and reveal that the dependencies are mostly of nonlinear nature, highlighting the applicability of EGTE in the context of this new financial product.

TI Brief, Daily Training Using a Mobile App Help Change Maladaptive
   Beliefs? Crossover Randomized Controlled Trial
SO JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB Background: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disabling condition with a wide variety of clinical presentations including contamination fears, fear of harm, and relationship-related obsessions. Cognitive behavioral models of OCD suggest that OC symptoms result from catastrophic misinterpretations of commonly occurring intrusive experiences and associated dysfunctional strategies used to manage them. OCD-related maladaptive beliefs including inflated responsibility, importance and control of thoughts, perfectionism, and intolerance for uncertainty increase the likelihood of such misinterpretations.
   Objective: Considering accumulating evidence suggesting that mobile health (mHealth) apps based on cognitive-behavioral principles may lead to significant reductions in psychopathological symptoms, we assessed the effectiveness of a novel cognitive training app (GGRO) designed to challenge OCD-related beliefs.
   Methods: A total of 97 students were randomized to groups undertaking immediate-use (iApp) or delayed use (dApp) of GGRO. All participants were requested to complete Web-based assessments, with questionnaires relating to maladaptive beliefs, mood, and OC symptoms at baseline (T1), 15 days from baseline (T2), and 30 days from baseline (T3). Participants in iApp group started using the app at baseline and continued using the app for 15 consecutive days. They were then requested to stop using the app until T3. Participants in the dApp group were requested to wait for 15 days and only then start using the app (crossover) for 15 consecutive days.
   Results: All participants used the app for a mean of 14.07 (SD 1.41) days with 2.94 levels per day. Consistent with previous findings, app use was associated with medium-large effect size reductions in both iApp (n=51) and dApp (n=46) groups. In the iApp group, all effects remained significant during the 15 days of follow-up. Analyses focusing on the first two assessment occasions revealed significant treatment x repeated measures interactions on maladaptive beliefs, several OC symptom measures, and self-esteem.
   Conclusions: This study provides further evidence for the efficacy of GGRO as a mobile-delivered training exercise that is useful for reducing OCD-related beliefs and symptoms.

SO JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS
AB The six personality disorder (PD) types in DSM-5 section III are intended to resemble their DSM-IV/DSM-5 section II PD counterparts, but are now described by the level of personality functioning (criterion A) and an assigned trait profile (criterion B). However, concerns have been raised about the validity of these PD types. The present study examined the continuity between the DSM-IV/DSM-5 section II PDs and the corresponding trait profiles of the six DSM-5 section III PDs in a sample of 350 Dutch psychiatric patients. Facets of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) were presumed as representations (proxies) of the DSM-5 section III traits. Correlational patterns between the DAPP-BQ and the six PDs were consistent with previous research between DAPP-BQ and DSM-IV PDs. Moreover, DAPP-BQ proxies were able to predict the six selected PDs. However, the assigned trait profile for each PD didn't fully match the corresponding PD.

TI E-Commerce Liability and Security Breaches in Mobile Payment for
   e-Business Sustainability
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB This study investigates liability issues in electronic transactions when security or privacy breaches occur. As data is transferred using various devices, such as PCs, mobile phones, tablets, sensors, smart meters, and cars, and various architecture, such as the cloud, IoT, as well as in well-defined network structures in electronic commerce, privacy and security breaches happen. These have become a major hindrance to the development and use of commercial activities on the Internet. There have been many security breach cases, such as those of Target Corporation's security and payment system (2013), eBay's cyberattack (2014), Uber's hacking incident (2016), Facebook's personal data use and privacy breach (2018), and many others. Therefore, when a dispute regarding electronic transactions arises between a customer and a firm, the allocation of liability is very important for the sustainability of e-businesses. Many cases show that firms are held liable for those incidents. However, the liability allocation rule tends to vary slightly from country to country depending on the application areas. EU countries seem to favor customers. In the United States, there are actually no uniform federal laws relating to business cybersecurity. Also, in the case of cryptocurrency, liability tends to lie with customers. Why is the ruling different? In this regard, this paper analyses the legal framework for security and privacy breaches for sustainable e-businesses. In particular, this paper focuses on the optimal liability in terms of enhancing social welfare when considering both sidesthe customer and the firm (or service provider). This paper shows that liability can be generally imposed on the firm's side when the possibility of security or privacy breaches is high, and the customer's loss is relatively large. However, the liability depends on the customer's attitude towards risk, customer's losses, and the efficiency of security investment.

AB Smart contracts, self-executing agreements based on blockchain technology, have the capacity to create trust in what we term no-trust contracting environments. We argue that using them in such environments is the path to unleash the full potential of smart contracts. Compared to the contract enforcement mechanisms characterized by traditional contract law or relational contracts, smart contracts can offer a superior solution for facilitating trade.
   Several lawyers and economists have debated whether smart contracts might offer the prospect of cheaper, faster and better transactions. As we discuss below, contract law scholars caution that they neither replicate the relational context essential for the day-to-day practice of contracting nor offer a superior solution to problems addressed by traditional contract law, such as contract validity and legality. We clarify and systematize the current thinking on the legal nature and reliability of smart contracts, and address the concerns of contract law scholars. While doing that, we suggest a step forward in characterizing contracting environments, contract enforcement mechanisms and the trust relationship underlying contracts.

TI Blockchains from a Distributed Computing Perspective
SO COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM
AB BITCOIN FIRST APPEARED in a 2008 white paper authored by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto,(18) the mysterious deus absconditus of the blockchain world. Today, cryptocurrencies and blockchains are very much in the news. Much of this coverage is lurid, sensationalistic, and irresistible: roller-coaster prices and instant riches, vast sums of money stolen or inexplicably lost, underground markets for drugs and weapons, and promises of libertarian utopias just around the corner. This article is a tutorial on the basic notions and mechanisms underlying blockchains, colored by the perspective that much of the blockchain world is a disguised, sometimes distorted, mirror image of the distributeda computing world.

TI Consumers contracting with other consumers in the sharing economy: fill
   in the gaps in the legal framework or switch to the blockchain model?
SO IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS
AB Numerous legal provisions were enacted at an EU level in order to protect consumers contracting with professionals, especially in a digital environment (see, in particular, the protection measures provided by directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights; directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices; directive 2000/31/EC on electronic commerce, etc.). With the development of the web 2.0 and the so-called "sharing economy", consumers are now entitled to easily conclude agreements with other consumers through intermediation platforms. EU Consumer Acquis shall normally be applicable to the relationship between the platform and each of the peers (the seller or the provider on one hand, and the buyer or the recipient on the other hand), with the exclusion of C2C relationships.
   The objective of this paper is to highlight the potential issues and gaps in the context of consumer protection (lack of information, warranty issues, no right of withdrawal, etc.), resulting from the fact that C2C agreements are normally out of scope of the EU Consumer Acquis (and only governed by the traditional contract law). Some propositions de lege ferenda will also be made, in order to ensure a higher level of consumer protection (with additional legal duties prescribed for the intermediaries, for instance). Blockchain technology and smart contracts shall also be taken into account, since they should normally give rise to a "disintermediation" process. It should however be assessed whether or not consumer protection will benefit from this disintermediation.

TI Comparing stakeholder incentives across state-of-the-art renewable
   support mechanisms
SO RENEWABLE ENERGY
AB Traditional support policies for green energy have greatly contributed to the rise in prosumer numbers. However, it is believed that they will soon start to exert negative impact on stakeholders and on the grid. Policy makers advise to phase out two of the most widely applied policies - net metering and feed-in tariff, in favor of support policies that scale better with rising renewable generation. This work quantifies the impact of these traditional policies in future "what-if" scenarios and confirms the need for their replacement. Based on simulations with real data, we compare net metering and feed-in tariff to four state-of-the-art market-based mechanisms, which involve auction, negotiation and bitcoin-like currency. The paper examines the extent to which each of these mechanisms motivates not only green energy production but also its consumption. The properties and characteristics of the above mechanisms are evaluated from the perspective of key stakeholders in the low voltage grid - prosumers, consumers and energy providers. The outcome of this study sheds light on current and future issues that are relevant for policy makers in the evolving landscape of the smart grid. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB "Twister," developed by Miguel Freitas, is a social network platform centered around micro-blogging, much like Twitter. However, rather than relying on centralized servers owned and maintained by a single firm, Twister users operate a blockchain combined with distributed hash table (DHT)-like and BitTorrent-like protocols to both make posts and send private messages, and also to receive entries from other users. Twister's raison d'etre is that it offers a social networking platform that cannot be censored and cannot itself censor. The software does not record the Internet Protocol addresses users use to access the service, nor does it notify other users of an account's online/offline status. Growing adoption of blockchain services means that it is possible that the concept of decentralized social networks could become a norm. It is suggested in this article that blockchain-based peer-to-peer social networks present challenges to the current counterextremist practices for content removal and censorship. While there are methods to disrupt usage of blockchain-based peer-to-peer services, these approaches may have the net harm of curtailing bona fide use of legal and novel technologies. Given this opportunity cost, non-transitory online violent extremist content may need to be tolerated.

TI Observed Differences Between Lab and Online Tests Using the AttrakDiff
   Semantic Differential Scale
SO JOURNAL OF USABILITY STUDIES
AB Online usability testing has long been of interest to usability engineers and designers. Previous studies found that online tests are as good as lab tests in measuring user performance, but not in finding usability problems. However, little is known about measuring the hedonic quality of user experience, such as joy, beauty, and attractiveness, in online tests. In this study, we conducted a systematic empirical comparison between lab and online testing using AttrakDiff, a validated semantic differential scale that measures pragmatic and hedonic quality of user experience. In our study, 32 participants were divided into three groups: lab testing with moderators, lab testing without moderators, and online testing. The participants performed tasks on a prototype of a cryptocurrency application and evaluated the prototype using the AttrakDiff questionnaire. The results showed a significant difference between lab and online tests in hedonic quality, but no difference was found in pragmatic quality. The difference was only between lab and online tests; the presence or absence of moderators in the lab tests did not produce any significant difference. We also found that the participants in online tests offered longer and more detailed free-comment feedback than the participants in lab tests. These results indicate a possible difference between lab and online tests concerning the measurement of the hedonic quality of user experience, as well as the prospect of using online tests to get rich user feedback.

Recently Blockchain has received special attention and is used as a new platform for digital information and to store encrypted data and process secure digital transactions. Noticeably, the majority of Blockchain cryptocurrency is structured based on the elliptic curves digital signature algorithm (ECDSA). In particular, Bitcoin uses special ECDSA called secp256k1. Losses of personal and organizational data occurred due to security breaches of data at small and large scales using traditional transactional and financial platforms. Furthermore, data on Blockchain and Bitcoin platforms are assumed to be highly encrypted and in secured state.

TI The blockchain boom and its real possibilities of application in the
   records of Public Administrations
SO IDP-INTERNET LAW AND POLITICS
AB Blockchain or DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) provides any object with a permanent digital identity over time, regardless of its nature. Beyond its success in the financial sphere, its applications in public administration seem to be extensive and disruptive, especially in terms of the registration of different types of assets - and the European Union may be one of its main drivers. However, this technology is still at a very early stage and the current literature tends to highlight its potential benefits, without analyzing its implementation or limitations in a systematic way. It is also costly to find examples of consolidated projects at a governmental level, mostly due to the regulatory reform that must precede their full adoption.
   This article focuses on this issue, gathering a compendium of real-use cases related to identity and property registers, based on blockchain technology, in countries such as Estonia, Sweden and the United States. Based on this analysis, and applying a functional and technical classification, it attempts to infer its different operating schemes and to extract both its benefits and, especially, its main implications and challenges within the current legal framework. It adopts a technical-legal perspective and pays special attention to aspects such as smart contracts.

SO ECONOMIC NOTES
AB In this paper, by using econometric techniques we provide evidence that bitcoin exhibited the formation of speculative bubble in 2017. To conceptually rationalize the results, we delve into the extant theoretical approaches developed by Kindleberger's (1978) speculative bubbles and Minsky's (1992) financial instability hypothesis. Certainly, bitcoin has spurred a revolution in payment technology that, if treated cautiously can facilitate financial intermediation and inclusion. Ultimately, whether or not bitcoin constitutes a bubble is a decision for investors as the road to hell is paved with good promises.

TI Modulation of Cu2+ Binding to Sphingosine-1-Phosphate by Lipid Charge
SO LANGMUIR
AB Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid metabolite that is thought to participate in the regulation of many physiological processes and may play a key role in several diseases. Herein, we found that Cu2+ binds tightly to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) containing SIP. Specifically, we demonstrated via fluorescence assays that Cu2+-S1P binding was bivalent and sensitive to the concentration of SO in the SLB. In fact, the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, K-DApp, tightened by a factor of 132 from 4.5 mu M to 34 nM as the S1P density was increased from 5.0 to 20 mol %. A major driving force for this apparent tightening was the more negative surface potential with increasing S1P concentration. This potential remained unaltered upon Cu2+ binding at pH 7.4 because two protons were released for every Cu2+ that bound. At pH 5.4, however, Cu2+ could not outcompete protons for the amine and no binding occurred. Moreover, at pH 9.4, the amine was partially deprotonated before Cu2+ binding and the surface potential became more positive on binding. The results for Cu2+-S1P binding were reminiscent of those for Cu2+ phosphatidylserine binding, where a carboxylate group helped to deprotonate the amine. In the case of SIP, however, the phosphate needed to bear two negative charges to facilitate amine deprotonation in the presence of Cu2+.

AB Based on disruptive innovation and Stackelberg noncooperative game theory, the paper focuses on supply chain coordination under the combined effects of block chain technology and random demand. Firstly, both a decentralized and a centralized supply chain decision models are built in a single-cycle newsvendor random demand situation. Then, through revenue sharing contract the study designs a brand-new supply chain coordination model which is Del trust, decentralized, and traded anonymously. Furthermore, the numerical comparative analysis on the optimal decision and supply chain coordination are conducted. It is found that the whole supply chain revenue can achieve and even beyond the performance level of the centralized supply chain with effectively expanding sales market and reducing supply chain risk. When the retail price is stable and supply chain is coordinated with revenue sharing mechanism, decentralized supply chain can achieve minimum optimal revenue. Coordination results have effect on short-term revenues of block chain members only. Implications and suggestions for future research in supply chain coordination are provided.

TI Following the cyber money trail Global challenges when investigating
   ransomware attacks and how regulation can help
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how global regulation of cryptocurrencies and other cybercurrencies can assist in addressing the challenges of attribution when investigating ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime using these payment methods. Design/methodology/approach A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months.

AB Purpose This study aims to compare investors of major conventional currencies and Bitcoin (BTC) investors by using the value at risk (VaR) method common risk measure. Design/methodology/approach The paper used a risk analysis named as VaR. The analysis has various computations that Historical Simulation and Monte Carlo Simulation methods were used for this paper. Findings Findings of the analysis are assessed in two different aspects of singular currency risk and portfolios built. First, BTC is found to be significantly risky with respect to the major currencies; and it is six times riskier than the singular most risky currency. Second, in terms of inclusion of BTC into a portfolio, which equally weights all currencies, it elevates overall portfolio risk by 98 per cent. Practical implications - In spite of the remarkable risk level, it could be considered that investors are desirous of making an investment on BTC could mitigate their overall exposed risk relatively by building a portfolio. Originality/value The paper questions the risk level of Bitcoin, which is a digital currency. BTC, a matter of debate in the contemporary period, is seen as a digital currency free from control or supervision of a regulatory board. With the comparison of major currencies and BTC shows that how could be risky of a financial instrument without regulations. However, there is some advice for investors who would like to invest digital currencies despite the risk level in this study.

TI Towards Analyzing the Complexity Landscape of Solidity Based Ethereum
   Smart Contracts
SO TECHNOLOGIES
AB Blockchain-based decentralized cryptocurrency platforms are currently one of the hottest topics in technology. Although most of the interest is generated by cryptocurrency related activities, it is becoming apparent that a much wider spectrum of applications can leverage the blockchain technology. The primary concepts enabling such general use of the blockchain are the so-called smart contracts, which are special programs that run on the blockchain. One of the most popular blockchain platforms that supports smart contracts is Ethereum. As smart contracts typically handle money, ensuring their low number of faults and vulnerabilities are essential. To aid smart contract developers and help to mature the technology, we need analysis tools and studies for smart contracts. As an initiative for this, we propose the adoption of some well-known OO metrics for Solidity smart contracts. Furthermore, we analyze more than 40 thousand Solidity source files with our prototype tool. The results suggest that smart contract programs are short, neither overly complex nor coupled too much, do not rely heavily on inheritance, and either quite well-commented or not commented at all. Moreover, smart contracts could benefit from an external library and dependency management mechanism, as more than 85% of the defined libraries in Solidity files code the same functionalities.

TI Insights from Testing a Modified Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways
   Approach for Spatial Planning at the Municipal Level
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach has successfully been used to manage uncertainties in large infrastructure projects. However, the viability of the DAPP approach for spatial planning in smaller municipal settings is not clear. This paper examines opportunities and constraints of using adaptive pathways approaches to help small municipalities plan for future sea-level rise. The methodology was based on developing a simplified DAPP-approach, which was tested in a multiple experimental case study of spatial planning projects in three municipalities in Sweden. The results show that the approach promoted vulnerability-based thinking among the end-users and generated new ideas on how to manage the uncertain long-term impacts of future sea-level rise. However, the increased understanding of uncertainties was used to justify static, rather than adaptive, solutions. This somewhat surprising outcome can be explained by perceived legal constraints, lack of experience of adaptive pathways, and unwillingness to prescribe actions that could prove difficult to enforce in the future. More research is needed to further understand at what planning phases dynamic policy pathway approaches work best and how current barriers in legislation, practices, mind-set, organization, and resources can be overcome.

TI A Bitcoin-inspired infinite-server model with a random fluid limit
SO STOCHASTIC MODELS
AB The synchronization process inherent to the Bitcoin network gives rise to an infinite-server model with the unusual feature that customers interact. Among the closed-form characteristics that we derive for this model is the busy period distribution which, counterintuitively, does not depend on the arrival rate. We explain this by exploiting the equivalence between two specific service disciplines, which is also used to derive the model's stationary distribution. Next to these closed-form results, the second major contribution concerns an asymptotic result: a fluid limit in the presence of service delays. Since fluid limits arise under scalings of the law-of-large-numbers type, they are usually deterministic, but in the setting of the model discussed in this paper the fluid limit is random (more specifically, of growth-collapse type).

TI A combinatorial-probabilistic analysis of bitcoin attacks
SO JOURNAL OF DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
AB In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto famously invented bitcoin, and in his (or her, or their, or its) white paper sketched an approximate formula for the probability of a successful double spending attack by a dishonest party. This was corrected by Meni Rosenfeld, who, under more realistic assumptions, gave the exact probability (missing a foundational proof); and another formula (along with foundational proof), in terms of the Incomplete Beta function, was given later by Cyril Grunspan and Ricardo Perez-Marco, that enabled them to derive an asymptotic formula for that quantity. Using Wilf-Zeilberger algorithmic proof theory, we continue in this vein and present a recurrence equation for the above-mentioned probability of success, that enables a very fast compilation of these probabilities. We next use this recurrence to derive (in algorithmic fashion) higher-order asymptotic formulas, extending the formula of Grunspan and Perez-Marco who did the leading term. We then study the statistical properties (expectation, variance, etc.) of the duration of a successful attack.

However, cryptojacking injection presents a paradigm shift to web-based crypto-mining attacks in that it eliminates the need for a pivotal third-party such as the exploitable web server. Thus, instead of attacking credit card and other private information of e-commerce users, attackers seek to maliciously abuse a victim's CPU to generate cryptocurrency. In this paper, we investigate and evaluate cryptojacking injection - a state-of-the-art web-centric attack vector in the crypto-mining attacks landscape. We formulate an attack model based on finite state machines which depicts the various breaches of confidentiality, integrity and availability in the web system as the attack progresses. We show how this new attack vector attacks some of the core components of e-commerce (URL, HTTP and HTML) to generate Monero crypto currency from benign web users. We evaluate our modeling approach with a series of experiments with two attack scenarios using different operating systems. Results show that the attack is indeed cross-platform and feasible on any operating system of a browser-capable device. We analyze the generated network traffic during the attack and draw features such as URLs and the parsed files, the associated cryptographic hashes, and the IP addresses of the crypto-mining domains. These, together with host-based features such as exhaustive CPU usage can be used as indicators of compromise and subsequently act as feed into intrusion detection systems.

TI A Review of Fog Computing and Machine Learning: Concepts, Applications,
   Challenges, and Open Issues
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Systems based on fog computing produce massive amounts of data; accordingly, an increasing number of fog computing apps and services are emerging. In addition, machine learning (ML), which is an essential area, has gained considerable progress in various research domains, including robotics, neuromorphic computing, computer graphics, natural language processing (NLP), decision-making, and speech recognition. Several researches have been proposed that study how to employ ML to settle fog computing problems. In recent years, an increasing trend has been observed in adopting ML to enhance fog computing applications and provide fog services, like efficient resource management, security, mitigating latency and energy consumption, and traffic modeling. Based on our understanding and knowledge, there is no study has yet investigated the role of ML in the fog computing paradigm. Accordingly, the current research shed light on presenting an overview of the ML functions in fog computing area. The ML application for fog computing become strong end-user and high layers services to gain profound analytics and more smart responses for needed tasks. We present a comprehensive review to underline the latest improvements in ML techniques that are associated with three aspects of fog computing: management of resource, accuracy, and security. The role of ML in edge computing is also highlighted. Moreover, other perspectives related to the ML domain, such as types of application support, technique, and dataset are provided. Lastly, research challenges and open issues are discussed.

AB This paper discusses the use of Blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) in the healthcare domain, identifying areas where current processes can be enhanced through the use of these new digital technologies while highlighting the issues these early developments present for an industry that is averse to risk, yet open to new technologies that improve patient safety and survival. The report discusses two uses of IoT with Blockchain as examples for the industry with many other possibilities being adoptable in a proposed single architecture that would integrate industry procedures to a common platform. While identifying technological improvements to the industry the paper also identifies the practical aspects of such a development, with varying interests across the sector, restricted funds and advancing computing power all being significant factors in whether and how to invest in such technologies.
   With reference to other industry attempts to make improved decisions from IoT technologies, the necessity for industry representation and leadership is seen as a significant factor in the success of any large-scale industry-wide development of a size where significant industry improvements would be achieved. While small scale isolated projects can assist individual institutions the savings industry-wide from these is likely to be much less significant than a single platform addressing total industry issues, however, the complexity in achieving this is not to be underestimated. A government body or the healthcare industry, is potentially required to coordinate the design and implementation, compiling the scope and design documentation with funding and development/implementation being provided for the industry as a whole.
   The paper concludes that the technologies can offer considerable technical advantages to healthcare but these are in the early stages of development. The opportunities and requirements for healthcare are significant and need early consideration and industry coordination, using existing network developments as a basis for healthcare platform designs and developed specifically to address the needs of the industry.

TI Ethereum Blockchain Network Implementation for IoT Platform
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED ENGINEERING
AB Internet of things (IoT) is becoming increasingly important and ubiquitous in home and industries. It makes object a part of the Internet and fuses the digital and physical world together. However, if not properly secured, IoT device can be vulnerable to tampering that can change the content of the data stored in the network. Blockchain, a technology used in cryptocurrency, can be used for addressing the security and privacy challenges in IoT. Blockchain can be beneficial to IoT by adding more security layer and reducing dependency on a central authority. This paper proposed to develop a blockchain based platform for IoT application. Blockchain technology can be utilized to provide a decentralized network, creating a more secured IoT system. The proposed blockchain network will be based on Ethereum blockchain network allowing the use smart contract application for management of loT devices. Experiment is conducted to show the feasibility of the blockchain based platform. The proposed blockchain based platform is capable of managing several IoT devices connected to the network.

AB A noble multi-factor authentication (MFA) algorithm is developed for the security enhancement of the Cryptocurrency (CR). The main goal of MFA is to set up extra layer of safeguard while seeking access to a targets such as physical location, computing device, network or database. MFA security scheme requires more than one method for the validation from commutative family of credentials to verify the user for a transaction. MFA can reduce the risk of using single level password authentication by introducing additional factors of authentication. MFA can prevent hackers from gaining access to a particular account even if the password is compromised. The superfluous layer of security introduced by MFA offers additional security to a user. MFA is implemented by using time-based one-time password (TOTP) technique. For logging to any entity with MFA enabled, the user first needs username and password, as a second factor, the user then needs the MFA token to virtually generate a TOTP. It is found that MFA can provide a better means of secured transaction of CR.

AB In this paper, we analyze the suitability of the methods available today for securely managing the wide variety of data produced by the manufacturing sector. We propose a hybrid information architecture for manufacturing, based on decentralized blockchains, cloud-based WORM storage and ordinary cloud storage. We point out shortcomings in the technology available today for realizing this architecture. In particular, we identify a need for low-cost IoT-based systems to capture, identify, preprocess, encrypt and transmit factory floor data to the corresponding data storage subsystems. We describe our proof-of-concept implementation of such an IoT system, along with the factory case study that inspired it, and argue that this system is sufficiently inexpensive to be retrofitted into today's factories.

AB Wireless Virtualization (WiVi) is emerging as a new paradigm to provide high speed communications and meet Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements of users while reducing the deployment cost of wireless infrastructure for future wireless networks. In WiVi, Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs) sublease their RF channels through slicing to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) based on their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the MVNOs independently provide wireless services to their end users. This paper investigates the wireless network virtualization by leveraging both Blockchain technology and machine learning to optimally allocate wireless resources. To eliminate double spending (aka over-committing) of WIPs' wireless resources such as RF channels, Blockchain - a distributed ledger - technology is used where a reputation is used to penalize WIPs with past double spending habit. The proposed reputation based approach helps to minimize extra delay caused by double spending attempts and Blockchain operations. To optimally predict the QoS requirements of MVNOs for their users, linear regression - a machine learning approach - is used that helps to minimize the latency introduced due to (multiple wrong) negotiations for SLAs. The performance evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out by using numerical results obtained from simulations. Results have shown that the joint Blockchain and machine learning based approach outperforms the other approaches.

AB Data Dissemination is the distribution of data/statistics to the end users. With the adoption of Internet of Drones (IoD) environment for data dissemination, an efficient scheme is proposed which provides data integrity, identity anonymity, authentication, authorization, accountability (AAA) to the system model. We propose a system model having Ethereum based public blockchain distributed network in order to secure drone communication for the data collection and transmission. The proposed model provides secure communication between the drones and the users in a decentralized way. In this paper, blockchain technology is used for the storage of collected data from the drones and update the information into the distributed ledgers to reduce the burden of drones. It also provides integrity, authentication, and authorization to the collected data by the drones in the system model. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this paper is threefold. First, we select a forger node from the number of drones. Second, we create blocks and validate their processes. Third, we provide secure data dissemination by applying Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Afterward, we evaluate the security of the presented system model compared against the corresponding ones of some state-of-the-art in terms of communication time/cost. The results confirm that our system model is reliable and scalable for data dissemination in the IoD environment.

AB Graph edges, along with their labels, can represent information of fundamental importance, such as links between web pages, friendship between users, the rating given by users to other users or items, and much more. We introduce LEAP, a trainable, general framework for predicting the presence and properties of edges on the basis of the local structure, topology, and labels of the graph. The LEAP framework is based on the exploration and machine-learning aggregation of the paths connecting nodes in a graph. We provide several methods for performing the aggregation phase by training path aggregators, and we demonstrate the flexibility and generality of the framework by applying it to the prediction of links and user ratings in social networks.
   We validate the LEAP framework on two problems: link prediction, and user rating prediction. On eight large datasets, among which the arXiv collaboration network, the Yeast protein-protein interaction, and the US airlines routes network, we show that the link prediction performance of LEAP is at least as good as the current state of the art methods, such as SEAL and WLNM. Next, we consider the problem of predicting user ratings on other users: this problem is known as the edge-weight prediction problem in weighted signed networks (WSN). On Bitcoin networks, and Wikipedia RfA, we show that LEAP performs consistently better than the Fairness & Goodness based regression models, varying the amount of training edges between 10 to 90%. These examples demonstrate that LEAP, in spite of its generality, can match or best the performance of approaches that have been especially crafted to solve very specific edge prediction problems.

AB Blockchain-based audit trails provide a consensus-driven and tamper-proof trail of system events that are helpful in creating provenance in enterprise solutions. However, taking into account the transaction bulk generated by these applications and the throughput limitations of existing blockchains, a single ledger for record keeping can be inefficient and costly. To that end, we see an imperative need for a new blockchain design that is capable of addressing current challenges, without compromising security and provenance. Hence, we propose Block Trail, a scalable and efficient blockchain solution for auditing applications. BlockTrail fragments the legacy blockchain systems into layers of co-dependent hierarchies, thereby reducing the time and space complexity, and increasing the throughput. BlockTrail is prototyped on "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance" (PBFT) protocol with a custom-built blockchain. Experiments with BlockTrail show that compared to the conventional schemes, BlockTrail is more efficient, and has less storage footprint.

IoT enables devices with storage, computation and communication capabilities to connect to the Internet, thus providing various applications such as smart transportation, smart healthcare, smart industry, logistics and smart homes, to name a few. Since, IoT devices generates sensitive information, therefore, security is an important issue in IoT networks. Recently, Blockchain (BC) is proposed as a revolutionary technology which can be integrated within IoT to provide desired level of security and privacy. However, the integration of BC within IoT networks is extremely challenging. The major contribution of this study is three-fold. (1) Firstly, we proposed a tier-based architecture "Blockchain in Internet-of-ThingS (BITS)" which can support BC within IoT networks. (2) Secondly, we highlighted various applications of BC in IoT networks, and (3) Lastly, we provided various challenges and future research directions in the realization of BC in IoT networks.

AB The systematic integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) into the supply chain to increase operational efficiency and quality has also introduced new complexities to the threat landscape. The myriad of sensors could increase data collection capabilities for businesses to facilitate process automation aided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) but without adopting an appropriate Security-by-Design framework, threat detection and response are destined to fail. The emerging concept of Smart Workplace incorporates many CPS (e.g. Robots and Drones) to execute tasks alongside Employees both of which can be exploited as Insider Threats. We introduce and discuss forensic-readiness, liability attribution and the ability to track moving Smart SPS Objects to support modern Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) within a defence-in-depth strategy. We present a framework to facilitate the tracking of object behaviour within Smart Controlled Business Environments (SCBE) to support resilience by enabling proactive insider threat detection. Several components of the framework were piloted in a company to discuss a real-life case study and demonstrate anomaly detection and the emerging of behavioural patterns according to objects' movement with relation to their job role, workspace position and nearest entry or exit. The empirical data was collected from a Bluetooth-based Proximity Monitoring Solution. Furthermore, a key strength of the framework is a federated Blockchain (BC) model to achieve forensic-readiness by establishing a digital Chain-of-Custody (CoC) and a collaborative environment for CPS to qualify as Digital Witnesses (DW) to support post-incident investigations.

The proposed integrated smart parking system brings multiple parking service providers together under a unified platform aiming to provide one-stop parking information services to the commuters in a smart city. However, the adaptation of such a system is prone to tempering while a massive amount of data is shared among different parties which raise concerns related to trust and performance. To address this challenge, we propose a blockchain-based architecture specific to the integrated smart parking systems. Finally, we present a set of design principles which shows the applicability of our proposed blockchain-based integrated parking system.

AB With the surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin has emerged as one of the most promising means for remittance, payments, and trading. Supplemented by the convenience offered by the smartphones, an increasing number of users are adopting Bitcoin wallet apps for different purposes.
   In this paper, we focus on identifying user activities on smartphone-based Bitcoin wallet apps that are commonly used for sending, receiving, and trading Bitcoin. To accomplish our goal, we performed network traffic analysis using machine learning techniques. Since we focus on apps of the same type/functionality, it makes our classification problem even more difficult compared to classifying apps tailored for discrete purposes. Moreover, our goal is to identify user activities even in the presence of encryption. In our experiments, we considered the worldwide most downloaded Bitcoin wallet apps on both Google Play Store and Apple's App Store. For collecting network traffic traces, we used only physical hardware and omitted any emulator to build our experiment scenario as close to the real environment as possible. We process the traffic traces in several phases before extracting the features that are utilized to train our supervised learning algorithms. We deal with the classification problem in multiple stages in a hierarchical fashion. We ran a thorough set of experiments to assess the performance of our system and attained nearly 95% accuracy in user activity identification.

AB The banking system is of paramount importance for a market economy, because thanks to banks, the function of an intermediary is performed, and financial resources are distributed among the business entities. A key element of the banking system is its infrastructure. Banking is recognized as a commercial activity, that is, aimed at obtaining a certain profit, therefore the main, fundamental characteristic of its activity is the effective use of assets. Consequently, as long as there are banks and banking operations, there will always be topical tasks of braving the bank's infrastructure, and today digitalization.

AB There have been significant efforts in the UK to embrace health technology to improve provisions of care. Yet, healthcare offers unique challenges to innovation, particularly with regard to data siloing. Blockchain is a shared distributed ledger technology that decentralises information storage with the potential to improve health outcomes by concurrently optimising data sharing practices and data privacy. In this paper, we explore how blockchain technology may facilitate the handling of health data in the context of regulatory frameworks, patient rights, cybersecurity and provider-centric perspectives. This is essential if this developing technology is to be considered for implementation at scale.

AB The study of cryptocurrency as an economic tool has been the focus of attention of states and the international community over the past ten years. Many economists and government officials are very skeptical about the use of cryptocurrency by business entities. Using the anonymity of transactions carried out via the Internet the criminal world, on the contrary, conduct illegal transactions, for example, engage in money laundering, finance terrorism and extremism, promote the development of marketing channels for drugs and psychotropic substances.
   This kind of research is one of the first for the Republic of Kazakhstan. In this research, the authors tried to identify the potential opportunities and threats to the development of the cryptocurrency market in the context of combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Based on the analysis of international practices in the field of cryptocurrency market regulation, as well as the expert interviewing conducted by the authors, 2 main problems of cryptocurrency market development in Kazakhstan are identified. Firstly, the security problems of using cryptocurrency in the context of technical support, secondly, the lack of regulatory infrastructure for the development of the crypto currency market in the Republic of Kazakhstan.
   Finally, the authors come to the conclusion that the Republic of Kazakhstan is currently not ready to develop the cryptocurrency market, since there are a number of organizational and legal issues. Nevertheless, the authors are convinced that Kazakhstan should be part of the global crypto market and should be actively involved in the development, implementation and regulation of the cryptocurrency market

AB The healthcare industry is a complex system of interconnected entities. Each of these entities has disjoint information systems to manage patient data and records. The current IT solutions in healthcare systems have several challenges such as sharing and accessing medical records across several stakeholders while still maintaining security and privacy of these records. This global problem on how to create, maintain, and share sensitive medical records and clinical data among various stakeholders without sacrificing data privacy and integrity is still unresolved. In fact, existing healthcare records are decentralized, disjointed, non-uniform, and fragmented in nature. In this paper, we present a Blockchain-based framework, called DASS-CARE, that supports decentralized, accessible, scalable, and secure access to healthcare services including medical records. Such framework will greatly facilitate the process of real time access and updates without compromising security, integrity and confidentiality of patient data. Our objective is multifold. First, improve the quality of healthcare and lower the cost of delivery. Second, enhance medical records management including electronic health records unification. Finally, provide users with the ability to view their medical records regardless of their history, a task that is difficult to accomplish under the current fragmented systems.

AB In recent years, blockchain technology has affected to a large extent all aspects of life, however, until now paper-based elections have been practiced. It is time to upgrade the election scenario using modern technology such as blockchain and advanced cryptography methods. Actually, both of Estonia and New South Wales have been using i-voting systems, but after developing an example software of their systems for the purpose of analysis, it is discovered that it has weaknesses against many kinds of attacks, such as malwares, network attacks, and servers attacks. The fact that the blockchain technology has demonstrated infinite immutability and resistance against hacking, so it is possible to use it to secure election results from fraud by saving every single piece of data, record or transaction with unchangeable history. By abandoning the traditional database and compensating it with two blockchains instead of one ensures voter/vote privacy, as well as, safeguards the results from manipulation. Also, using blockchain's distributed network reduces the load on the network. Finally, solutions to problems of impersonation and vote selling are suggested. The technology behind the digital voting system design is explained in terms of the processes involved, such as ID creation, authentication, voting, and vote tallying.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is where almost anything can be controlled and managed remotely. Although the IoT evolution led to quality of life enhancement, many of its devices are insecure. The lack of robust key management systems, efficient identity authentication, low fault tolerance, and many other issues lead IoT devices into being easily targeted by attackers. The aim of this research is to enhance an authentication protocol that helps in the authentication process of IoT devices and CPANs (Personal Area Network Coordinators) in an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environment. To propose a solution for this issue, and to find out the optimal contribution, a comparison and analysis on the current IoT security solutions have been conducted. Based on the analysis, it is found that the superior solution was a Blockchain-based solution called BCTrust. In this paper, the aim is to improve the basis authentication protocol adopted by BCTrust. The protocol is to be improved mainly by two sides, firstly, eliminating the blacklisting mechanism that can be leveraged by attackers to negatively impact the network. Secondly, introducing a new way for generating the identifiers of the IIoT devices. This would enhance the security and efficiency of BCTrust, specifically in the generation of IIoT secret keys.

AB Integrating the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) into supply chain management enables flexible and efficient on-demand exchange of goods between merchants and suppliers. However, realizing a fair and transparent supply chain system remains a very challenging issue due to the lack of mutual trust among the suppliers and merchants. Furthermore, the current system often lacks the ability to transmit trade information to all participants in a timely manner, which is the most important element in supply chain management for the effective supply of goods between suppliers and the merchants. This paper presents a blockchain-based supply chain management system in the IIoT. The proposed system takes advantage of blockchain technology in terms of its transparency and tamper-proof nature to support fair goods exchange between merchants and suppliers. Additionally, the decentralization and pseudonymity property will play a significant role in preserving the privacy of participants in the blockchain. In particular, fairness in the IIoT is first defined. Then, a design for a smart contract for fair goods exchange is presented to prevent malicious behavior through imposing penalties. The proposed system was prototyped on Ethereum and experiments were conducted to demonstrate its feasibility.

AB Blockchain is the underlying technology of Bitcoin that allows a peer-to-peer distributed ledger with security and immutability. The core of a blockchain is the consensus mechanism that sets the rule for nodes in handling the shared data. Implementation of the consensus algorithm depends on the nature of targeted business environment. In this research, the performance of two consensus algorithms, Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Collatz Conjecture (PCC), are studied in the context of a private blockchain. A quantitative analysis on the execution time, deployment time, and latency time are done for 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 transactions and the results are presented. The results shows that PCC takes only (1/1000)th of the execution time that is required for PoW for these different sets of transactions. In addition, these timings are recorded for ten repeated executions for the same sets of transactions, and found that PCC has a nearly consistent execution time.

AB Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency built on the blockchain data structure, has generated significant academic and commercial interest. Contrary to prior expectations, recent research has shown that participants of the protocol (the so-called "miners") are not always incentivized to follow the protocol. We study the game induced by one such attack -the pool block withholding attack - in which mining pools (groups of miners) attack other mining pools. We focus on the case of two pools attacking each other, with potentially other mining power in the system.
   We show that this game always admits a pure Nash equilibrium, and its pure price of anarchy, which intuitively measures how much computational power can be wasted due to attacks in an equilibrium, is at most 3. We conjecture, and prove in special cases, that it is in fact at most 2. Our simulations provide compelling evidence for this conjecture, and show that players can quickly converge to the equilibrium by following best response strategies.

AB Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is getting popularity among low power computing devices as compared to high power and energy demanded proof-of work (PoW). Among the security issues of PoS, Long range attack is declared as one of the major issue by many researchers. Long range attack allows the minority stakeholders to become majority stakeholders over a long time span and then they can control the whole blockchain protocol to produce the valid alternative history. Checkpointing is referred as solution to mitigate the impact of the long range attack but still for the newly joined users as well as the users those will stay offline for long period of time, checkpointing mechanism needs to be re-evaluated. In this paper we studied the checkpointing mechanism and proposed a new strategy to implement the checkpointing inside the blockchain technology. The proposed strategy is designed specifically to mitigate the long range attack or stake bleeding attack.

AB This paper presents an investigation of the usability and security of the hardware wallet KeepKey 4.2.10. A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack was implemented to simulate potential attacks and evaluate its implications for the wallet's security. In the usability study, ten participants were observed as they used the wallet to complete various Bitcoin address comparison and confirmation tasks. Furthermore, the study examined users' sentiments towards the transaction process of the KeepKey wallet. The results illustrate that the majority of the participants could detect some but not all MITM attacks. Moreover, there were a considerable number of successful MITM attacks in the experiment. From a usability perspective, our findings show that the Keepkey system has some usability issues that should be tackled to enhance the usability and the security of the wallet.

AB While showing great promise, smart contracts are difficult to program correctly, as they need a deep understanding of cryptography and distributed algorithms, and offer limited functionality, as they have to be deterministic and cannot operate on secret data. In this paper we present Protean, a general-purpose decentralized computing platform that addresses these limitations by moving from a monolithic execution model, where all participating nodes store all the state and execute every computation, to a modular execution-model. Protean employs secure specialized modules, called functional units, for building decentralized applications that are currently insecure or impossible to implement with smart contracts. Each functional unit is a distributed system that provides a special-purpose functionality by exposing atomic transactions to the smart-contract developer. Combining these transactions into arbitrarily-defined workflows, developers can build a larger class of decentralized applications, such as provably-secure and fair lotteries or e-voting.

Bitcoin can be regarded as the first successful virtual currency, followed by many other implementations. Analogous to paper currencies, it is apparent that privacy and anonymity are two pivotal considerations that affect the adoption of virtual currencies by users. However, many studies have identified several problems associated with the privacy and anonymity of Bitcoin. Consequently, a large number of attempts have been made to address these issues, yet it has been proven that many such solutions do not provide an acceptable level of anonymity. This survey presents an account of the level of anonymity achieved through those and attempts to provide a comparative evaluation across different constructions.

AB The article substantiates that the developing process of moving real assets into the digital environment in order to carry out legally significant actions with them requires defining clear legal models of this process, and therefore the law, as an instrument of social regulation, undergoes qualitative changes under the influence of information and digitalization processes.
   The features of the interrelation and interdependency of law and the economy, characterized by the digitization of civil turnover are considered. The features of these interrelations, based on new technologies, using the existing toolset of civil law, are determined. A legal assessment of legislative innovations is given in connection with the adoption of the Federal Law "On Amendments to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation" (March 12, 2019), which legalized the concept of digital rights and individual transactions, conducted electronically in the information environment. In the context of existing points of view on the tokenization of objects of civil law and the digitalization of means and methods of conducting civil law transactions, the existing problems in legislation and legal practice on the regulation of digital rights are detected. Individual offers were made on the organizational and legal optimization of the processes occurring in this direction.

AB In this paper, we present Tendermint: a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) application-based blockchain. We show that Tendermint promotes another perception of blockchain programming. Unlike Ethereum which is a blockchain holding many applications, Tendermint proposes to have one application per blockchain. We discuss the idiosyncrasies of Tendermint and how it could, potentially, ease blockchain programming and improve performance. We finish by showing weaknesses of Tendermint, good practices to adopt to hinder security attacks when handling Tendermint nodes, and some potential adjustments in the IBC protocol - an interoperability protocol designed for Tendermint. Our goal is to introduce Tendermint by showing its main characteristics over traditional blockchain platforms such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

AB Two-factor authentication (2FA) is widely prevalent in banking, emails and virtual private networks (VPN) connections or in accessing any secure web service. In 2FA, to get authenticated the users are expected to provide additional secret information along with the password. Typically, this secret information (tokens) is generated by a centralized trusted third party upon receiving an authentication request from users. Thus, this additional layer of security comes at the cost of inherently trusting the third party for their services. The security of such authentication systems is always under the threat of the trusted party is being compromised. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to make server authentication even more secure by building 2FA over the blockchain platform which is distributed in nature. The proposed solution does not require any trusted third party between claimant (user) and the verifier (server) for the authentication purpose. To demonstrate the idea of using blockchain technology for 2FA, we have added an extra layer of security component to the OpenSSH server a widely used application for Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

AB Crowdsensed Data Trading (CDT) is a novel data trading paradigm, in which each data consumer can publicize its demand as some crowdsensing tasks, and some mobile users can compete for these tasks, collect the corresponding data, and sell the results to the consumers. Existing CDT systems either depend on a trusted data trading broker or cannot ensure sellers to report costs honestly. To address this problem, we propose a Reverse-Auction-and-blockchain-based crowdsensed Data Trading (RADT) system, mainly containing a smart contract, called RADToken. We adopt a greedy strategy to determine winners, and prove the truthfulness and individual rationality of the whole reverse auction process. Moreover, we exploit the smart contract with a series of devises to enforce mutually untrusted parties to participate in the data trading honestly. Additionally, we also deploy RADToken on an Ethereum test network to demonstrate its significant performances. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CDT work that exploits both auction and blockchain to ensure the truthfulness of the whole data trading process.

TI Self-Organizing in Blockchain Infrastructures: Generativity Through
   Shifting Objectives and Forking
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Given the ubiquity of digital technologies, and increased use of autonomous algorithms, it is likely that many of today's social and organizational processes will one day include autonomous elements. The Bitcoin blockchain is likely the first case of an increasingly generative and autonomous way of organizing, and the specific properties of blockchain infrastructures-distribution of control, openness to manipulation, and generativity of the underlying source code-make it an ideal case to study patterns of self-organizing. This paper investigates the phenomenon of self-organizing through a study of forking in the Bitcoin blockchain infrastructure between 2010 and 2016. It adds to the emerging body of research on digital infrastructures, and particularly blockchain infrastructures, by conceptualizing forking as a pattern of self-organizing in blockchain infrastructures that specifically involves the underlying infrastructure, the scale of code changes, individual objectives, and collective adoption, whether specific or general. Thus, this paper demonstrates how forking in blockchain infrastructures mediates between divergent organizing objectives and existing capabilities, on the one hand, and generates self-organizing on the other hand. In this paper, we further contextualize our findings in extant work on digital infrastructures, offer a guide for designers of blockchain infrastructures, and propose the concept of "generative mirroring" as a pattern through which blockchain infrastructures and organizing adaptively coevolve.

AB Blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and several others execute complex transactions in blocks through user defined scripts known as smart contracts. Normally, a block of the chain consists of multiple transactions of smart contracts which are added by a miner. To append a correct block into the blockchain, miners execute these transactions of smart contracts sequentially. Later the validators serially re-execute the smart contract transactions of the block. If the validators agree with the final state of the block as recorded by the miner, then the block is said to be validated. It is then added to the blockchain using a consensus protocol. In Ethereum and other blockchains that support cryptocurrencies, a miner gets an incentive every time such a valid block successfully added to the blockchain.
   In most of the current day blockchain the miners and validators execute the smart contract transactions serially. In the current era of multi-core processors, by employing the serial execution of the transactions, the miners and validators fail to utilize the cores properly and as a result, have poor throughput. By adding concurrency to smart contracts execution, we can achieve better efficiency and higher throughput. In this paper, we develop an efficient framework to execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using optimistic Software Transactional Memory systems (STMs).
   Miners execute smart contract trans lions concurrently using multi-threading to generate the final state of blockchain. STM is used to take care of synchronizationissues among the transactions and ensure atomicity. Now when the validators also execute the transactions (as a part of validation) concurrently using multi-threading, then the validators may get a different final state depending on the order of execution of conflicting transactions. To avoid this, the miners also generate a block graph of the transactions during the concurrent execution and store it ill the block. This graph captures the conflict relations among the transactions and is generated concurrently as the transactions are executed by different threads. The miner proposes a block which consists of set of transactions, block graph, hash of the previous block, and final state of each shared data-objects. Later, the validators re-execute the same smart contract transactions concurrently and deterministically with the help of block graph given by the miner to verify the final state. If the validation is successful then proposed block appended into the blockchain and miner gets incentive otherwise discard the proposed block.
   We execute the smart contract transactions concurrently using Basic Time stamp Ordering (BTO) and Multi-Version Time stamp Ordering (MVTO) protocols as optimistic STMs. BTO and MVTO miner achieves 3.6x and 3.7x average speedups over serial miner respectively. Along with, BTO and MVTO validator outperform average 40.8x and 47.1x than serial validator respectively.

TI Chains, Coins and Contract Law: The Validity and Enforceability of Smart
   Contracts
SO AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS LAW REVIEW
AB This article considers the validity and enforceability of smart contracts under Australian contract law. Smart contracts are agreements, expressed at least partially in computer code, that utilise distributed ledger technologies such as blockchain to interpret, perform and enforce their terms without human intervention. Smart contracts have already been used in the structure of conditional payments, financial derivatives and investment mechanisms, with scope for much broader application in the near-term. The recent emergence of smart contracts and absence of legislative or judicial intervention has left uncertainty as to their legal validity and position relative to conventional contracts. After outlining the technology's characterisation and operation, this article turns to the question of whether smart contracts are capable of meeting the doctrinal requirements for an enforceable contract in Australian law. In finding that they are, it supports their continued usage and adoption.

AB With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), scalability becomes a significant concern due to the huge amounts of data generated in IoT systems. A centralized data exchange is not desirable as it leads to a single performance bottleneck. Although a distributed data exchange removes the central bottleneck, it has network performance issues as data passes among multiple coordinators. A decentralized approach is the only solution that fully enables the realization of efficient IoT systems, since there is no single performance bottleneck and network overhead is minimized. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages the semantics of DX-MAN for realizing decentralized data flows in IoT systems. The algebraic semantics of such a model allows a well-defined structure of data flows which is easily analyzed by an algorithm that forms a direct relationship between data consumers and data producers. For the analysis, the algorithm takes advantage of the fact that DX-MAN separates control flow and data flow. Thus, our approach prevents passing data alongside control among multiple coordinators, so data is only read and written on a decentralized data space. We validate our approach using smart contracts on the Blockchain, and conducted experiments to quantitatively evaluate scalability. The results show that our approach scales well with the size of IoT systems.

AB A blockchain is a tamper-proof distributed transaction registry; first popularized by Bitcoin [1], it has now been extended to support storage of arbitrary state and computations in-ledger. Ethereum [2] and its smart contract model have proven to be a very popular choice for this task, routinely managing assets valued in the billions. However, development of such contracts has been anything but easy. While formally specified, the Ethereum execution platform is based on a low-level machine, quite similar to assembly; semantics for contract operations such as call are quite complex, and the need for resource management creates unanticipated modes of failure. The dominant day-to-day programming platform for Ethereum is Solidity [3], an Object-Oriented language that identifies contracts with objects. While reasoning about Solidity programs is much easier than for their bytecode counterparts, it is not extent of challenges either, and moreover, Solidity lacks a source-level semantics, which forces developers to reason over output bytecode again. In this short paper we explore the main barriers to lift in order to achieve a principled compilation strategy for Solidity. We will review the standard concepts on verified and secure compilation, and frame them in the context of the Ethereum platform.

AB The main attraction of cryptocurrency is the decentralized, append-only public ledger blockchain that records the transactions. The current challenge of bitcoin blockchain is to increase the throughput. Two-party or multi-party payment channel using multi-signature address formed a connected payment network to solve the issue of scaling that fascinated bitcoin community. The micropayment channel solution implicitly assumes that parties will continue to interact for long intervals. This assumes a long-lived relation between buyer and seller. Another major disadvantage of forcing participants to lock funds for long intervals. The micropayment channel must know about the parties beforehand.
   We address this issue and present a protocol that offers freedom to do micropayment transaction with anyone as per the need without any prior knowledge about the parties. The protocol gives an alternate secured path for zero-confirmation transactions. From the test cases, we have shown that buyer will get quick services from sellers and honest sellers will not lose their funds share.

AB The primary aim of food traceability is to increase food safety but traceability systems can also bring other benefits to production systems and supply chains. Technology has helped supply chain distribution to be successful and more competitive in the global market by improving their customers satisfaction level and providing more reasonable prices compared to their competitors. However, nowadays supply chains are long and complex and include many different actors, beginning with the farmers, followed by collectors, traders, manufacturers. At the end, the processed products are difficult to trace back to their origins in a trusted way. Best way so far is the continuous medial or legal documentation of the chain of transactions, available only to a limited circle of persons. The recent efforts toward blockchain-based trust management open a new perspective here. Here, we propose a solution to link legal documentation and blockchain technology within a traceability system, with the specific application case of cacao and chocolate production in mind. For improved data security, the common blockchain concept is extended to a two-factor blockchain, where both blockchains are connected via digital watermarking of the documentation media, one blockchain traces the documentation steps, the other the watermarking embedding. By a unique reading-verification approach, the integrity of their relatedness can be proven, thus improving also reliability of the whole product tracing.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating almost all sectors of the global economy, addressing a wide range of opportunities by applying different Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to IoT data. Due to the diversity in challenges and applications, IoT solutions are often bespoke and highly domain specific. With the surge of IoT applications, this approach to solutions becomes very costly and time consuming if there is a lack of reusability and replicability across different IoT sectors. This work presents a step towards reusability of IoT solution components applied to Industrial IoT (IIoT). We start from the challenging position of two unique AI-driven applications stemming from two separate IIoT verticals - applications which may be realized using the same components. We identify a set of application independent reusable AI-centric components and show how they can be orchestrated into the unique IoT applications. Our approach shortens the time to market and reduces costs for developing IIoT solutions, and opens a path towards reusability and replicability of IIoT components, thus accelerating the IoT market uptake.

AB Pervasive systems over the years continuous to grow exponentially. Engagement of IoT in fields such as Agriculture, Home automation, industrial applications etc is on the rise. Self organizing networks within the IoT field give rise to engagement of various nodes for data communication. The rise in Cyber-attacks within IoT pose a lot of threat to these connected nodes and hence there is a need for data passing through nodes to be verified during communication. In this paper we proposed a nodal authentication approach in IoT using blockchain in securing the integrity of data passing through the nodes in IoT. In our work, we engaged the GOST algorithm in our approach. At the end, we achieved a nodal authentication and verification of the transmitted data. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to fake a node in the communication chain of the connected nodes. Data integrity was achieved in the nodes during the communication.

AB Research related to electric vehicles (EV) is mainly focused on the hardware such as battery charging method, and still there is a lack of software research such as billing system that needs to be developed realistically. The result of charge measured in the charging EV can be different from the charged amount claimed to be charged in the charging system (CS). However, due to the potential security and privacy issues caused by untrusted and opaque energy markets, it becomes a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging behaviors of EVs with distinct energy delivery preferences of the CSs. In this paper, a novel EV participation charging scheme is proposed for a decentralized blockchain using smart contracts. Firstly, a permissioned blockchain system is introduced to implement secure charging services for EVs with the execution of smart contracts. Furthermore, based on the smart contract designed each EVs individual needs from CS is satisfied while maximizing its utility.

TI Visual Surveillance Within the EU General Data Protection Regulation A
   Technology Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB From an individual's perspective, technological advancement has merits and demerits. Video captured by surveillance cameras while a person goes about their daily life may improve their personal safety but the images collected may also represent an invasion of their privacy. Because of the ease of digital information sharing, there exists a need to protect that visual information from illegal utilization by untrusted parties. The European parliament has ratified the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which has been effective since May 2018 with a view to ensuring the privacy of European Union (EU) citizens' and visitors' personal data. The regulation has introduced data safeguards through Pseudonymisation, Encryption, and Data protection-by-design. However, the regulation does not assist with technical and implementation procedures, such as video redaction, to establish those safeguards. This paper refers to the GDPR term "personal data" as "visual personal data" and aims to discuss regulatory safeguards of visual privacy, such as reversible protection, from the technological point-of-view. In the context of GDPR, the roles of machine learning (i.e. within computer vision), image processing, cryptography, and blockchain are explored as a way of deploying Data Protection-by-Design solutions for visual surveillance data. The paper surveys the existing market-based data protection solutions and provides suggestions for the development of GDPR-compliant Data Protection-by-Design video surveillance systems. The paper is also relevant for those entities interacting with EU citizens from outside the EU and for those regions not currently covered by such regulation that may soon implement similar provisions.

AB Immutability is a core principle of blockchain platforms that help all participants to have an exact global log of transactions. Immutability is easier to achieve in permissioned blockchain platforms where a trusted group are the validators. In public platforms, this vital property of blockchain can be achieved only through decentralized economic mechanisms like Proof-of-Work(PoW). Blockchain along with the concept of asset tokenization provides liquidity to markets like stock trading and exchange other intangible objects. With changes in regulatory policies and/or government laws, there could be a requisite to alter the contents in such markets. We propose an idea of using Chameleon hash functions that will enable modification of a block without changing other block contents. In our proposal, the trapdoor key used to redact a block is split among major validators and is reconstructed using Multi-Party Computation(MPC). Redaction happens when the major validators agree the suggested changes by digitally signing the proposal. This eliminates the need to rely on a trusted party. We also propose an idea of using second trapdoor key that will be with the creator of the block. This can be used in scenarios where the block redaction should not happen without the consent of the creator.

In recent years very rapid growth and deep concern is perceived in advancing the smart systems for industrial,agricultural and domestic use to enable the identification of unprecedented solutions. Heterogeneous bids are raised and installed in this placewhich grasped the strengthen presence of wireless, radio-frequency identification (RFID), mobile, and exact radar appliances. Nevertheless, for the future, the modern internet appliancesmodel along with old cloud-based architecture remained not designed. It becomes difficult for the future needs to bond the billions of systems by the central processing model. connectivity cost, sensor data of meaningful value creation, traceability, setting-up digital confidence, reliability, intercepting focus of power, recalcitrant intricacy, security, latency, and privacy are heterogeneous dimensions that linked with the paramount bottleneck. To make the distributed IoT work the conception of decentralization in IoT space was the only solution to overcome the above stated hurdles. The present paper brings into view the existing place of research on IoT and its needful prospective professionalthrough the thematic analysis of distributed IoT. This paper also illustrates the prospects in decentralization ecosystem, variegated tasks and latitudes, which provide the pathways for the future researches.

AB Emergency service call for public service providers has become an important role for smart home applications in order to support safety and security in the household building. Blockchain has been a promising solution with cryptography and incentive distributed mechanisms to support the verification, execution and recording of transactions between untrusted parties. In this paper, we present a Smart Home System (SHS) based on Ethereum with smart contract infrastructure for handling an emergency service sending from SHS to Home Service Providers (HSP) when there are unusual environmental conditions. Our SHS testbed consists of three domains: (1) Smart Home Sensor Manager (SM) or IoT devices to gather environmental sensor data and send an emergency call to HSP, (2) Home Service Provider (HSP) system deployed with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and smart contract, and (3) decentralize Meteor framework to interface between Ethereum and web based applications for homeowners (HO) and HSP staffs. To achieve homeowner privacy and security, we enable digital signature coupling with InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for handling the emergency call from SM to HSP and One Time Passcode (OTP) produced by HSP for HSP staffs to verify themselves for further access control when they go to service homeowner's house. Each smart contract transaction in solidity is described. Finally, security and privacy issues for our proposed work are discussed.

AB The main goal of the research is to assess the potential of using an innovative blockchain technology in the oil and gas industry in Russia, to increase the competitiveness of Russian companies in the international arena, and to contribute to development of a successful partnership between the state and business. In the age of research and development, technologies evolve to such an extent that new ideas, as soon as they emerge, instantly become obsolete and evaporate in a flash. What are the most advanced of the latest technologies, which the whole world is watching for today. The application of innovative technologies is the main benefit of any industry that is open for their use. Industrial complexes in the field of oil and gas extraction monitor closely the situation of developing new technologies. However, the fact that the oil and gas industries are of global importance, these industries are old-fashioned activities that do not hurry to apply new technologies. Considering the number of daily processes occurring in the natural resources sector, we need to move beyond the usual manner of doing business. Oil and gas companies should introduce a simplified form of document management by using safe technologies. Millions of new technologies can positively or negatively influence the development of the fuel and energy complex. Therefore, the most important thing is to evaluate technologies, analyze their suitability for the industry and determine priorities for further opportunities. (C) 2019 Published by Future Academy

AB The role of record keeping and information sharing in the health sector cannot be overemphasized. More recently, there has been renewed interest in finding a solution to the issues pertaining to privacy of health records and how these records can be easily accessed by different healthcare providers in healthcare-service delivery. Thus, such records comprise an individual's health history and other information that facilitates healthcare decisions. Furthermore, easy access to a patient's health information is an important aspect of health-service delivery that must be regulated and monitored because of the sensitivity of the information. Current approaches adopted in many hospitals face challenges of missing files, or records, lack of information sharing between healthcare providers, insecure records and also inaccessibility of patients' health information for healthcare providers that are needed to make informed health decisions. Building from a case study grounded in interviews and document review, we propose a scalable framework that supports the adoption of blockchain technology in addressing the issues of privacy, information sharing, and record keeping in the health sector.

AB While academic institutions maintain records such as transcripts and certificates, they are often requested to share these records with other institutions at the request of students for credit transfer, or prerequisites for acceptance into new academic programs. While the transfer of academic records is a regular daily activity for the institutions, there is often significant overhead involved as the process of transfer and verification is extremely manual. The need for an automated end-to-end solution for the transfer and verification of academic records between institutions is on the edge to reduce wait times for students to transfer their records, as well as to provide a reliable verification method to avoid academic fraud. This paper presents a permissioned blockchain-based system to allow institutions to securely and dependably transfer and verify academic records at the student request. Permissioned blockchains, such as Hyperledger, provide a more scalable and cost-effective and private solution for enterprise applications. Our solution is comprised of a web interface for enrolling and requesting the transfer, with a backend using Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer to retain the hash of the records on the blockchain for verification.

AB Blockchain is experiencing rapid development and has the full potential of revolutionizing the IoT platform in the industrial field. In this paper, a light-weighted Blockchain-based platform for IIoT is presented to address security, trust, and island connection problem in the process of IIoT ecosystem construction. BPIIoT is comprised of the on-chain network and the off-chain network. All transactions are processed in the on-chain network such as including digital signature based on access control and programmable permission. The off-chain network deals with the storage, complex data processing, and other problems that blockchain cannot solve. The smart contract is utilized as the service contract of consumers and manufacture resources, providing on-demand manufacturing service. Two smart application cases, manufacturing equipment data sharing and maintenance service sharing from smart manufacturing, are implemented to explain the smart contract for equipment maintenance service and status data sharing service throughout maintenance, repair, and operation service network by the BPIIoT.

AB This paper studies a fundamental problem regarding the security of blockchain on how the existence of multiple misbehaving pools influences the profitability of selfish mining. Each selfish miner maintains a private chain and makes it public opportunistically for the purpose of acquiring more rewards incommensurate to his Hashrate. We establish a novel Markov chain model to characterize all the state transitions of public and private chains. The minimum requirement of Hashrate together with the minimum delay of being profitable is derived in close-form. The former reduces to 21.48% with the symmetric selfish miners, while their competition with asymmetric Hashrate puts forward a higher requirement of the profitable threshold. The profitable delay increases with the decrease of the Hashrate of selfish miners, making the mining pools more cautious on performing selfish mining.

AB Blockchains (BCs) received significant attentions from FinTeh in recent years. Many proof-of-concepts (POCs) projects and experiments have been carried out to explore the strengths and weaknesses of constructing financial market infrastructures upon BCs. The experiments showed that considerable improvements are still necessary to meet financial requirements such as safety, efficiency, reliability, scalability, security and transparency. The Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure (PFMI), issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement System (CPSS) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), is a key standard for designing Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) so that global financial markets could be more robust and stable, especially, could withstand financial shocks. It is thus necessary to design BC-based FMIs according to PFMI. This position paper analyzes financial system requirements and the challenges, and discusses the design issues of BCs in meeting PFMI.

However, previous researches only focus on the analysis of attack pattern ratherthan fixing the vulnerability. In order to complement the vulnerability, we propose a blockchain platform in which try to identify the modulated data when server is attacked. Also, we find out potential risks in EEG data with non-blockchain environments after attack in our study. As a result, the proposed system can guarantee the integrity of EEG data by knowing the change of hash, and can prevent attacks such as hijacking, sniffing, and eavesdropping.

AB The future deployment of vehicular networks for road transportation (the so called Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) in Europe or Connected Vehicles program in USA) should be based on the secure exchange of messages among the vehicles and the infrastructure communication nodes. Deployment projects in various parts of the world are setting up Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) to support the security and privacy aspects on vehicular communications. While the use of PKI is a known technology to build a security framework for C-ITS and Connected Vehicles deployments and it will provide the basic needed services for integrity and authentication, research communities around the world are exploring extensions of these frameworks to implement specific functions like misbehavior detection and revocation. In addition, new techniques to mitigate privacy risks in vehicular networks are explored. In this paper, we address these aspects by proposing the use of blockchain in combination with a zone keys concept where the authorization certificates produced by the PKI are provided to the vehicles only if specific conditions stored in the blockchain are valid. We show how the concepts described in this paper can enhance the PKI-based frameworks through an efficient revocation mechanism, and mitigating privacy risks as well.

TI Connecting Bitcoin Blockchain with Digital Learning Chain Structure in
   Education
SO ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA
AB In the present paper, an extension of the Bitcoin (BTC) structure is introduced, with a proprietary and unique DLCC (Digital Learning Chain Structure) blockchain, through which an automated bursary payment system could be constituted, which has, until this day, never been implemented at universities. Thus, an alternative is offered to achieve a bursary payment system, operating in a fully automatic, periodically repeating manner, never requiring supervision. In the DLCC blockchain, specifically, in the Smart Contract, the terms of contract are kept, concerning the bursaries, terms agreed by both parties (students and universities alike). A great advantage of the DLCC system is that it is able to extract the required grades from the electronic grade book, thus supervising the students' progress throughout the semesters. Upon reaching the end of each semester, if the student qualifies, meeting the requirements, the system will transfer the required quantity of cryptocurrency from the university's account automatically to the student's account.

AB Blockchain architectures and applications emerged from the Bitcoin model, and are still most commonly associated with currency applications, and with financial speculation. This perception has driven the reward mechanisms for the various kinds of coin mining fueled consensus techniques seen in the vast majority of blockchain applications.
   As an alternative to reward mechanisms via coin payment, we propose denial of service to the application in question and/or revocation of participant confidentiality as punishment mechanisms for enterprise mission critical blockchain applications, to be used as part of the incentive mix sustaining the application. This obviates or diminishes the need for reward via cryptocurrencies, along with all their attendant volatility, insecure ecosystem and market manipulation demerits.
   We emphatically stress the importance of correctly balancing diverse application specific interests in the engineering of blockchain applications.

AB Smart grid (SG) provides a peer-to-peer energy trading mechanism wherein the electric vehicles (EVs) can trade for energy with their peers using the information and communication technologies. However, the dependence on third party for coordinating the energy trading decisions leads to a bottleneck for any distributed environment. Therefore, blockchain technology can provide a privacy-preserving and effective consensus mechanism without the control of trusted third party. Although blockchain provides inherent secure framework for transactional process, but the this security is because of computational complexity enforced. In SG environment, the conventional blockchain process could not be employed due to limited computational resources with EVs, which makes it difficult to solve the tough computational puzzles to validate the transactions. On the other hand, any compromise on the computation difficulty makes it more vulnerable to various types of attacks. Therefore, in this paper, SmartChain: a blockchain inspired smart and scalable ledger framework which does not require much computational complexity is designed for secure peer-to-peer energy trading in SG ecosystem. The proposed framework is evaluated using the parameters such as execution and validation time. The results obtained depict the superiority of SmartChain in contrast to the conventional blockchain process.

TI Pseudonym Management Through Blockchain: Cost-Efficient Privacy
   Preservation on Intelligent Transportation Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Research into the established area of the intelligent transportation system is evolving into the Internet of Vehicles, a fast-moving research area, fuelled in part by rapid changes based on cyber-physical systems. It needs to be recognized that existing vehicular communication systems are susceptible to privacy vulnerabilities which require addressing. Apractical challenge is that many vehicular communication applications and services make use of basic safety messages that contain the identity of the vehicle, location, and other personal data. A popular way of dealing with this privacy issue is to utilize a pseudonym change scheme to protect the vehicle's identity and location. However, many such schemes suffer that the cost grows and the certificate management difficulty raises with the number of pseudonyms generated and stored, casting doubt of the economic feasibility of that approach. We propose a decentralized blockchain-based solution for pseudonym management that overcomes these limitations. This scheme consists of pseudonym distribution and a shuffle operation, allowing the reuse of existing pseudonyms to different vehicles. The results reported here, including those from our simulations, demonstrate that the proposed scheme can reuse existing pseudonyms and achieve a better degree of anonymity at a lower cost than existing schemes.

AB This article suggests that, while the state of the art in the Civil Law tradition is incapable of producing a coherent and transversal answer to address the regulation of cryptocurrencies, and in general, virtual goods, drafters and lawmakers should aim to produce the rules necessary to achieve narrowly defined and explicit policy goals. In the article I show the shortcomings of using the existing legal concepts to regulate cryptocurrencies, and additionally show that in practice and financially, they have not yet achieved the necessary importance to force traditional concepts used to regulate currency upon them. The argument goes in line with previous literature that claims that current suggestions to regulate cryptocurrencies do not risk inhibiting their development, but risk shallow and ineffective regulation that might damage particular actors like early-adopters or those willing to experiment with newer technologies.

AB Cyber-physical housing technology is going through a revolution, started the early 2000s and expected to continue in the years to come. In fact, according to market research reports, connected devices for smart homes will soon have the largest market share of all IoT devices. In contrast with siloed devices and applications, which until recently prevailed even in the most sophisticated dwellings, nowadays it is already possible to glimpse a complex blend of technologies seamlessly integrated to promote the residents' comfort. However, several challenges lie ahead before the technology can fully support such a visionary scenario. One of them is security, especially in scenarios encompassing low-end embedded devices. This paper describes a mechanism allowing limited resource embedded appliances to participate in a network of IoT devices secured by a distributed ledger technology named IOTA. The paper describes the devised proof-of-concept implementation and provides insight on preliminary performance results showing its feasibility.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is making significant advances, especially in smart environments, but it still suffers from security issues and vulnerabilities. Hence, the security approach seems to be inappropriate for IoT-based workspaces due to the centralised architecture used by most connected objects. However, BlockChain (BC) is a technology that has been recently used to enhance security in mainly peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. The main research goal of this study is to determine whether BC, IoT, and decentralised models can be used to secure Smart Learning Environments (SLEs). In this paper, we propose a new secure and reliable architecture for connected workspaces that eliminates the central intermediary, while preserving most of the security benefits. The system is investigated on an environment containing several connected sensors and uses the BC application, offering a hierarchical network that manages transactions and profits from the distributed trust method to enable a decentralised communication model. Finally, an evaluation is conducted to highlight the effectiveness in providing security for the novel system.

AB Global agricultural trade flows demonstrated a three-fold growth during the past decade particularly in emerging economies. At the same time, global food scandals in conjunction with the spillover effects in economy and society highlight the unreliability of existing food tracking systems and the inefficiency in monitoring food quality and fraud incidents across global food supply chains (SCs). Blockchain technology (BCT), which has already been successfully applied on the financial industry to validate critical transactions, seems to be a promising option. This research investigates a two-stage containerized food SC by implementing a demonstrator application at the Hyperledger Fabric framework. The study findings indicates that on one hand BCT has entered its maturity phase while on the other hand its adoption in food SC operations could add significant value by authenticating critical parameters and providing enhanced traceability. At the same time, BCT enabled by other digital technologies could allow for the optimization of global food SCs. Thus, BCT constitutes a promising digital technology that provides the capability to food SC stakeholders to securely share information, enhance process control and traceability and prevent potential risks.

AB In the last decade, we have witnessed the emergence of a new socioeconomic paradigm related to Internet-based virtual communities that promote practices of sharing the use or consumption of products and services: the collaborative economy. Despite growing research on the most diverse areas of the collaborative economy, research on the integration of blockchain systems into collaborative economy organizations is still rather limited. By the present investigation, purely explanatory and based on a comparative and interpretive case study, we intend to verify the susceptibility of the blockchain systems to foster the emergence of new business models. Due to the small number of organizations in the collaborative economy currently operating with blockchain-based business models, it will be important in future investigations to identify and study the influence of these systems on the business models of other organizations, in particular whether their adoption represents a source of competitive advantage.

AB Traditional payment systems have standards designed to keep transaction data secure, but blockchain systems are not in scope for such security standards. We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard's (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard's applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms' industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM's and Ethereum's capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard's results. Finally, we discuss open research issues.

TI DL-Tags: DLT and Smart Tags for Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving, and
   Verifiable Supply Chain Management
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Supply chain management enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions integrate special tags (e.g., RFID, NFC, and QR-codes) with products to create Smart Tags, in addition to storing supplemental information about a product, which is also used to track products during their lifecycle. However, a product consumer has to implicitly trust the Smart Tag creator and other stakeholders within the supply chain that they are providing authentic data within a product's tag. The DL-Tags solution steps into this environment to offer a decentralized, privacy-preserving, and verifiable management of Smart Tags during a product's lifecycle. The solution is based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and uses the Ethereum blockchain to mediate interactions between the stakeholders during a product's exchange process. By reaching a consensus on the product's description and state logged on the blockchain, all involved stakeholders and product consumers can verify the product's authenticity without revealing their identity. The paper describes the DL-Tags solution and includes a cost analysis of all implemented transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The proposed solution provides evidence of the product's origin and its journey across the supply chain while preventing tag duplication and manipulation. It is among the first documented practical solutions using DLT and IoT for supply chain management, which is designed to be distributed ledger agnostic.

We deliver an energy-efficient interactive mining protocol enacted between clients and servers which uses quantum information encoded in light and removes the need for trust in network infrastructure. Instead, clients on the network need only trust the transparent network code, and that their devices adhere to the rules of quantum physics. To demonstrate the energy efficiency of the mining protocol, we elaborate upon the results of two previous experiments (one performed over 1km of optical fibre) as applied to this work. Finally, we address some key vulnerabilities, explore open questions, and observe forward-compatibility with the quantum internet and quantum computing technologies.

This article identifies the detailed nature of technological changes in electronics and systems; big data, automation and artificial intelligence; and security, including blockchain; as those changes affect tax administration. It highlights the critical taxpayer rights issues and applies accepted taxpayer rights frameworks. The article concludes that taxpayer rights principles are both highly adaptable to a digital world, and provide useful guidance to where urgent action and further research are required.

AB Current solutions for designing and building decentralized blockchain applications lack interoperability. Consequently, blockchains and existing technologies do not integrate well in a unified framework. This integration is necessary to work around some of the blockchains constraints, such as scalability of transactions and ergonomics. Indeed, blockchains are not suitable for huge data storage, but there are distributed data storage solutions that can be used in a decentralized blockchain application. Regarding ergonomics, the use of blockchain technology should be in the background and transparent for users that may not know how to set up and secure a blockchain-based application.
   We propose an architecture aiming to easily link existing decentralized technologies and blockchains. We then discuss the impact of this architecture for the video game industry. As a result, we propose an original data representation of blockchain gaming assets in order to improve data exchanges in this industry.

AB Bitcoin is a virtual currency that is now known as a decentralized payment system that can transfer money through the computer without having to go to a bank or institution. Bitcoin now becomes a popular method of payment in exchange for goods and services. This has been and continues to be used by some people for illegal activities and to promote crimes. Being decentralized means that it is issued without a central administration authority. To achieve a precise business with Bitcoin, it is necessary to eliminate current barriers and prepare for the acceptance of new technologies in digital currency. This document discusses the challenges of Bitcoin as a virtual currency and we do not intend to cover all aspects of Bitcoin.

AB The concerns held on the scalability of permissionless Blockchain platforms are a significant hindrance to their wider adoption. To address this issue rigorously, we consider it opportune to assess the current implementation and the associated improvement proposals, within a single coherent evaluation framework. This work addresses this specific question in the particular context of Ethereum, a prominent implementation of Blockchain, using a threefold approach. First, it maps the internal constituents of Ethereum onto a layered architecture inspired in the ISO/OSI model, so that its provisioning organization can be better understood. Second, it employs the AKF Scale Cube to analyze the pros and cons of the present specification of Ethereum, as well as of the current improvement proposals, so that the scalability challenges can be reasoned about in an orderly fashion. Finally, it uses an extensible test environment with synthetic benchmarks so that the transaction throughput of the current implementation of Ethereum can be evaluated in a private scenario, when no smart contract is to run. Our conclusions suggest that Ethereum respects the scalability trilemma being versed on security and decentralization renouncing scalability. These limits can be mitigated by adopting novel solutions such as Plasma and Sharding which enable a significant increment of performance by partitioning the data, and, ultimately, unlocking parallel execution of the transactions.

TI A Lightweight and Efficient Secure Hybrid RSA (SHRSA) Messaging Scheme
   With Four-Layered Authentication Stack
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB For virtual private network and LAN-to-LAN tunnel sessions, End-to-End security is the main constraint in private messaging scenarios. Internet Protocol Security can negotiate new keys for every communication, but when the key is compromised, it is a problem. Perfect Forward Secrecy is the resolution. In addition, the messaging scheme should be efficient and lightweight for keeping parity with daily needs. The popular Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cipher is omnipresent in secure communications but has many scientific problems. So here, in this paper, a lightweight and efficient Secure Hybrid RSA (SHRSA) messaging scheme with four-layered authentication stack is implemented and analyzed. The scheme is resolving the problem of asymptotic very low speed of decryption of RSA, the computational modular exponentiation complexity and partial key exposure vulnerability issues of RSA, and many more. The four-layered authentication stack have eliminated the need of the use of any password, external digital certificates, and a third party for authentication with its own four techniques in a staked way. We have found that in evolutions and analysis of the scheme, it is not only resolving various scientific problems of RSA but also occupying 2%-4% less CPU than main RSA and occupying 1%-3% less memory than main RSA. Its decryption average time has gained 8.858 times compared to the main RSA and gained 2.248 times compared to CRT RSA. We have found that the RSA, CRT-RSA, and SHRSA's encryption throughput are alike-all are around 6 KB/Sec but decryption throughput of SHRSA has gained 8.5345 times than main RSA and gained 2.1174 times than CRT-RSA. The results obtained have shown us the relevancies of the SHRSA messaging scheme to be integratable as a cipher in Blockchain architectures, cyber-physical systems, and the Internet of Everything.

TI Explicating the future of work: perspectives from India
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT
AB Purpose The world is witnessing the advent of a wide range of technologies like machine learning, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, robotics, additive manufacturing, augmented and virtual reality, cloud computing, Internet of Things and such others. Amidst this concoction of diverse technologies, the future of work is getting redefined. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to understand the future of work in the context of an emerging economy like India.
   Design/methodology/approach The authors undertook a qualitative research with a positivist approach. The authors undertook expert interviews with 26 respondents. The respondents were interviewed with a semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. The responses were content analyzed for themes. System dynamics was applied to explicate the phenomenon studied.
   Findings The authors found that the future of work has multiple facets. The authors found that in future, organizations would not only use automation for lower end routine manual jobs, but also for moderate knowledge-centric tasks. Future jobs would have significant data dependency, and employees would be expected to analyze and synthesize data for sense making. Another finding pointed out that in future, individuals would be constantly required for skills upgradation and thus learning would become a continuous lifelong process. In future, individuals would get short-term tasks rather than long-term secured jobs. Thus, job flexibility would be high as freelancing would be a dominant way of work. Organizations would reduce dedicated workspaces and would use co-working spaces to reduce office space investments. In future, jobs that are impregnated with novelty and creativity would remain. A finding of concern was that with the advent of automated technologies a larger portion of workforce would lose jobs and there could be widespread unemployment that might lead to social unrest. The provision of universal basic income has been advocated by some experts to handle social crisis.
   Research limitations/implications This research is based on an organization centric view that is anchored in the resource-based view and dynamic capabilities. The research contributes to the conversation of human resource co-existence with automated technologies for organizations of tomorrow. Thus, this work specifically contributes to strategic human resource with technology capabilities in organizations.
   Practical implications These research findings would help organizational design and development practitioners to comprehend what kind of interventions would be required to be future ready to both accommodate technology and human resources. For policy makers, the results of this study would help them design policy interventions that could keep the nation's workforce job ready in the age of automated technologies through investments in automated technology education.
   Originality/value India is bestowed with one of the largest English-speaking, technically qualified young workforce working at lower salary levels than their developed county counterparts. The advent of automated technologies ushers in challenges and opportunities for this young qualified workforce to step into future. This is the first study from India that deliberates on the future of work in India.

AB Cryptocurrency is one of the emerging online currency of the modern era. Big companies are investing in this technology. However, some established companies still hesitate to use it. According to them, it is a volatile trend which will fade up eventually. There is no such authority which will provide them feasibility information. So, investors can be helped by providing them feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The crawled data for other cryptocurrencies are much insufficient, so that are excluded from the study. In the proposed methodology, the top locations where cryptocurrency is widely used are identified, then in that particular locations' users concerns along with their sentiment analyses are investigated. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden show positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment which ranks as the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the noteworthy terms found are legitimacy, authorization rules, volatility, profit, investment, and fluctuations. Which describe the users' concerns/ interests' about cryptocurrency. Investors can focus on all these areas during business. These subtopics can help business experts to evolve their businesses' and to make them more sustainable on the basis of public perception.

AB Cryptocurrency is one of the burning issues across the world in the modern era. Literature shows that business analysts always tend to use new technologies and investigate their risks. Some researchers predicted the price fluctuations and investigated the risk of cryptocurrency and blockchain network. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study which provides the feasibility information about locations for cryptocurrency investment around the world. This paper aims to provide the aforementioned information to the investors. The proposed methodology is based on Topic modeling along with public opinion mining about cryptocurrencies, blockchain network, bitcoin, litecoin, and ethereum. The other cryptocurrencies are not included in the study because of having insufficient relevant data on the social forums. Top locations are identified such as Australia, Denmark, Netherlands, and the USA etc. Apart from that, the public perception and environment feasibility are also determined. Almost 83.7% tweets of Sweden shows positive sentiment for cryptocurrency investment. Which ranks the highest having friendly environment for cryptocurrency investment. Similarly, the UK shows the least positive perception of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology usage. Some of the significant terms are also determined using Topic modeling from public opinions. Such as authorization rules, investment, profit, volatility, and security etc. These terms are almost identified as subtopic for each of the inquired keyword. This shows the mutual relationship among different cryptocurrencies and public's concerns about cryptocurrencies.

TI Private Law Regulation of Innovations and Creditors' Rights: What We Can
   Learn from Domain Name Rights for Blockchain Rights
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB The most significant innovation in recent years has been blockchain technology. Such innovations demand a response from the law. The most significant innovation of the last twenty-five years has been the internet. The relative lack of government regulation in the domain of public law has been one of the key features of the internet. The private law regulation of domain name rights has been left to private institutions to arrange this through contract law. Contract law, however, has its limitations when it comes to pledging, seizing and the forced sale of domain name rights. Qualification problems with regard to the nature of domain name rights and the prescribed mode of contract renewal have resulted in difficulties with respect to pledging and seizing domain name rights. These cannot be solved by bottom-up self-regulation. I will demonstrate this by discussing the law in the Belgian, Dutch, German and American jurisdictions. In particular, I will address the unique bottom-up self-regulation of domain name rights in the Netherlands, which aims to replace statutory rules in the field of property law by contractual provisions. Lastly, I will discuss what we can learn from domain name rights for blockchain rights. I will argue that, learning from domain name rights, we should not try to fit in similar issues with regard to blockchain rights in existing private law or contractual arrangements, but should develop tailor-made statutory private law rules so as to avoid the same legal uncertainty as with domain name rights.

AB Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) comprise of a network of physically distributed embedded sensors and actuators equipped with computational and communication capability. In CPS, Internet of Things (IoT) devices communicate in a trustless environment as the data can be compromised due to the centralized database, limited power and computational constraints. At the same time, reliability and resiliency are key concerns in CPS in the face of unforeseen circumstances, often emanating from disaster based failures. In this paper, critical issues of centralized database security in CPS are addressed via a distributed blockchain based solution. The proposed system encompasses a smart contract based framework in Ethereum blockchain. It further explores the potential of blockchain in securing and offering a distributed network for the CPS in a closed loop manner. To demonstrate the realizability of the proposed framework, a testbed implementation for the proposed idea is provided. A desktop computer, a laptop, a simple temperature sensor and a Light Emitting Diode (LED) are interfaced in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network using Ethereum. The speedy transaction of sensor data in the blockchain at various difficulty levels and actuation through smart contracts enhance the usability of the platform for CPS and various IoT applications.

AB Collaboration is a key factor to successful businesses. To face massive competition in which SMEs compete with well established corporates, organizations tend to focus on their core businesses while delegating other tasks to their partners. Lately, Blockchain technology has yet furthered and eased the way companies collaborate in a trust-less environment. As such, interest in researching process collaborations models and techniques has been growing. However, in contrast to BPM research for intra-organizational processes, where a multitude of process models repositories exist as a support for simulation and work evaluation, the lack of such repositories in the context of inter-organizational processes has become an inconvenience. The aim of this paper is to build a repository of collaborative process models that will assist the research in this area. A top-down approach is used to automatically generate constrained and compliant choreography models, from which public and private process models are derived. Though the generation is partly random, it complies to a predefined set of compliance rules and parameters specified by the user.

AB Blockchain technologies and smart contracts were considered for their potential to provide tremendous benefits as decision support tools to the next generation of warfighters. An investigative team focused on novel security-enhanced information gathering and decision support Artificial-Intelligence (AI) based software agents that will serve as decision support co-pilots when commanders are developing real-time multi-domain orders of battle. As a core construct for this architecture, smart contracts allow for the governance of these systems to be time-bound and/or condition-bound. This disruptive technology propels progress made with distributed multi-agent systems with the numerous security benefits of blockchain technologies. Methods for implementing intelligent computing agents that follow and execute the logic embedded in a contract model will provide a transparent record of agents, chain of trust and chain of custody on the blockchain. This paper will explore mechanisms for maintaining a hierarchy of smart contracts allowing reasoning and decision support over different aspects of the overall command structure. Finally, the potential for maintaining multiple levels of classification across communication channels for platforms tasked with collection and reconnaissance missions will explored.

AB Blockchain protocols are based on a distributed database where stored data is guaranteed to be immutable. The requirement that all nodes have to maintain their own local copy of the database ensures security while consensus mechanisms help deciding which data gets added to the database and keep powerful adversaries from derailing the system. However, since the database that forms the foundation of a blockchain is a continuously growing list of blocks, scalability is an inherent problem of this technology. Some public blockchains need a few 100 GB to Terabytes of storage.
   In this work, we present the concept Superlight with self-contained proofs, which is designed to improve scalability of a public blockchain, while preserving security and decentralization. Instead of all nodes having a local copy of the whole blockchain to verify a transaction, nodes can derive the validity of a transaction by only using block headers. To keep the block headers compact, BLS signatures are used to combine signatures. We provide a definition of SCPs and show the required steps of a client to create a proof that is accepted by other nodes for transferring funds. The advantage of such a light-client-only blockchain is the lower storage requirement, while the drawback is an increased computational complexity due to BLS signatures, limited use-cases due to lack of a global state, and the requirement for an interactive protocol between sender, receiver, and miner to create a transaction.

AB Purpose: The purpose of the article is to develop a strategy of provision of security of wireless future of digital economy. Methodology: The author determines, analyzes, and compares scenarios of wireless future of digital economy depending on completeness of provision of security, with the help of the methods of logical and problem analysis and imitation modeling. Results: As a result of modeling the wireless future of digital economy, the risks to security, causes of their emergence (factors that require management), and perspectives of risk management are determined. A strategy of provision of security of wireless future of digital economy is presented-it reflects the structure of risk management of this process through the prism of its subjects and performed functions, as well as the tools that include robototronics, cloud and blockchain technologies, and human monitoring of digital devices. Implementation of this strategy will allow reducing the risk component of functioning and development of digital economy, its quick growth and stimulation of social progress (increase of population's living standards)-i.e., implementation of the optimistic scenario. Recommendations: As a result, it is concluded that even in case of highly-effective risk management there preserves a rather high level of risk of provision of security of digital economy's wireless future. Thus, with digital modernization of modern socio-economic systems together with practical implementation of the offered strategy of provision of security of digital economy's wireless future, it is recommended to conduct measures for reducing the level of social tension and preventing the opposition to changes.

AB Blockchain proved to be more than the technology behind Bitcoin: transparency, durability and distributed data access are features potentially useful in various fields. The need for a modern and improved public sector is often connected with a call for a transformation increasingly centered on the system of relations with its external stakeholders. Thus, the organizational change is no longer confined only to its internal management systems. The new challenges of public sector require a new way of organizing relationships with multiple actors, employed in various capacities in the political and organizational processes that the single PA should manage. To this aim, public administration change and innovation might be based on a collective process through which relationships and actors' opportunities arise and blockchain could support and sometimes enable this kind of transformation.

The results of the research of the awareness of market participants regarding the advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency and the presence of interest in the usage of cryptocurrency are given. The aim of this article is to study the possibilities of using cryptocurrency for economic development. The object of the research is the process of using cryptocurrency in the market in Ukraine, taking into account world experience. Practical implications. The results of a study of the demand for cryptocurrency in Ukraine. The research was conducted with the help of a questionnaire, as a result of which it was found out: the level of awareness of cryptocurrency; subjective perception of cryptocurrency; sources of awareness of cryptocurrency; the presence of the potential interest of Ukrainians in the acquisition of cryptocurrency. It was found what exactly Ukrainians consider the main advantages and disadvantages of cryptocurrency. Value/originality. Cryptocurrency as a means of payment and a type of electronic money is found in the most countries of the world in the "grey" zone, and regulators, if not prohibit, then at least do not recommend citizens to invest in such assets. However, the state of science and technology development of blockchain technologies, which are the basis of cryptocurrency, and the state of demand for cryptocurrency in the Ukrainian market are ready to use cryptocurrency. For the effective implementation of cryptocurrency, Ukraine lacks only the normative framework. Developing a regulatory framework in this area will help to bring cryptocurrency markets to stability. The introduction of international experience in the usage of cryptocurrency in Ukraine, the creation of own model of behaviour will be the first step towards building a transparent and understandable cryptocurrency market, which will lead to the development of the economy as a whole.

AB Food products are one of most important elements in the international commerce. They are also one of the most regulated markets, both at national and international level. The potential damage that inadequate food products may cause in the economy, public health or natural environment of any country turns them into a very controlled commercial flow. However, methodologies, processes and instruments to apply these controls and trace the flow of food products through the several countries and states they can pass, are very complex and inefficient. Cultural and administrate problems, language conflicts or lost documents are only some of the main issues future digital food technologies should address. Therefore, in this paper it is proposed a traceability system for food products in the international commerce, based on Blockchain networks and RFID tags. Using REST interfaces, NoSQL databases and Java-Script code it is implemented a distributed solution to collect, sign and store trustworthy information about the food product flow. A security system is also deployed to guarantee the fault-resilience and the access only by authorized users to the system. A first implementation of the proposed system is also described in order to validate the described solution.

AB We have been involved in the development of several blockchain-based solutions that largely utilize workflows. Workflows are used to guide users from independent organizations to process and manage transactions, data and documents in a trusted, immutable, and transparent manner for all relevant entities on a given blockchain network. This work discusses our approach to automate the process of creating, updating, and using workflows for blockchain-based solutions. In particular, we present a workflow definition schema using existing templates. We also show how the workflow definition is used to automate the generation of graphical user interfaces and the possibility of generating associated blockchain smart contracts in the future.

AB Policy decisions are increasingly dependent on the outcomes of simulations and/or machine learning models. The ability to share and interact with these outcomes is relevant across multiple fields and is especially critical in the disease modeling community where models are often only accessible and workable to the researchers that generate them. This work presents a blockchain-enabled system that establishes a decentralized trust between parties involved in a modeling process. Utilizing the OpenMalaria framework, we demonstrate the ability to store, share and maintain auditable logs and records of each step in the simulation process, showing how to validate results generated by computational workers. We also show how the system monitors worker outputs to rank and identify faulty workers via comparison to nearest neighbors or historical reward spaces as a means of ensuring model quality.

TI Dextt: Deterministic Cross-Blockchain Token Transfers
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Current blockchain technologies provide very limited interoperability. Restrictions with regard to asset transfers and data exchange between different blockchains reduce the usability and comfort of users, and hinder novel developments within the blockchain space. As a first step towards blockchain interoperability, we propose the DeXTT cross-blockchain transfer protocol, which can be used to record a token transfer on any number of blockchains simultaneously in a decentralized manner. We provide a reference implementation using Solidity, and evaluate its performance. We show logarithmic scalability of DeXTT with respect to the number of participating nodes, and analyze cost requirements of the transferred tokens.

AB The 3XORSUM problem aims to find (x, y,z) such that x + y + z = 0 over {0,1}(d); with each variable drawn from one of 3 randomly generated lists. In addition to being of interest in its own right, this problem has cryptographic applications including proof of stake methods in Blockchain.
   The 3XORSUM problem is also related to the integer 3SUM problem from theoretical computer science on which there is extensive recent literature. It is conjectured that the integer 3SUM problem has complexity (Omega) over tilde (n(2)) for lists of size O(n).
   Wagner [10] has presented an algorithm with complexity (O) over tilde (2(d/3)) for finding a 4XORSUM solution (x + y + z + w = 0) with each variable drawn from one of 4 randomly generated lists of size O(2(d/3)) with members from {0,1}(d).
   We present an algorithm which solves the 3XORSUM problem for randomly generated binary vectors from {0,1}(d) with time and memory complexity (O) over tilde (n) = (O) over tilde (2(d/3)). This substantially improves results from [1], [8]. Our algorithm has applications to blockchains and other cryptographic problems.

AB This article describes an environment for knowledge acquisition, learning, use and collaboration inter-agents over Internet Infrastructure. Four agent types previously used in a applied fourtier model, such as the use case on the Internet Routing Registry. This model, which can be implemented in each Autonomous System domain of the Internet infrastructure, is integrated into an environment (a) capturing information from unstructured databases, (b) creating and updating training bases appropriate to machine learning algorithms and (c) creating and feeding of a knowledge base. Such resources become readily available to agents in each domain and to agents in all other domains with the aim of making them autonomous. The agents collaborate and interact with each other, through individual blockchain structures that also take care of operational security and integration aspects. In addition, a testbed to validate the entire model, including the functionalities of the agents, is also proposed and characterized.

The answer could be provided by means of the adoption model of Blockchain technologies for this purpose, applied to the different characteristics of the city from the electronic governance, the contracting of products and services, and the sensing or data collection. The multiple IoT objects and the multiple networks, together with the Blockchain technology, may result in safer and more efficient cities. This paper analyzes and deepens the concept of Smart Cities using Blockchain technology as a platform for safety and reliability of the data. It is intended to reflect critically on this topic, looking through the different aspects involving this concept and the way in which it can implement. It analyzes the Smart Cities and its ecosystems with the generic data models, integrated, with quality data and trusted information.

AB We consider fault-tolerant boolean formulas in which the output of a faulty gate is short-circuited to one of the gate's inputs. A recent result by Kalai et al. [FOCS 2012] converts any boolean formula into a resilient formula of polynomial size that works correctly if less than a fraction 1/6 of the gates (on every input-to-output path) are faulty. We improve the result of Kalai et al., and show how to efficiently fortify any boolean formula against a fraction 1/5 of short-circuit gates per path, with only a polynomial blowup in size. We additionally show that it is impossible to obtain formulas with higher resilience and sub-exponential growth in size.
   Towards our results, we consider interactive coding schemes when noiseless feedback is present; these produce resilient boolean formulas via a Karchmer-Wigderson relation. We develop a coding scheme that resists up to a fraction 1/5 of corrupted transmissions in each direction of the interactive channel. We further show that such a level of noise is maximal for coding schemes with sub-exponential blowup in communication. Our coding scheme takes a surprising inspiration from Blockchain technology.

AB New Public Governance (NPG) as a paradigm for collaborative forms of public service delivery and Blockchain governance are trending topics for researchers and practitioners alike. Thus far, each topic has, on the whole, been discussed separately. This paper presents the preliminary results of ongoing research which aims to shed light on the more concrete benefits of Blockchain for the purpose of NPG. For the first time, a conceptual analysis is conducted on process level to spot benefits and limitations of Blockchain-based governance. Per process element, Blockchain key characteristics are mapped to functional aspects of NPG from a governance perspective. The preliminary results show that Blockchain offers valuable support for governments seeking methods to effectively coordinate co-producing networks. However, the extent of benefits of Blockchain varies across the process elements. It becomes evident that there is a need for off-chain processes. It is, therefore, argued in favour of intensifying research on off-chain governance processes to better understand the implications for and influences on on-chain governance.

AB The security of most existing cryptocurrencies is based on a concept called Proof-of-Work, in which users must solve a computationally hard cryptopuzzle to authorize transactions ("one unit of computation, one vote"). This leads to enormous expenditure on hardware and electricity in order to collect the rewards associated with transaction authorization. Proof-of-Stake is an alternative concept that instead selects users to authorize transactions proportional to their wealth ("one coin, one vote"). Some aspects of the two paradigms are the same. For instance, obtaining voting power in Proof-of-Stake has a monetary cost just as in Proof-of-Work: a coin cannot be freely duplicated any more easily than a unit of computation. However some aspects are fundamentally different. In particular, exactly because Proof-of-Stake is wasteless, there is no inherent resource cost to deviating (commonly referred to as the "Nothing-at-Stake" problem).
   In contrast to prior work, we focus on incentive-driven deviations (any participant will deviate if doing so yields higher revenue) instead of adversarial corruption (an adversary may take over a significant fraction of the network, but the remaining players follow the protocol). The main results of this paper are several formal barriers to designing incentive-compatible proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies (that don't apply to proof-of-work).

AB The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) negotiated and administered by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) regulates the international trade of endangered species and derived products through a permit-based system. Currently, the permit process is paper-based and hence highly prone to manipulations and errors. Being aware of blockchains' potential, the CITES Secretariat defined a challenge to determine whether a blockchain-based system can address the aforementioned issues and serve as a secure, efficient, and affordable permit processing system.
   In this paper, we respond to the CITES Blockchain Challenge. First, we analyze the permit process and discuss how blockchain systems can improve that process in a way traditional systems cannot. Building on these results, we design a blockchain-based system that enables secure, manipulation- resistant permit validation, produces an immutable record of processed permits, and is in compliance with the CITES agreement. To evaluate this design, we developed a proof-of-concept implementation compatible with the paper-based permit process and deployed it to a Proof-of-Authority-based blockchain network. This allows incremental adoption and integration with the existing process, thereby increasing acceptance and addressing affordability. Finally, we describe how a blockchain- based system could disruptively improve the established permit process by enforcing quotas and tracking provenance.

TI Privacy Management in Social Internet of Vehicles: Review, Challenges

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has integrated the sensor network silos to the Internet and enabled the provision of value-added services across these networks. These smart devices are now becoming socially conscious by following the social Internet of Things (SIoT) model that empowers them to create and maintain social relationships among them. The Social Internet of Vehicle (SIoV) is one application of SIoT in the vehicular domain that has evolved the existing intelligent transport system (ITS) and vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) to the next phase of Intelligent by adding socializing aspect and constant connectivity. SIoV generates a massive amount of real-time data enriched with context and social relationship information about vehicles, drivers, passengers, and the surrounding environment. Therefore, the role of privacy management becomes essential in SIoV, as data is collected and stored at different layers of its architecture. The challenge of privacy is aggravated because the dynamic nature of SIoV poses a major threat in its adoption. Motivated by the need to address these aspects, this paper identifies the challenges involved in managing privacy in SIoV. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the privacy issues and factors that are essential to be considered for preserving privacy in SIoV environments from different perspectives including the privacy of a person, behavior and action, communication, data and image, thoughts and feelings, location and space, and association. In addition, the paper discusses the blockchain-based solutions to preserve privacy for SIoV.

AB Modern cybercrimes have exponentially grown over the last one decade. Ransomware is one of the types of malware which is the result of sophisticated attempt to compromise the modern computer systems. The governments and large corporations are investing heavily to combat this cyber threat against their critical infrastructure. It has been observed that over the last few years that Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have become the main target of Ransomware due to the sensitive operations involved in the day to day processes of these industries. As the technology is evolving, more and more traditional industrial systems are replaced with advanced industry methods involving advanced technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT). These technology shift help improve business productivity and keep the company's global competitive in an overflowing competitive market. However, the systems involved need secure measures to protect integrity and availability which will help avoid any malfunctioning to their operations due to the cyber-attacks. There have been several cyber-attack incidents on healthcare, pharmaceutical, water cleaning and energy sector. These ICS's are operated by remote control facilities and variety of other devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLC) and sensors to make a network. Cyber criminals are exploring vulnerabilities in the design of these ICS's to take the command and control of these systems and disrupt daily operations until ransomware is paid. This paper will provide critical analysis of the impact of Ransomware threat on SCADA systems.

Volatility may be influenced by speculators. The wealthy must divide their assets between the home currency and the cryptocurrency, while the government decides the probability of seizing a fraction the assets of this group. We establish conditions for existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria. Also examined is the separate timescale problem in which the government policy cannot be reversed, while the wealthy can adjust their allocation in reaction to the government's designation of probability.

TI A dynamical systems approach to cryptocurrency stability
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Recently, the notion of cryptocurrencies has come to the fore of public interest. These assets that exist only in electronic form, with no underlying value, offer the owners some protection from tracking or seizure by government or creditors. We model these assets from the perspective of asset flow equations developed by Caginalp and Balenovich, and investigate their stability under various parameters, as classical finance methodology is inapplicable. By utilizing the concept of liquidity price and analyzing stability of the resulting system of ordinary differential equations, we obtain conditions under which the system is linearly stable. We find that trend-based motivations and additional liquidity arising from an uptrend are destabilizing forces, while anchoring through value assumed to be fairly recent price history tends to be stabilizing.

TI Analysis of Blockchain System With Token-Based Bookkeeping Method
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We propose a token-based blockchain system that streamlines abstractions into a universal token structure. In the proposed system, each token has an identity that enables the implementation of specific rollbacks and governance that make 51% attacks unprofitable. Because the token-based bookkeeping method only verifies and updates the ownership within each transaction, the proposed system supports parallel expansion and cross-chain transactions without limit. The flexible authority management mechanism of the proposed system is regulatory-friendly, as the intensity of supervision and governance can be adapted to accommodate different application scenarios.

TI Crypto-miners: Digital labor and the power of blockchain technology
SO ECONOMIC ANTHROPOLOGY
AB This article examines the labor power of digital miners. Though an obscure and still incipient facet of the digital economy, crypto-mining powers and secures transactions across blockchains, or public distributed digital ledgers. Drawing from interviews with cryptocurrency enthusiasts, blockchain advocates, and developers; participation in online and offline discussions; and a survey with small-scale crypto-miners, this article takes on the material and technoscientific valuation of crypto-mining to understand how a future of open, decentralized accountability implicates human labor alongside automated processes. The work of digital mining, performed in the work of inscribing, registering, and politically organizing mining operations, enables the formation of democratic communities in the digital economy and remains inevitably embedded in social relations as a mode of productive, meaningful action.

AB The innovative creation of cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology brings possibility for operating business in a decentralized community with reduced friction. But current business development on the blockchain platform is dragged by slow progress in technique, ill-designed economic mechanism, and difficult fund-raising procedure. Based on the analysis about major defects of Bitcoin's economic mechanism and the typical fund-raising methods in this field, we proposed a value-backed economic mechanism which has a clear separation of tokens' attributes as well as a reasonable distribution rule of profit. Rather than issuing a token with both utility and financing attributes at the very beginning, a utility token with a warrant attribute is introduced to stimulate and facilitate the value exchange between miners and other participants. After the business has become mature enough, token holders can redeem certain security tokens and start to enjoy dividends and other rights as a shareholder. In this way, speculation and fraud risks can be dramatically reduced, benefiting both project developers and investors.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING
AB Knowledge society blockchain is one of the most powerful and recent tools to make the internet environment safer and reliable. Manufacturing has traditionally been dominated by standard designs that are mass-produced, due to the fact, that custom production causes additional costs that make it less affordable than mass production. This paper proposes to develop a designer expert system for IoT installation layout designs, using blockchain distributed system based on a machine learning, with users entering data to the expert system by a smart bot software. This expert system will work using extreme learning machine as inference engine; therefore, this is a shell to develop any expert system with fast learning. The whole system is represented by a smart contract with a value linked to the value of the expert system, the more this expert system be quoted on the web, the more the shares of the smart contract will cost.

AB Money has remained closely connected to political sovereignty even as polities changed from empires and kingdoms to dictatorships and democracies, and as money shifted from coin to paper and now to digital currency. Money constitutes a claim on value in exchange and a store and measure of value, so we consider the role law plays in these three articulations between money and value. We examine research on different instances of legal control over official currency, monetary innovations, standards of monetary measurement and valuation, counterfeiting, terror financing, and money laundering to show how the relationship between money and law has evolved in response to changes in international law, national sovereignty, and global markets.

However, the problem is how to ensure that all the data transmitted by the grid is authentic and has not been modified in any way. This paper presents a model for increasing communication security in the power system grid. For this purpose, blockchain is used to store all communication data, blockchain is distributed, secure and reliable. The main goal is that information is protected in the blockchain against modification attempts. In addition, power source can be authenticated and tracked from the consumer to the source.

AB Nowadays, Wireless Sensors Network (WSN) sensors lose accuracy in their measurements. This address two problems that have a direct influence on monitoring and control that WSN performs. The first one is data collected by the WSN from inaccurate sensors. And secondly, high maintenance cost of WSN if it is not known exactly which sensors are inaccurate. In this paper we propose a stochastic model using Blockchain to predict the degradation of sensor accuracy, knowing its current state. The expected results are the prediction with a high degree of accuracy that sensors will be inaccurate in the near future in order to perform proper maintenance and maintain data quality.

AB The market of virtual currencies, called cryptocurrency, has grown immensely since 2008 in terms of market capitalisation and the numbers of new currencies. Bitcoin is one of the most famous cryptocurrency with an estimated market capitalisation of nearly $ 69 billion. The fact that Bitcoin prices have fallen about 70% from their peak value and most indices were down double-digit year to date (2018) with a high daily volatility create the appearance that there has to be a correlation.
   The purpose of this paper is to investigate the contagion effect between Bitcoin prices and the leading American, European and Asian equity markets using the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model proposed by Engle and Sheppard (2001).
   Contagion is defined in this context as the statistical break in the computed DCCs as measured by the shifts in their means and medians. Even it is astonishing that the contagion is lower during price bubbles, the main finding indicates the presence of contagion in the different indices among the three continents and proves the presence of structural changes during the Bitcoin bubble. Moreover, the analysis shows that specific market indices are more correlated with the Bitcoin price than others.

AB Number of devices using Internet is increasing every day and this fact makes the need to improve the Internet of things protocol more than ever. Data protection and privacy is one of the key challenges in the Internet of Things technology. Dangers involved in the centralized technology of Blockchain system have led to the idea of using Tangle, which is a decentralized system. The main purpose of this new technology is to improve the problems and limitations of Blockchain such as high cost and time to confirm a transaction. In this new architecture, every node is involved in maintaining network security. This way, if a transaction is created, then it should select and confirm two unconfirmed transactions issued before. A walking algorithm is needed for this selection. Walking algorithms presented in literature thus far are either weighted or unweighted. An unweighted random walk algorithm can approve transactions nearly proportional to the time of their arrivals while a weighted algorithm can better defend against lazy and malicious transactions. In this paper, a new random walk algorithm is presented that has the benefits of both algorithms at the same time. The idea is to adapt the weight value to the current situation of transactions. Numerical results have shown the superiority of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the existing algorithms in providing a balance between timeliness of approving transactions and protecting against malicious activities.

AB The emerging blockchain technology provides a new paradigm for maintaining data integrity and unforgeability in a distributed manner. However conventional public blockchain systems suffer large consensus latency thus cannot be well applied to Internet of Vehicles (IoV) with the high mobility of vehicles and low latency requirement. In addition, not all messages in IoV should be stored in a global ledger. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Blockchain (HB) which divides the system into two layers and each layer maintains an exclusive ledger. Sensing informal' of vehicles are recorded in differnet layer according to its influence scope. Furthermore, based on the transactions recorded in the hierarchical blockchain, we design the proactive file duplicate caching scheme considering not only popularities but influence scopes for the enhancement of overall system performance. Simulation results shows the superiority of the proposed architecture compared with conventional vehicular systems, in terms of failure rate, latency and system utility.

AB Delay tolerant network (DTN) is successfully proposed for setting up emergency post disaster communication networks when normal communication infrastructure is incapacitated. Performance of such networks get affected by selfish nodes that do not participate in message forwarding. Thus, nodes must receive satisfactory rewards for cooperation. The available incentive schemes either rely on central trusted authorities or do not use an explicit and secure digital currency. Blockchain, a decentralized digital ledger of immutable transactions, is an attractive approach for addressing the incentive challenges in peer-to-peer networks that lack central trusted authorities. Bitcoin, the Blockchain based cryptocurrency, make it possible to devise practical credit based incentive schemes for such networks. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain based incentive scheme for DTN based post disaster communication network that uses Bitcoin to incentivize nodes for cooperation. The scheme uses a novel reward strategy to bring rationality in the incentivizing process.

AB Blockchain the technology of the decade which has disrupted the complete technological sector and moreover has plotted its jurisdiction over almost all other industrial sectors with a significant coefficient. The credit industry in terms of credit cards and also the credit system of the financial supply chain management proves to be one of the competent use cases for the blockchain technology to be tendered upon. In the credit card-based system the structure terms to be quite complicated and also there are a lot of challenges in order to pass a credit fund to a particular customer and also there are huge processing and validation charges that are levied upon. Moreover, the financial organization which is responsible for dedicating a card to the user for smooth processing of the credit funds, also has to fulfil some tenacious check on the customers where the verification procedure lies into multiple segments to determine the pay term history, CIBIL Score and also the capability of the customer to pay out the credit funds. Also, in the financial supply chain management, the credit system is indeed one of the toughest systems to be managed as in Financial Supply Chain Management (FSCM), the transactions are not in lower dimensions of few hundred thousand dollars rather are in millions and billions. Also, in the credit system of the FSCM, the credit exposure or the limit of a particular client is dynamic and the credit limit or exposure depends upon a wide variance of factors such as previous pay term history, average days past due, average term revenue, and revenue insurance. Moreover, the analysis and the validation of the capability of the customer to pay a certain amount is quite a time intensive and depends upon variables from numerous sectors. Therefore, a blockchain based environment may allow to assess the eligibility of a customer over the order limit or credit limit that have been demanded. Hence a blockchain based credit analysis framework can be very useful for gathering information about the customers from multiple financial sectors, analysis of the eligibility of the customer to stand the credit and to calculate the credit score of the customers based on the consensus of multiple stakeholders in the network including banks, insurance agencies and other third-party financial organizations

AB Blockchain, the technology of the future neutrally facilitated the financial transactions in cryptocurrencies by strictly eliminating the need for a governing authority or a management that was required to authorize the transactions based on trust and transparency. The Blockchain Network also follows the principle of absolute privacy and anonymity on the identification of the users associated in a transaction. Since the time of its inception, the Blockchain Technology has undergone research that has demonstrated some various kinds of methods to sort out the access control system of the conventional system. In recent years Blockchain has also shown optimum reliability in multiple sectors such as Smart Home, Healthcare, Banking, Information Storage Management, Security and etc. This work in terms is further concerned to the sector of Smart Healthcare, which has grown to a much affluence regarding the efficient technique of serving and dictating medical health care to the patients with the point of maintaining privacy of the patients' data and also the process of laying out real time accurate and trusted data to the medical practitioners. But in the scenario of Smart Healthcare, the primary concern arises in the fact of Privacy and Security of the data of the patients due to the interoperability of multiple stakeholders in the process. Also, there has been a fact of determining accurate and proper data to the doctors if the concerned subject is out of reach from the in hand medical service. Therefore, this Concern of privacy and also mitigation of the accurate data has been very much managed in the work by regulating, a monitoring and sensing paradigm with accordance to the IOT and the Blockchain as a transaction and access management system and also an appropriate medium for laying out accurate and trusted data for serving with deliberate medical care and benefits to the patients across.

AB State Machine Replication (SMR) is an important abstraction for a set of nodes to agree on an ever-growing, linearly-ordered log of transactions. In decentralized cryptocurrency applications, we would like to design SMR protocols that (1) resist adaptive corruptions; and (2) achieve small bandwidth and small confirmation time. All past approaches towards constructing SMR fail to achieve either small confirmation time or small bandwidth under adaptive corruptions (without resorting to strong assumptions such as the erasure model or proof-of-work).
   We propose a novel paradigm for reaching consensus that departs significantly from classical approaches. Our protocol is inspired by a social phenomenon called herding, where people tend to make choices considered as the social norm. In our consensus protocol, leader election and voting are coalesced into a single (randomized) process: in every round, every node tries to cast a vote for what it views as the most popular item so far: such a voting attempt is not always successful, but rather, successful with a certain probability. Importantly, the probability that the node is elected to vote for v is independent from the probability it is elected to vote for v' not equal v. We will show how to realize such a distributed, randomized election process using appropriate, adaptively secure cryptographic building blocks.
   We show that amazingly, not only can this new paradigm achieve consensus (e.g., on a batch of unconfirmed transactions in a cryptocurrency system), but it also allows us to derive the first SMR protocol which, even under adaptive corruptions, requires only polylogarithmically many rounds and polylogarithmically many honest messages to be multicast to confirm each batch of transactions; and importantly, we attain these guarantees under standard cryptographic assumptions.

AB Permissioned blockchains have evolved as an alternative to permissionless blockchains for various closed business environments. In this paper, we develop FRChain, a scalable and high-performant consensus protocol for permissioned blockchains, which is resilient to different types of node and network failures. FRChain uses collective signing over multicast trees for block propagation and block validation. The protocol ensures safety and liveness as long as a majority of the nodes can participate in the protocol correctly. Further, we also demonstrate a technique for replacing failed nodes with correct ones. We have implemented and tested FRChain spread across a 5000 node blockchain network over two different data centers - (a) 35 Softlayer Cloud VMs located across Melbourne, Milan and San Jose, (b) Amazon VPC with 30 Amazon EC2 instances spread across Mumbai, Singapore, Tokyo and Frankfurt. Our experiments show that FRChain is scalable in terms of both transaction throughput and network size.

AB We developed a blockchain-based E-marketplace. A decentralized E-marketplace platform utilizing the blockchain technology is implemented. We use the self-enforcement of smart contracts to secure the deposit and process the payment. Each transaction is verified through the blockchain and is recorded to the decentralized ledger. This enables trustless transactions since the smart contract is self-executed. The smart contract is able to perform credible transactions without trusted third parties, and the transactions on the blockchain are trackable and irreversible. Therefore, both the buyer and the seller cannot breach the contract. All processes are recorded on the blockchain including the product launch, purchase, delivery, and payment. It is trackable and could be submitted to courts as electronic evidence to solve the transaction disputes.

TI Blockchain for the IoT: Privacy-Preserving Protection of Sensor Data
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB An ever growing variety of smart, connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices poses completely new challenges for businesses regarding security and privacy. In fact, the adoption of smart products may depend on the ability of organizations to offer systems that ensure adequate sensor data integrity while guaranteeing sufficient user privacy. In light of these challenges, previous research indicates that blockchain technology could be a promising means to mitigate issues of data security arising in the IoT. Building upon the existing body of knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. To support this, we designed and developed an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three iterative cycles intented to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of car mileage data. Following the explication of our SDPS, we provide an ex post evaluation of our design theory considering CertifiCar and two additional use cases in the areas of pharmaceutical supply chains and energy microgrids. Our results suggest that the proposed design ensures the tamper-resistant gathering, processing, and exchange of IoT sensor data in a privacy-preserving, scalable, and efficient manner.

AB ICOs (Initial Coin Offering) have recently become the favorite fund raising method for entrepreneurs and startups. Research indicates that a successful ICO could provide a helpful precedence for those who are in need of raising funds in the near future. In addition, the results could help the regulatory authorities identify the elements and factors which should be taken into consideration if ICOs were subject to regulation. The purpose of this study is to discover the factors which may affect the success of an ICO from 533 ICO samples which successfully raised over 5 million US dollars during the past two-year period. In general, we found that the following elements of ICOs have significant positive correlation to the final amount of fund raised, including, a higher amount of total token supply, acceptance of fiat as consideration in exchange for tokens, using the USA as an issue country, a higher percentage of token allocation to subscribers, a higher percentage of token allocation to advisors, a higher percentage of token allocation to ecosystem development, and introducing a post-ICO bonus scheme. On the contrary, we found that the following have a negative correlation to the final amount of the fund raised in an ICO: making use of bonus schemes in the ICO process, and applying longer lock-up periods in an ICO. We hope the research result will provide a new perspective for fund raisers and the government authorities.

AB In today's programmable blockchains, smart contracts are limited to being deterministic and non-probabilistic. This lack of randomness is a consequential limitation, given that a wide variety of real-world financial contracts, such as casino games and lotteries, depend entirely on randomness. As a result, several ad-hoc random number generation approaches have been developed to be used in smart contracts. These include ideas such as using an oracle or relying on the block hash. However, these approaches are manipulatable, i.e. their output can be tampered with by parties who might not be neutral, such as the owner of the oracle or the miners.
   We propose a novel game-theoretic approach for generating provably unmanipulatable pseudorandom numbers on the blockchain. Our approach allows smart contracts to access a trustworthy source of randomness that does not rely on potentially compromised miners or oracles, hence enabling the creation of a new generation of smart contracts that are not limited to being non-probabilistic and can be drawn from the much more general class of probabilistic programs.

AB In today's cryptocurrencies, Hashcash proof of work is the most commonly-adopted approach to mining. In Hashcash, when a miner decides to add a block to the chain, she has to solve the difficult computational puzzle of inverting a hash function. While Hashcash has been successfully adopted in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, it has attracted significant and harsh criticism due to its massive waste of electricity, its carbon footprint and environmental effects, and the inherent lack of usefulness in inverting a hash function. Various other mining protocols have been suggested, including proof of stake, in which a miner's chance of adding the next block is proportional to her current balance. However, such protocols lead to a higher entry cost for new miners who might not still have any stake in the cryptocurrency, and can in the worst case lead to an oligopoly, where the rich have complete control over mining.
   In this paper, we propose Hybrid Mining: a new mining protocol that combines solving real-world useful problems with Hashcash. Our protocol allows new miners to join the network by taking part in Hashcash mining without having to own an initial stake. It also allows nodes of the network to submit hard computational problems whose solutions are of interest in the real world, e.g. protein folding problems. Then, miners can choose to compete in solving these problems, in lieu of Hashcash, for adding a new block. Hence, Hybrid Mining incentivizes miners to solve useful problems, such as hard computational problems arising in biology, in a distributed manner. It also gives researchers in other areas an easy-to-use tool to outsource their hard computations to the blockchain network, which has enormous computational power, by paying a reward to the miner who solves the problem for them. Moreover, our protocol provides strong security guarantees and is at least as resilient to double spending as Bitcoin.

AB Smart contracts are programs that are stored and executed on the Blockchain and can receive, manage and transfer money (cryptocurrency units). Two important problems regarding smart contracts are formal analysis and compiler optimization. Formal analysis is extremely important, because smart contracts hold funds worth billions of dollars and their code is immutable after deployment. Hence, an undetected bug can cause significant financial losses. Compiler optimization is also crucial, because every action of a smart contract has to be executed by every node in the Blockchain network. Therefore, optimizations in compiling smart contracts can lead to significant savings in computation, time and energy.
   Two classical approaches in program analysis and compiler optimization are intraprocedural and interprocedural analysis. In intraprocedural analysis, each function is analyzed separately, while interprocedural analysis considers the entire program. In both cases, the analyses are usually reduced to graph problems over the control flow graph (CFG) of the program. These graph problems are often computationally expensive. Hence, there has been ample research on exploiting structural properties of CFGs for efficient algorithms. One such well-studied property is the treewidth, which is a measure of tree-likeness of graphs. It is known that intraprocedural CFGs of structured programs have treewidth at most 6, whereas the interprocedural treewidth cannot be bounded. This result has been used as a basis for many efficient intraprocedural analyses.
   In this paper, we explore the idea of exploiting the treewidth of smart contracts for formal analysis and compiler optimization. First, similar to classical programs, we show that the intraprocedural treewidth of structured Solidity and Vyper smart contracts is at most 9. Second, for global analysis, we prove that the interprocedural treewidth of structured smart contracts is bounded by 10 and, in sharp contrast with classical programs, treewidth-based algorithms can be easily applied for interprocedural analysis. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with experiments using a tool we implemented for computing treewidth of smart contracts and show that the treewidth is much lower in practice. We use 36,764 real-world Ethereum smart contracts as benchmarks and find that they have an average treewidth of at most 3.35 for the intraprocedural case and 3.65 for the interprocedural case.

TI Assessment of a Simulated Case-Based Measurement of Physician Diagnostic
   Performance
SO JAMA NETWORK OPEN
AB IMPORTANCE Diagnostic acumen is a fundamental skill in the practice of medicine. Scalable, practical, and objective tools to assess diagnostic performance are lacking.
   OBJECTIVE To validate a new method of assessing diagnostic performance that uses automated techniques to assess physicians' diagnostic performance on brief, open-ended case simulations.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 11 023 unique attempts to solve case simulations on an online software platform, The Human Diagnosis Project (Human Dx). A total of 1738 practicing physicians, residents (internal medicine, family medicine, and emergency medicine), and medical students throughout the United States voluntarily used Human Dx software between January 21, 2016, and January 15, 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Internal structure validity was assessed by 3 measures of diagnostic performance: accuracy, efficiency, and a combined score (Diagnostic Acumen Precision Performance [DAPP]). These were each analyzed by level of training. Association with other variables' validity evidence was evaluated by correlating diagnostic performance and affiliation with an institution ranked in the top 25 medical schools by US News and World Report.
   RESULTS Data were analyzed for 239 attending physicians, 926 resident physicians, 347 intern physicians, and 226 medical students. Attending physicians had higher mean accuracy scores than medical students (difference, 8.1; 95% CI, 4.2-12.0; P<.001), as did residents (difference, 8.0; 95% CI, 4.8-11.2; P<.001) and interns (difference, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.3-9.6; P<.001). Attending physicians had higher mean efficiency compared with residents (difference, 4.8; 95% CI, 1.8-7.8; P<.001), interns (difference, 5.0; 95% CI, 1.5-8.4; P=.001), and medical students (difference, 5.4; 95% CI, 1.4-9.3; P=.003). Attending physicians also had significantly higher mean DAPP scores than residents (difference, 2.6; 95% CI, 0.0-5.2; P=.05), interns (difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.6-6.6; P=.01), and medical students (difference, 6.7; 95% CI, 3.3-10.2; P<.001). Attending physicians affiliated with a US News andWorld Report-ranked institution had higher mean DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated attending physicians (80 [95% CI, 77-83] vs 72 [95% CI, 70-74], respectively; P<.001). Resident physicians affiliated with an institution ranked in the top 25 medical schools by US News andWorld Report also had higher mean DAPP scores compared with nonaffiliated peers (75 [95% CI, 73-77] vs 71 [95% CI, 69-72], respectively; P<.001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The data suggest that diagnostic performance is higher in those with more training and that DAPP scores may be a valid measure to appraise diagnostic performance. This diagnostic assessment tool allows individuals to receive immediate feedback on performance through an openly accessible online platform.

AB Blockchain technology and other distributed ledger systems fill an important role in resilient data storage and publication. However, their normally-decentralized methods also bring unique challenges distinct from more traditional approaches. One lies in the replication of data between participating nodes; since no individual node is more trusted than any other, each node maintains its own copy of the entire ledger for the purposes of validating new transactions. Improving how this information is stored and more importantly, how it propagates across the network, are open research questions. In this work, we propose Velocity, a novel block propagation approach based on fountain codes, allowing for better decentralized delivery of blocks and reduced network bottlenecks without sacrificing the security guarantees of the blockchain ledger itself. We also provide an assessment of economic incentives and their impact on participant behavior, showing that the proposed approach is financially beneficial to rational actors. We conclude by showing experimentally that this approach permits for the mining of even larger blocks, thereby increasing transaction throughput of the system compared to existing state of the art methods.

AB Several IoT applications are tightly dependent on the locations of the devices. However, localization algorithms can be easily compromised by injecting false locations. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based secure localization algorithm for the Internet of Things (IoT). The algorithm uses a public ledger (Blockchain) that contains nodes position and the list of their neighbor nodes. This ledger is shared among the IoT devices. Once an IoT device is localized its new position and the list of neighbor nodes are added to the Blockchain. This shared localization data will be used later by other IoT devices for their localization process. To avoid the attack where a malicious node sends a fake position, the correctness of the claimed position are verified before adding it to the Blockchain. Moreover, data exchanged between nodes (IoT devices) are signed to guarantee their authenticity and integrity. The integration of these security mechanisms into the localization process permits to exclude false data and therefore reduces the localization error. The simulation results show that adding the proposed security mechanism improves the localization accuracy of the algorithm when running in the presence of malicious nodes.

AB In the traditional medical system, individual medical data is managed by hospitals rather than individual patients. It is difficult to exchange effectively with fragmented storage, and large amounts of data are difficult to realize their potential value. With the rapid development of medical informatization, centralized storage of fragmented medical data has been unable to meet the relevant needs of the medical industry. To solve the difficulty of sharing and the complexity of confirming rights in the medical system, this paper proposes a medical data sharing model based on blockchain. The model provides reliable storage with IPFS file system, uses Proxy re-encryption to realize data sharing and ensure data proprietary rights, and uses Token economic system to measure the contribution in the sharing process, which stimulates the enthusiasm of sharing. At last, based on the existing sharing problem of medical data, the paper shows the potential solution.

However, because of insufficient supervision, the market attracts scams, for example, pump and dump (P&D) scheme, a famous fraudulent behavior in stock markets, has been found rampant in the market. To help deal with this issue, as a preliminary study, this paper proposes an improved apriori algorithm to detect user groups which may involve in P&D schemes. The validity of the algorithm is verified by using the leaked transaction history of Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange. Furthermore, by exploring some of the detected user groups, many abnormal trading behaviors in the exchange found. These findings provide new insights into the behavior of users in the cryptocurrency market, thus leading to meaningful implications for policymakers, investors, and managers dealing with the cryptocurrency market.

TI Exploiting Blockchain Data to Detect Smart Ponzi Schemes on Ethereum
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology becomes increasingly popular. It also attracts scams, for example, a Ponzi scheme, a classic fraud, has been found making a notable amount of money on Blockchain, which has a very negative impact. To help to deal with this issue and to provide reusable research data sets for future research, this paper collects real-world samples and proposes an approach to detect Ponzi schemes implemented as smart contracts (i.e., smart Ponzi schemes) on the blockchain. First, 200 smart Ponzi schemes are obtained by manually checking more than 3,000 open source smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Then, two kinds of features are extracted from the transaction history and operation codes of the smart contracts. Finally, a classification model is presented to detect smart Ponzi schemes. The extensive experiments show that the proposed model performs better than many traditional classification models and can achieve high accuracy for practical use. By using the proposed approach, we estimate that there are more than 500 smart Ponzi schemes running on Ethereum. Based on these results, we propose to build a uniform platform to evaluate and monitor every created smart contract for early warning of scams.

AB The cryptocurrency market is a very huge market without effective supervision. It is of great importance for investors and regulators to recognize whether there are market manipulation and its manipulation patterns. This paper proposes an approach to mine the transaction networks of exchanges for answering this question. By taking the leaked transaction history of Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange as a sample, we first divide the accounts into three categories according to its characteristic and then construct the transaction history into three graphs. Many observations and findings are obtained via analyzing the constructed graphs. To evaluate the influence of the accounts' transaction behavior on the Bitcoin exchange price, the graphs are reconstructed into series and reshaped as matrices. By using singular value decomposition (SVD) on the matrices, we identify many base networks which have a great correlation with the price fluctuation. When further analyzing the most important accounts in the base networks, plenty of market manipulation patterns are found. According to these findings, we conclude that there was serious market manipulation in Mt. Gox exchange and the cryptocurrency market must strengthen the supervision.

TI IOV Privacy Protection System Based on Double-Layered Chains
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB As the Internet of Vehicle (IOV) being widely applied throughout our daily life, how to secure data privacy of each vehicle is nowadays a hot topic. Taking an aim of solving this problem, a privacy protection system on double-layered chain basis is designed to eliminate the said security risk during vehicle data communication. At the same time, the nontampering nature of the block chain is used to realize reasonable arbitration in traffic accident disputes, vehicle insurance claims, and other states of affairs. Specifically, an IOV double-layered chain model is constructed to simulate a semicentralized system that is convenient for government to supervise; also, a RSA protocol based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is designed to bring safety and zero-knowledge property to the system; finally, we give the application scenario of this IOV privacy protection system based on double-layered chain that it can be widely used in vehicle-sharing industry. The communication costs, respectively, under double-layered chain and single-layered chain frameworks, are compared to prove that the double-layered structure does save cost. Thus an IOV privacy scheme that is safer and more cost-efficient is given.

AB Randomness is a significant ingredient to achieve fairness on many applications (i.e., gambling). On the use of blockchain and smart contract, we observe that some existing lottery and gambling games involve one single source to produce randomness. As known, Fomo3D uses the game state to determine the winner, whereas TrueFlip uses the blockchain state (at a specific point in time). Those system do not rely on significant randomness extraction. In this paper, we present a lottery DApp and implement it by using smart contracts. In this DApp, the randomness is determined not only from game and blockchain states, but also from committees.

TI VOLTimebank: A Volunteer System for Mutual Pension Based on Blockchain

AB With the process of the population aging, the problem of the aged in the urban is becoming increasingly prominent in China, especially the shortage of pension resources. In order to solve this problem, we proposed Volunteer time bank (VOLTimebank) based on blockchain, a novel distributed ledger that allows transactions without any third party organization. VOLTimebank is a record management system to handle volunteer service records. The system provides a channel for volunteers to serve the elderly and gives volunteers a way to exchange the services they can offer today with the services that they hope to get in the future. And a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism is used to select auditors, whose main task is to audit volunteers' services. Each holder of the (volunteer medals (VOLMedals) has the right to vote for auditors and be voted to be an auditor. As a proof of concept, we present a prototype implementation of VOLTimebank via smart contracts based on Ethereum. VOLTimebank is a true realization of "Serve today, enjoy tomorrow", encouraging more people to take part in the volunteer services, for the elderly and for themselves. This paper is intended to illustrate the ideas and methods of VOLTimebank.

AB An enormous amount of energy is wasted in Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanisms adopted by popular blockchain applications (e.g., PoW-based cryptocurrencies) because miners must conduct a large amount of computation. Owing to this, one serious rising concern is that the energy waste not only dilutes the value of the blockchain but also hinders its further application. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain design that fully recycles the energy required for facilitating and maintaining it, which is re-invested to the computation of deep learning. We realize this by proposing Proof-of-Deep-Learning (PoDL) such that a valid proof for a new block can be generated if and only if a proper deep learning model is produced. We present a proof-of-concept design of PoDL that is compatible with the majority of the cryptocurrencies that are based on hash-based PoW mechanisms. Our benchmark and simulation results show that the proposed design is feasible for various popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

AB The Bitcoin protocol and its underlying cryptocurrency have started to shape the way we view digital currency, and opened up a large list of new and interesting challenges. Amongst them, we focus on the question of how is the price of digital currencies affected, which is a natural question especially when considering the price roller-coaster we witnessed for bitcoin in 2017-2018. We work under the hypothesis that price is affected by the web footprint of influential people, we refer to them as crypto-influencers.
   In this paper we provide neural models for predicting bitcoin price. We compare what happens when the model is fed only with recent price history versus what happens when fed, in addition, with a measure of the positivity or negativity of the sayings of these influencers, measured through a sentiment analysis of their twitter posts. We show preliminary evidence that twitter data should indeed help to predict the price of bitcoin, even though the measures we use in this paper have a lot of room for refinement. In particular, we also discuss the challenges of measuring the correct sensation of these posts, and discuss the work that should help improving our discoveries even further.

AB While many distributed consensus protocols provide robust liveness and consistency guarantees under the presence of malicious actors, quantitative estimates of how economic incentives affect security are few and far between. In this paper, we describe a system for simulating how adversarial agents, both economically rational and Byzantine, interact with a blockchain protocol. This system provides statistical estimates for the economic difficulty of an attack and how the presence of certain actors influences protocol-level statistics, such as the expected time to regain liveness. This simulation system is influenced by the design of algorithmic trading and reinforcement learning systems that use explicit modeling of an agent's reward mechanism to evaluate and optimize a fully autonomous agent. We implement and apply this simulation framework to Kadena's Chainweb, a parallelized Proof-of-Work system, that contains complexity in how miner incentive compliance affects security and censorship resistance. We provide the first formal description of Chainweb that is in the literature and use this formal description to motivate our simulation design. Our simulation results include a phase transition in block height growth rate as a function of shard connectivity and empirical evidence that censorship in Chainweb is too costly for rational miners to engage in. We conclude with an outlook on how simulation can guide and optimize protocol development in a variety of contexts, including Proof-of-Stake parameter optimization and peer-to-peer networking design.

AB Blockchains are gaining a substantial recognition as an alternative to the traditional data storage systems due to their tampering-resistant and decentralized storage, independence from any centralized authority, and low entry barriers for new network participants. Presently blockchains allow users to store transactions and data sets, however, they don't provide an easy way of creating and keeping relationships between data entities. In this paper we demonstrate a solution that helps software developers maintain relationships between inter-related data entities and datasets in a blockchain. Our solution runs over Ethereum's Go implementation. This is the first step towards a database management-like middleware system for blockchains.

AB We suggest a general framework for network-coded Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant (PBFT) consensus for enabling agreement among distributed nodes under Byzantine attacks. The suggested protocol generalizes existing replication and sharding schemes which are frequently used for consensus in current blockchain systems. Using the proposed algorithm, it is possible to reach a consensus when the available bandwidth is considerably smaller on individual links compared to that required for conventional schemes. It is shown that there exists an upper bound on the number of nodes that can participate in the protocol, given a maximum bandwidth constraint across all pairwise links. Furthermore, the protocol that achieves the upper bound is provided by using a set of constant weight codes.

TI Compliance of Electronic Bill of Lading Regulation in Korea with Model
   Law on Electronic Transferable Records
SO JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE
AB Purpose -The UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (Model Law) is based on the principles of non-discrimination against the use of electronic means, functional equivalence, and technology neutrality underpinning all UNCITRAL texts on electronic commerce. Investigating the disagreements between the Model Law and the Koran Commercial Act (KC Act), including the B/ L Regulation, and suggesting the revision of the KC Act including the B/ L Regulation, could be a valuable study. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the harmonization of Korean legislation regarding electronic bill of lading in compliance with the Model Law. Design/ methodology -The Model Law is flexible to accommodate the use of all technologies and models, such as registries, tokens, and distributed ledgers: that is, blockchain. In 2007, the KC Act was revised to regulate electronic bills of lading to promote the widespread legal use of electronic bills of lading. In addition, The Regulation on Implementation of the Provisions of the Commercial Act Regarding Electronic Bills of Lading (the B/ L Regulation) was enacted to regulate the detailed procedures in using electronic bills of lading in 2008. This paper employs a legal analysis by which this paper does find differences between two rules in light of technology neutrality and global standard of electronic bills of lading model. Findings -The main findings are as follows: i) the Korean registry agency has characteristics of a closed system. ii) The KC Act has no provision regarding control. iii) The KC Act discriminates other electronic bills of lading on the ground that it was issued or used abroad. Moreover, this study does comprehensive analysis of Korean Acts in comparison with the Model Law and, in particular, this study analyzes the differences between the KC Act and the Model Law by comparing article by article in view of the harmonization of the two rules. Originality/ value -The subject of previous several studies was draft provisions on Electronic Transferable Records before completion of the Model Law; thus, these studies did not take into consideration the character of the Model Law as the Model Law was chosen at the final stage of legislation. This study is aimed at the final version of the Model Law. So, this study is meaningful by finding the suggestion and directions for the Korean government to revise the KC Act and the B/ L Regulation in line with the Model Law.

TI Business on Chain: A Comparative Case Study of Five Blockchain-Inspired
   Business Models
SO JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Blockchain technology, despite its origins as the underlying infrastructure for value transfer in the era of cryptocurrency, has been touted as the main disruptive force in modern businesses. Blockchain has the capacity to chronologically capture and store transactional data in a standardized and tamper-proof format that is transparent to all stakeholders involved in the transaction. This, in turn, has prompted companies to rethink preexisting business practices, thereby yielding a myriad of fascinating business models anchored in blockchain technology. In this study, we advance contemporary knowledge of business applications of blockchain by drawing on the theoretical lens of the digital business model and value configuration to decipher how pioneers in this space are leveraging blockchain to create and capture value. Through a comparative, multiple case study approach, we analyzed five companies in mainland China that have rolled out blockchain initiatives. From our case analyses, we derived a typology of five blockchain-inspired business models, each of which embodies a distinctive logic for market differentiation. For each business model, we offer insights into its value creation logic, its value capturing mechanism, and the challenges that could threaten its longer-term viability. Grounded in our findings, we discuss key implications for theory and practice.

AB We study the foundations of secure computation in the blockchain-hybrid model, where a blockchain - modeled as a global functionality is available as an Oracle to all the participants of a cryptographic protocol. We demonstrate both destructive and constructive applications of blockchains:
   We show that classical rewinding-based simulation techniques used in many security proofs fail against blockchain-active adversaries that have read and post access to a global blockchain. In particular, we show that zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with black-box simulation are impossible against blockchain-active adversaries.
   Nevertheless, we show that achieving security against blockchain-active adversaries is possible if the honest parties are also blockchain active. We construct an omega(1)-round ZK protocol with black-box simulation. We show that this result is tight by proving the impossibility of constant-round ZK with black-box simulation.
   Finally, we demonstrate a novel application of blockchains to overcome the known impossibility results for concurrent secure computation in the plain model. We construct a concurrent self-composable secure computation protocol for general functionalities in the blockchain-hybrid model based on standard cryptographic assumptions.
   We develop a suite of techniques for constructing secure protocols in the blockchain-hybrid model that we hope will find applications to future research in this area.

AB MAAS as a mobility model leans on the idea that a gap between private and public transport systems needs to be bridged as well as on a city, intercity, national and supranational level. The current situation is felt problematic due to the fragmented tools and services often organized in silos to meet a traveler needs to undertake a trip. One of the major concerns designing any platform system like Mobility as a Service is where to start modeling and how to express the notion of the platform system in some language that is understandable for all stakeholders of the platform system. Understandability buttresses the expectation of stakeholders whether some design will probably implement the intended platform services enabling users to actually buy and or use the platform system for what ever purpose. Building on the economic theories of two-sided markets and mechanism design we introduce the concept of value nets extending the Contract Protocol Net. Value net modeling offers a precise abstract representation which provides in the detailed informational requirements in a canonical form and it connects i.e. implements the abstract notion of Service Oriented Architecture characterizing systems without loss of crucial informational elements.

TI RandomBlocks: A Transparent, Verifiable Blockchain-based System for

SO JOURNAL OF CELLULAR AUTOMATA
AB Games-of-chance require high-levels of trust between participants that is often uncertain and difficult to enforce. The unique characteristics introduced by the blockchain technology can be leveraged to inform a verifiable but transparent pseudo-random generation process that at the same time eliminates the need of an external trustee service or oracle to guarantee the fair execution of the process. We propose a process that builds on a one-dimensional Cellular Automaton (CA) where the evolution of the CA aligns to the evolution of a blockchain. Given an initial seed defined as the point in time where the evolution of the CA is triggered, the set of transition rules, along with the finite number of evolution steps, any external oracle is able to verify and backtrack (but not predict) the outcome of the process. The effectiveness of the implemented system is confirmed by the use of various statistical testing suites that confirm the existence of a set of statistical properties required to produce sufficient pseudo-random number sequences.

AB The EPCglobal Network is a computer network used to share product data between trading partners. The EPC Information Services (EPCIS) is an event record repository that allows disparate applications to access and query for data both within and across enterprises. Ultimately, this data sharing is aimed at enabling participants in the EPCglobal Network to gain a shared view of the disposition of EPC-bearing objects within a relevant business context [1].
   Despite the potential benefits, enterprises are reluctant to integrate into the EPCglobal Network due to the financial and manpower resources required to set up, operate and maintain the EPCIS and to adopt the standards. Issues like security, computation and storage overheads would also have to be managed. To solve the problem, this paper advocates a blockchain solution using Hyperledger Fabric to serve as a shared EPCIS across trading partners. The blockchain can be queried directly to facilitate information sharing subjected to access control rules. It also adheres to the EPCglobal Network standards. This approach provides several important benefits including eliminating the need for enterprises to maintain their own EPCIS while still being able to participate and benefit from the network. As the blockchain can be queried directly, the provision of EPC Discovery Services (EPCDS) may also be unnecessary. To explore this idea, we constructed a prototype using Hyperledger Composer and Hyperledger Fabric while adhering to the data elements, structures and formats as stated in the standards to ensure interoperability with existing architecture both upstream and downstream.

TI Hubs, Rebalancing and Service Providers in the Lightning Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Payment channel networks are the most developed proposal to address the well-known issue of blockchain scalability. Currently, the Lightning Network (LN) is the mainstream and most used payment channel network. In a previous work we introduced CLoTH, a payment channel network simulator we developed to analyze capabilities and limitations of such networks. In this work, using CLoTH, we present results of three groups of simulations on a recent snapshot of the LN, aimed to shed a light on the following aspects. Firstly, we investigated how hubs influence the LN performance. Then, we analyzed the effectiveness of two different channel rebalancing approaches, an active and a passive one. Eventually, we studied performance of the LN when a few service-providers nodes receive payments from the other network nodes, which is a typical use case of payment channel networks. We found that the LN is resilient to the removal of hubs, that our passive rebalancing approach reduces of about one fourth the payments failures due to channel unbalancing, and that in the service-providers scenario a consistent part of payments fails because channels directing to the service providers become unbalanced. Our work contributes to prove the strengthen of the Lightning Network when removing hubs and its weakness in the service-provider scenario. In addition, the passive rebalancing approach proposed in this work is a good candidate for the implementation in the Lightning Network protocol to mitigate channel unbalancing.

AB We propose TickEth, a system that aims at mitigating some of the problems encountered by the ticketing industry. The name TickEth is built by combining the words ticket, its application domain, and Ethereum, the underlying platform we adopted for the development of the prototype.
   Nowadays, ticketing ecosystem is wide and fragmented, and faces several problems. TickEth exploits Ethereum smart contracts to tackle the inability of checking the authenticity of tickets sold online (that can be fake or duplicates of a real ticket), the wild price range of resold tickets in the secondary market, and the unwieldy refund procedures.
   TickEth is an open specification, where different third-party clients can freely interact, and can be instantiated by different vendors as they like. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype, available at: https://github.com/H221/TickEth

SO DISRUPTING FINANCE: FINTECH AND STRATEGY IN THE 21ST CENTURY
SE Palgrave Studies in Digital Business & Enabling Technologies
AB Traditional challenges insurers face include: (1) asymmetric information-the inability to price a policyholder correctly; (2) moral hazards-the change of attitude following cover; and (3) claims management. In this chapter, we discuss how disruptive technologies are evolving in the insurance sector and the challenges faced in their implementation. We show how large and continuous datasets are transforming the general insurance markets and their business processes, as well as enticing desirable policyholder behaviour and streamlining claims management. We then discuss how artificial intelligence is improving traditional insurance processes from the first point of contact to claims management. We also examine the use of artificial intelligence as a means of interacting with prospective clients and existing policyholders. Finally, we explain how blockchain technology can transform the structure of the insurance market to a peer-to-peer format.

AB Caching and sharing contents among mobile devices via wireless device-to-device (D2D) communications is a promising way to offload data traffic. In order to encourage more content sharing among mobile devices, we propose a blockchain incentive scheme in this paper, where the base station (BS) can allocate computing power to mine blockchain in a period of time and give this mining profit to the mobile devices that share contents with others via D2D communication. In order to maximize the total profit, we develop the caching placement schemes considering different relationships between the allocated computing power and the shared data size. For the linear relationship, we can obtain the closed form expression of the optimal caching scheme and find that the mobile device prefers to cache the popular contents. For the nonlinear relationship, the optimal problem can be effectively solved by difference of convex (DC) programming and the results reveal that the mobile device prefers to caching different contents.

TI Mediatized Rituals: Understanding the Media in the Age of Deep
   Mediatization
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB In this article, I propose the concept of mediatized ritual as a conceptual update to media events and media rituals. With this concept, I intend to better address the ritualistic orientation that privileges an increasingly mediatized social reality constructed through algorithmic collection, processing, and (re)presentation of data and metadata by communication technologies. I argue that to understand mediatized ritual, the media must be understood not as genres or media institutions, but as (1) the technological affordance and human practices of networked access to information and (2) the social perception of tamper-resistance of information, which construct the social reality in a mediatized manner. Blockchain technology and its social nature are analyzed as an example of the utility of the concept. The sociological implications regarding rituals, trust, normalcy, and power-relationship are also discussed.

AB Contemporary software deployments rely on cloud-based package managers for installation, where existing packages are installed on demand from remote code repositories. Usually frameworks or common utilities, packages increase the code reusability within the ecosystem, whilst keeping the code base small. However, disruptions in the package management services can potentially affect development and deployment workflows. Furthermore, cloud package managers have arguably an ambiguous ownership model and offer limited visibility of packages to the users. This work describes the development of a blockchain-based package control system which is decentralised, reliable, and transparent. Blockchain nodes are installed within the distributed infrastructure to provide immutability, and then a dependency graph is constructed with the help of smart contracts to trace the software provenance. Our system has been successfully tested with 4338 packages from NPM, 950 out of which are the top depended-upon packages.

Utilizing the blockchain-enabled IoT technology in the power trading of the network MGs can potentially lead to some significant advantages such as fewer system risks, mitigate financial fraud, and less the operational cost. A newly stochastic framework based on the unscented transform (UT) is employed to model the uncertainties of renewable energy resources and hourly load demand. Consequently, the proposed framework is tested on the network MG containing residential MG (as a non-crucial load), commercial MG (as an intermediate level load), and hospital MG (as a crucial load), to validate the effectiveness and high performance of the proposed technique.

AB The blockchain technology is more and more important in computer security. The core of the blockchain system is consensus. However, many consensus mechanisms reward those groups that own the majority of the resources. In addition, the performance of these consensus mechanisms is poor. In this paper we first present Proof of Value (POV), an incentive mechanism that rewards the value creators. With the help of POV, we reward the user who creates value and control the number of coins through the incentive coefficient adjustment algorithm. To improve the performance of POV in permissioned blockchain, we designed Hypernet, an off-chain transaction system. By designing the transaction system Hypernet, the transaction can be handled without blockchain. Finally, we evaluate our system by generating random parameters to invoke the contract. Then we record the real time for issuing the rewards. The test results show that the loss of the system is about 2% when the POV is added. The performance of the Hypernet is four times higher than the traditional permissioned blockchain transaction system.

AB Wi-Fi is widely used as an inexpensive way for terminal service access, which brings a trend of Wi-Fi sharing. However, the current Wi-Fi sharing mode has problems such as low reliability and high cost. In order to cope with these problems, this paper puts forward a decentralizedWi-Fi sharing mechanism based on blockchain, including three sub-mechanisms of Wi-Fi authentication, Wi-Fi sharing, and Wi-Fi usage charging. Specifically, Wi-Fi owners first authenticate their Wi-Fi information on the blockchain and only the authenticated Wi-Fi can be connected. Then, the Wi-Fi users pay for the Wi-Fi usage through the smart contracts. Finally, all transactions are registered on the blockchain to ensure the security and reliability of Wi-Fi sharing process. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism keeps a high Wi-Fi sharing success rate of more than 97 percent at a high Wi-Fi request rate of 200 tps.

AB Recently, there has been increasing interest in employing blockchain in different applications, other than crypto-currencies. Blockchains allow a peer to peer distributed network where different nodes communicate with each other, in a trustless manner. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is an Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables long range communication. Although LoRaWAN networks are secure, the LoRaWAN join procedure is susceptible to replay and jamming attacks. Moreover, trust between network server and LoRa end device is the basic foundation of LoRaWAN network however, the centralized nature of network servers raise trust issues between network operators and customers. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight two factor authentication mechanism for LoRaWAN join procedure, based on blockchain technology. The proposed blockchain based framework provides an extra layer of security for LoRaWAN join procedure and build trust among LoRaWAN network components. The proposed framework is validated using the Ethereum blockchain. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides efficient system performance in terms of throughput and latency. The proposed blockchain architecture is a cost effective solution, which can be utilized in the LoRaWAN network with few network servers and LoRa end device, having no strict requirement of throughput and latency.

AB Vendor-managed inventory (VMI) is a widely used collaborative inventory management policy in which manufacturers/vendors manage the inventory of retailers and take responsibility for making decisions related to the timing and extent of inventory replenishment. There exist several prerequisites for a successful VMI strategy implementation like information sharing, trust, systems integration and long-term collaboration. However, in nowadays logistics flows, complex processes, high number of participants and complex distribution channels impede the successful adoption of VMI strategies. In this paper, we propose a new interaction framework based on smart contracts and blockchain for governing the relationship between the vendor and the buyer. A use-case VMI scenario is presented along with a functional smart contract. Tests performed using a local private blockchain illustrate the applicability of the proposed architecture along with the significant benefits for each participant.

TI The Qualification of Bitcoins as Documentary Intangibles
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB It is unclear how bitcoins should be qualified from a legal perspective. This qualification is, among other things, relevant to determine how bit(x)ins should be transferred, pledged, attached and executed. In this article, bitcoins and bitcoin transfers are explained from a technical perspective and subsequently qualified from a contract and property law perspective. Given the borderless nature of bitcoins and its underlying bitcoin technology, these subjects are dealt with in an international manner, often drawing upon legal concepts which form the backbone of most if not all legal systems, especially those in the EU. In this article, the following conclusions are reached. First of all, from a contract law perspective, the bitcoin network qualifies as a multi-party contract to which the various participants (users, miners and nodes) accede by participating in the network for the first time and, in doing so, accept the third-party rights clause stipulated in that agreement in their favour. Secondly, from a property law perspective, the rights with respect to the bitcoins credited to a bitcoin address are put to bearer at the same moment these bitcoins are so credited. They are put to the bearer of the value bearer on which the private key associated with that bitcoin address is stored. That value bearer embodies the right of that bearer to perform the work necessary to transfer the bitcoins on that bitcoin address, more specifically vis-a-vis the miners to validate that transaction and vis-a-vis the nodes to verify the work of the winning miner. Those bitcoin rights can be transferred, pledged, attached and executed by possession of the value bearer.

AB Electronic medical records (EMRs) are highly sensitive information shared among peers to keep up-to-date patient history. Providing security, privacy, and availability to these sensitive data is a challenge because, typically, after data publication the patient loses control over them. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based approach to secure EMR for healthcare applications, where access control is patient-centric. Our proposal keeps encrypted EMRs in the blockchain, and the patient shares the decryption key only with healthcare professionals in which he/she trusts. Blockchain allows untrusted node, in a distributed peer-to-peer network to correctly and verifiably interact with each other, without any reliable intermediary. We investigate the scalability of our approach through simulations. Results show that it scales well since increasing the number of nodes in the network implies a linear increase in the size of the stored chain. Results also reveal that the time for inserting a new EMR in the blockchain remains low even when the number of nodes in the network increases.

AB Despite common arguments about the prevalence of blockchain technology, in terms of security, privacy, and immutability, in reality, several attacks can be launched against them. This paper provides a systematic literature review on long-range attacks for proof of stake protocols. If successful, these attacks may take over the main chain and partially, or even completely, rewrite the history of transactions that are stored in the blockchain. To this end, we describe how proof of stake protocols work, their fundamental properties, their drawbacks, and their attack surface. After presenting long-range attacks, we discuss possible countermeasures and their applicability.

AB The automotive industry is re-blooming with recent enhances in technology. Electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles are already attracting attention to the industry and providing momentum for adoption of other emerging technologies. This has its impact on a diverse range of stakeholders from manufacturers to consumers.
   There is a new frontier that can lend its abilities to the experiences built around vehicles and it is the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is an enabler. It can act as a transaction medium between interacting parties. It can also be used as a tamper-free ledger to store a history of transactions. With these two simple abilities, blockchains can enable several applications to make vehicle-related experiences better.
   In this paper, we propose a tamper-free ledger of events as an insurance record of motor vehicles. This insurance record system can include all aspects of insurance transactions. It not only would improve the experience around proving insurance, but also act as evidence in the event of a dispute. This ledger can have extended services around providing a clean driving record. Individual drivers, dealers, insurance companies, lawyers, law enforcement agencies and motor vehicle agencies are all stakeholders of this blockchain based solution.

AB Cyber-physical systems rely more and more on wireless technologies that operate in unmanaged, unlicensed frequency hands. Already today, this leads to security issues and a significant degradation of network performance due to interference and traffic congestion. Only collaboration between stakeholders leads to a sustainable solution. To facilitate collaboration, we designed a platform that heavily relies on the concept of Software-Defined Networking, introducing a central controller for programmable radio parameters. Part of this solution is a Brokering Platform that automates negotiation for spectral resources between access point (AP) operators. In this article we present a novel architecture for a Brokering Platform. We also propose secure distribution of Brokering Platform functionality over the APs using blockchain.

TI Blockchain-Based Trusted Electronic Records Preservation in Cloud
   Storage
SO CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
AB Cloud storage represents the trend of intensive, scale and specialization of information technology, which has changed the technical architecture and implementation method of electronic records management. Moreover, it will provide a convenient way to generate more advanced and efficient management of the electronic data records. However, in cloud storage environment, it is difficult to guarantee the trustworthiness of electronic records, which results in a series of severe challenges to electronic records management. Starting from the definition and specification of electronic records, this paper firstly analyzes the requirements of the trustworthiness in cloud storage during their long-term preservation according to the information security theory and subdivides the trustworthiness into the authenticity, integrity, usability, and reliability of electronic records in cloud storage. Moreover, this paper proposes the technology framework of preservation for trusted electronic records. Also, the technology of blockchain, proofs of retrievability, the open archival information system model and erasure code are adopted to protect these four security attributes, to guarantee the credibility of the electronic record.

TI Forecasting cryptocurrency markets through the use of time series models
SO BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC HORIZONS
AB This paper analyses the efficiency of cryptocurrency markets by applying econometric models to different short-term investment horizons. A number of experiments are carried out to demonstrate that small training sets can still be used to build efficient and useful forecasts, which in turn can be transformed into straightforward investment strategies. It also compares the application of selected models on cryptocurrency and mature stock markets. The forecasting accuracy of the models is explored using different error metrics and different horizons. The results suggest that the variation of the error estimates doesn't appear to be tightly related to the maturity of the markets, but rather depends on the intrinsic characteristics of the analyzed time series.

AB Permissionless blockchain-enabled smart contracts execute code in a distributed peer-to-peer network system and thereby overcome undesirable effects of system centralization. Smart contracts that use proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithms for the validation of transactions have advantages over proof-of work (PoW) in that they use less electricity and perform faster. The disadvantage of PoS algorithms is the issue of nothing to stake and the emergence of staking oligopolies. Thus, significant stakeholders might be able to create an oligopoly as miners with significant stakes have the chance to validate the transaction in a dominant position. In current smart contracts, the adoption of mobile devices is another emerging trend to manage mobile smart contracts. The advantage is spreading of a democratization effect as a large number of stakers participate in transaction validation and thereby reduce the risk of oligopolies. In our work, we aim to improve the PoS algorithm to reduce oligopoly formation in smart contracts by addressing the need for creating mobile smart contracts that are governed by a mobile lifecycle management. Additionally, we enhance the scalability and performance of smart contracts by focusing specifically on ways to incentivize PoS algorithms.

AB In this era of rapid growth of vehicles, the ratio of road accident increases day by day. Nowadays, Traffic incidents are persistent problems in both developed and developing countries which result in huge loss of life and property. No one in this world is ready to gaze what's happening around them. Nobody cares even when an accident occurs. This paper provides an innovative solution by developing an Accident Alert Message System using an Android Smartphone Application that can be used from the accident zone. The application uses GPS technology for location mapping and sends an alert and notification of an accident. The generated accident alert message is endorsed by the nearby registered users who also witness the accident to ensure the increased reputation of the message. Based on the endorsement of the message, the system will instantly transmit the location of the accident to the nearby emergency services. In this case, users usually lack the enthusiasm to generate or endorse alert messages because they might fear that their privacy will be breached. At the same time, users do not benefit from generating or endorsing alert messages which also makes them lack the enthusiasm or motivation to respond to messages. In order to provide a solution to resolve these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-preserving Blockchain Based Incentive Mechanism for Accident Alert Message System. The main objective of the paper is to encourage the users to generate and endorse accident alert messages from the accident zone without revealing the user's identity. Also, some incentives to the users are paid to the message generators and endorsers and the transactions get stored based on the Blockchain technology; hence the privacy of the user is preserved. Our proposed system ensures the reliability of alert messages without revealing the privacy of the user and is reliable and efficient in the non-fully-trusted environment.

AB The Internet of Things is evolving as a complete matured technology to be used in all the Smart applications and it establishes itself in the future generations of internet. As like Internet of Things, Blockchain is the blooming technology in which each node involved in the blockchain contains the distributed ledger which enhances the security and data transparency. Illegal users are not able to perform any fault transaction in the blockchain network due to its ability of performing smart contract and consensus. The Internet of Things can be merged with the blockchain to improve the performance of the application in real time. However, managing the devices connected to the sensors in IoT environment and mining the block chain remains the technical challenge forever. With this background, we make an attempt to survey the core details of blockchain technology and its features. In this paper, we have proposed design architecture by merging IoT and BlockChain for Smart Agriculture and ended up with some new architectural framework.

AB Ethereum is still the most prominent platform for smart contracts. For the deployment of contracts on its blockchain, the so-called deployment code is executed by Ethereum's virtual machine. As it turns out, deployment code can do a lot more than merely deploying a contract.
   This paper identifies less-anticipated uses of contract deployment in Ethereum by analyzing the available blockchain data. In particular, we analyze the specifics of deployment code used beyond actually deploying a contract in a quantitative and qualitative manner. To this end, we identify code patterns in deployment code by distilling recurring code skeletons from all external transactions and internal messages that contain deployment code. Tracking the use of these patterns reveals a set of vulnerabilities in contracts targeted by skillfully crafted deployment code. We summarize the encountered exploitative cases of collateral use of deployment code and report respective quantities. Example scenarios illustrate the recent usage.
   Collateral use of deployment code starts to appear in the middle of 2018 and becomes dominant among contract creations in autumn of 2018. We intend to raise awareness about the less obvious uses of deployment code and its potential security issues.

AB Explicit legal regulation is still lacking in many countries for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, and others. This is not unusual for a new technology. On top of such cryptocurrencies, another new technology, so-called smart contracts, has been established. Smart contracts are specialized computer code with the aim to automate the exchange of (digital) assets. In decentralized applications (Dapps), parts of the business logic and the data storage of traditional web applications are replaced with smart contracts. They are credited with considerable potential for commercial use, especially in FinTech but also beyond. Smart contracts mostly lack explicit legal regulation as well. Hitherto there is little experience in applying current law to them. Building a business on uncertain terrain is at least risky. We seek a clarification of smart contracts in the legal context, especially against the background of the Civil Code.

AB A key issue for Distributed Ledger Technologies is how to agree on any changes to the Ledger; the way to reach such an agreement is known as consensus protocol. There are currently many platforms and implementations of DLTs, each offering a more or less effective way to reach consensus. As a result, it is sometimes difficult to know which consensus mechanism is most appropriate for a given use case. We propose in this short paper a draft methodology to choose between a lottery-based consensus and a voting-based consensus. We take in account several indicators, both related to the requirements of the use case in question, but also to its position relatively to the tradeoff "Security - Scalability - Decentralization".

TI Transaction Fees, Block Size Limit, and Auctions in Bitcoin
SO LEDGER
AB Confirmation of Bitcoin transactions is executed in blocks, which are then stored in the Blockchain. As compared to the number of transactions in the mempool, the set of transactions which are verified but not yet confirmed, available space for inclusion in a block is typically limited. For this reason, successful miners can only process a subset of such transactions, and users compete with each other to enter the next block by offering confirmation fees. Assuming that successful miners pursue revenue maximization, they will include in the block those mempool transactions that maximize earnings from related fees. In the paper we model transaction fees as a Nash Equilibrium outcome of an auction game with complete information. In the game the successful miner acts as an auctioneer selling block space, and users bid for shares of such space to confirm their transactions. Moreover, based on expected fees we also discuss what the optimal, revenue maximizing, block size limit should be for the successful miner. Consistently with the intuition, the optimal block size limit resolves the trade-off between including additional transactions (which possibly lower the unit fees collected) and keeping the block capacity limited (with, however, higher unit fees).

AB Global supply chains represent the backbone of the modern manufacturing industry. Planning of global supply chains still represents a major hurdle, mainly because of the high complexity and unforeseen disruptions that have to be mastered for meeting the different logistics windows in a globally distributed production environment. Trust in supply chains is an additional challenge. A major - albeit sometimes overlooked - part of Supply Chain Management (SCM) is the management and integration of customs processes, clearing of tariffs, (re-)billing of customers, and fulfilling other legal requirements related to crossing borders, ranging from environmental standards over goods inspection to general paper work. With the exception of work offered by the World Customs Organization (WCO) the issue of customs and blockchain is still underrepresented in research and practice. In this paper, we look at innovations that drive the current ICT-enabled SCM research and how these can be combined with smart customs management. After a literature review and introduction to the state-of-the-art, we list potential trust-based innovations for SCM and customs in digital business ecosystems. Based upon the innovations we also describe a requirements analysis of existing distributed ledger technologies (requirements for system layout, system configuration, system governance). A description of the prototype for the Lake Constance region - on which we are currently working - concludes the paper.

AB Blockchain startups are basing their business models on disrupting the centralized way of data storage by highlighting the value of data to the public. A distributed approach to storing data is the safer way to prevent attacks is what is being evangelized. GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) have monopolized data, therefore bringing in the most revenue whilst depriving the data generators of any form of compensation. In our work, we propose a platform where a user can store his/her own personal data. Here, we present to the user the right to decide what happens to their data. These decisions include selling, renting, and deleting data. The deletion of data undermines the fundamentals the blockchain is built on (data immutability). We address the issues of personal data sharing and how a user's right to delete his/her data can be enforced in a blockchain based network such as ours.

AB The article considers the prospecting opportunities of using block-chain technology in the system of labor relations from the point of economics. The Transaction Cost Economics has been adopted as a conceptual basis for the argumentation since it deals with the category of "transaction costs" as a mandatory attribute of any economic relations with the exception of ideal socialist relations, where these are minimal. The objective of the article is as follows: based on the use of Transaction Cost Economics assumptions, to show the possibilities and prospects for using the blockchain in the system of labor relations as a transaction chain, which eliminates fraud, theft, breach of the rights, opportunism, i.e. minimizes transaction costs. In addition, the article researches into the need of updating the classical ideas introduced by Oliver E. Williamson on classes of regulatory structures that guarantee execution of labor relations due to the fact that the wide-scope blockchain implementation could prospectively reduce transaction costs so that these can be accompanied by a new form of regulatory structures, which the author proposes to refer to as a "smart contract". The authors describe the justifications and examples of possible directions for the blockchain technology use to formalize specific aspects of labor relations subject to reduction in transaction costs. The article considers the possibilities, prospects, and grounds lacking in the possibilities of using blockchain technology in the labor relations system.

TI A Self-Controllable and Balanced Data Sharing Model
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The widespread acceptance of data sharing has promoted the relevant research in both academia and industry. "Data sharing'' is the process of interchanging data among multiple data sources in a controllable access manner. Any such system provides common functionality of storage and access; however, there are prominent differences in non-functionalities, such as self-control, transparency, cost-effectiveness, incentive, and auditing, which make data sharing in a dilemma. In this paper, we propose a distributed data sharing model based on blockchain technology: data owner publishes data with an additional control policy; data consumer inquires data with an access request; and consensus nodes evaluate the request and make decisions. After formalizing the system model, we discuss the procedure of data sharing, reputation management, and proposed solution. With the access control policy, price compensation, and reputation management mechanism, we achieve self-control and price balance in sharing data. Our model is equally a closed-loop control system that acts as a regulator of supervising its participants. The analyses and experimental results show, comparing with the existing sharing systems, that our model is practical and can spur agents to participate actively in sharing data.

AB Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have gained increasing adoption in recent years, and many hope that they may usher in a new era of decentralized electronic money. Unfortunately, they perform the core functions of money quite poorly due to their extremely volatile market value. On the other hand, blockchain "stablecoins" aiming to reduce this volatility, usually through a peg to an external currency like the US dollar, tend to greatly sacrifice decentralization of the money supply that make cryptocurrencies so attractive in the first place.
   Elasticoin is a novel currency issuance algorithm which greatly reduces price volatility by using the cryptographic puzzle of proofs of sequential work to fix the cost of minting a coin to sequential computation time. This causes coin supply to be highly elastic, quickly responding to demand for new coins and greatly dampening price swings. We argue that Elasticoin's fixed-minting-cost approach to low volatility has significant advantages over using pegs or explicit measurement of demand to adjust supply.

AB Internet of Things is the one based on data analytics and the competence to gain an accurate and deep understanding about the sensors. Security is the most crucial and vital need for developing IoT Communication wireless network. Classical Cryptography has provide a way to ensure the fundamental needs of communication networks but the security is not to the optimal level and the downside may be dealt by Quantum technology. To constrain these insights, IoT applications depend on neural networks and machine learning to extract Knowledge data based decision support. The DORBRI architecture proposed in this paper addresses the issues that are faced by the cryptosystem through the Post-Quantum cryptography based Quantum IoT. The block chain allows us to ensure the soundness and permanence of the information since you cannot modify or capture data without that particular action get recorded. Communication over the proposed secure channel will be faster and considerably reduce the loss of data.

AB Blockchain is increasingly being used as a distributed, anonymous, trustless framework for energy trading in smart grids. However, most of the existing solutions suffer from reliance on Trusted Third Parties (TTP) and processing overheads. In our previous work, we have proposed a Secure Private Blockchain-based framework (SPB) for energy trading to address the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we present a proof-on-concept implementation of SPB on the Ethereum private network to demonstrates SPB's applicability for energy trading. We benchmark SPB's performance against the relevant state-of-the-art. The implementation results demonstrate that SPB incurs lower overheads and monetary cost for end users to trade energy compared to existing solutions.

AB The ever-growing world of the Internet of Things (IoT) is yet to agree on an effective and practical access control solution. To overcome challenges such as limited resources, or unreliable connectivity, a number of schemes offload heavy computations onto a central entity, thus creating a single point of failure. Our contribution consists in the construction of a distributed attribute-based access control mechanism, relying on the blockchain technology to dynamically manage multi-endorsed attributes and trust anchors. The originality of our proposal is multifold. First, it enables the integration of multiple security domains into a single resilient access control system. Second, its focus on attributes offers flexibility, expressiveness, and user-centricity, accommodating the dynamic addition of subjects. Third, our attribute endorsement is open, scalable, and flexible, enabling multiple administrators without sacrificing ease of management. Finally, the final access control decision is taken by the device and only requires local connection to its gateway.

TI THE INFLUENCE OF FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS ON EU COUNTRIES BANKING SYSTEMS
   DEVELOPMENT
SO MARKETING AND MANAGEMENT OF INNOVATIONS
AB This article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments in the framework of the scientific discussion on determining priority directions of developing banking systems, modern problems and prospects of introduction of financial innovations in the process of development of banking services. Its pace and current trends require a completely scientific basis. Accordingly, the purpose of the study is to determine the impact of modern information technology in the banking systems of the European Union countries and the future prospects for their development. For this purpose, the hypothesis was, first of all, proposed that the level of business activity of the banking activity is related to the level of development of the country's economy and it will determine in the future the development of the banking systems of these countries. An appropriate empirical study was conducted to confirm this hypothesis. The systematization of literary sources and approaches to the solution of this problem has shown that in scientific sources the analysis of the impact of financial innovations on the banking systems of individual European Union countries is mainly carried out. Taking into account the different levels of development of these countries, these studies do not allow us to make conclusions and suggestions as to the future of European banks. Electronic banking, the creation of a large number of fi tech companies, crypto volume, blockade - radically change the classical banking business. These changes are gaining momentum and the future of the banking system is now very ambiguous. Will classical banks be able to function effectively, or will new financial companies come to their place? What should I do to manage the bank to lay the groundwork for its successful operation, in the context of the rapid development of information technology? Who and how will regulate global financial markets? There are no clear answers to these questions. The methodical toolkit of the study was a clustering method, methods of systematization, grouping, comparison, expert evaluations. The study period covers 2015-2018, which shows the most rapid dynamics of changes in the processes of customer service of banks from the offline to the online sphere. In addition, this period of time is characterized by the rapid development of financial innovation, which radically changes the approaches to traditional banking activities.
   The article presents the results of cluster analysis, the results of which allowed to group the countries of the European Union at different levels of digitalization. As a result, it was found that the most advanced economies and the most developed countries have the highest level of deductibility of banking activity (related to clusters 2 and 1). As a higher level of economic development provides more opportunities for investment, Internet access and better education of the population. In addition, it can be argued that it is the countries from the first group in the near future will or will become leaders in the European market of banking services, and it is on them that they will need to be guided by the orientation of the development of the banking system. The results of empirical analysis, have shown that banking institutions understand the lack of prospects of activities without financial innovation. On the other hand, as the study showed, such activity is characterized by high-risk banks. The issue of safety of up-to-date financial transactions is extremely important for supervisors who can not at the moment agree on what measures to apply and implement in order to minimize the risks of financial transactions. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that it is important to understand and justify the basic principles of the future development of banks, to identify and develop measures to minimize the levels of financial risks associated with the implementation of financial innovations, as well as to simply understand and evaluate changes expected by users of banking services during the next 5 to 10 years. The results of the research can be useful for scientists, management of banking and other financial institutions, as well as for users of banking services.

AB Crowdsensing, driven by the proliferation of sensorrich mobile devices, has emerged as a promising data sensing and aggregation paradigm. Despite useful, traditional crowdsensing systems typically rely on a centralized third-party platform for data collection and processing, which leads to concerns like single point of failure and lack of operation transparency. Such centralization hinders the wide adoption of crowdsensing by wary participants. We therefore explore an alternative design space of building crowdsensing systems atop the emerging decentralized blockchain technology. While enjoying the benefits brought by the public blockchain, we endeavor to achieve a consolidated set of desirable security properties with a proper choreography of latest techniques and our customized designs. We allow data providers to safely contribute data to the transparent blockchain with the confidentiality guarantee on individual data and differential privacy on the aggregation result. Meanwhile, we ensure the service correctness of data aggregation and sanitization by delicately employing hardware-assisted transparent enclave. Furthermore, we maintain the robustness of our system against faulty data providers that submit invalid data, with a customized zero-knowledge range proof scheme. The experiment results demonstrate the high efficiency of our designs on both mobile client and SGX-enabled server, as well as reasonable on-chain monetary cost of running our task contract on Ethereum.

AB The Internet of Thing (IoT) is generating an unprecedented volume of data, facilitating the rise of the Data Economy. Under this ecosystem, the IoT data marketplace (IDM) provides an online platform for IoT data trading. Most current IDM solutions are centralized, serving as an intermediary between the data provider and consumer. They support selling and buying data collections (e.g. pre-collected data sets and data streams). However, as these data collections are historically collected without having any priory requirements and preferences given by the data consumer, it is very likely that most of these data collections cannot fulfill data consumer requirements. Redundancy, poor data quality, inaccuracy and limited financial incentives are common problems for existing IDMs, thereby making them financially ineffective. Due to the temporal nature of IoT data, the issue of pre-collection becomes even more critical as it is not trivial to re-collect data from the past.
   This paper presents a novel framework with a new on-demand market model, namely Decentralized IoT Collectability Data Marketplace (DCDM) model. Difference from the conventional IDM models where merely data collections are considered as a commodity, our model also involves operational factors such as data provider availability, operationality, contextual and geographical location etc. This empowers our framework to trade not only the dataset but rather an ability of the data provider to fulfill the collection task. Our game-changing approach is realized using a combination of Blockchain and Crowdsensing techniques. We first explore the concept of "Data Collectability" for IDM, then build a model to deploy our approach on IoT context. Furthermore, we identify potential applications and open research challenges.

We describe MProve, a proof of reserves protocol for Monero exchanges which can be combined with a known proof of liabilities protocol to provide a proof of solvency. It is the first protocol for Monero which provides address privacy by allowing an exchange to hide its own addresses within a larger anonymity set.

AB Smart contracts are self-executing agreements written in program code and are envisioned to be one of the main applications of blockchain technology. While they are supported by prominent cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, their further adoption is hindered by fundamental scalability challenges. For instance, in Ethereum contract execution suffers from a latency of more than 15 s, and the total number of contracts that can be executed per second is very limited. State channel networks are one of the core primitives aiming to address these challenges. They form a second layer over the slow and expensive blockchain, thereby enabling instantaneous contract processing at negligible costs.
   In this work we present the first complete description of a state channel network that exhibits the following key features. First, it supports virtual multi-party state channels, i.e. state channels that can be created and closed without blockchain interaction and that allow contracts with any number of parties. Second, the worst case time complexity of our protocol is constant for arbitrary complex channels. This is in contrast to the existing virtual state channel construction that has worst case time complexity linear in the number of involved parties. In addition to our new construction, we provide a comprehensive model for the modular design and security analysis of our construction.

AB In modern conditions, the significant growth rate is based on the digital economy development and technological leadership. In order to increase human, intellectual and technological advantages in the digital economy, it is necessary to act in areas of systemic importance. The digital economy is the sale of goods and services based on digital electronic technologies. This is the economy of services where the seller or service provider and the consumer practically do not meet in person. Most transactions are made via the Internet.
   The digital currency is just a variation, a derivative tool, one of the types of blockchain system - the technology of decentralized data storage, the chain of transaction blocks, built according to certain rules and providing absolute protection against changes. One of the integral infrastructural elements of the digital economy is electronic money, which appeared as the result of the long evolution of different money types.
   Currently, fiat money is keeping the leading position in the sphere of financial processes implementation. It is struggling to satisfy the needs of the owners. However, it is obvious that traditional paper currency is no longer able to cope with its tasks next to the growing economy in the virtual world. Thus, only digital means are able to completely replace them.

AB Traceability is an increasingly important aspect of the supply chain with several highlights throughout the last few decades. Parties, such as consumers and government agencies, have shown an increase in demand for information regarding their products and materials. Although there exist numerous frameworks for traceability solutions, these frameworks fail to address the concerns with regards to privacy-sensitive information, certificate verifiability, and auditability.
   Our contribution is in two-fold: a traceability system decouples and the product-auditable pasta protocol. decouples is the first decentralized, unlinkable and privacy-preserving traceability system for the supply chain, to the best of our knowledge. The system incorporates cryptographic techniques to address the aforementioned concerns. Our second contribution is the pasta protocol, which allows unique tracking keys per product, per actor. The protocol also anonymizes the receiver of a transaction. Our complexity analysis and proof-of-concept implementation results show that decouples is a feasible traceability system for the supply chain.

AB This paper presents a qualitative study of the recent integration of a UK-based, digital-first mobile banking app Monzo - with the web automation service IFTTT (If This Then That). Through analysis of 113 unique IFTTT 'recipes' shared by Monzo users on public community forums, we illustrate the potentially diverse functions of these recipes, and how they are achieved through different kinds of automation. Beyond achieving more convenient and efficient financial management, we note many playful and expressive applications of conditionality and automation that far extend traditional functions of banking applications and infrastructure. We use these findings to map opportunities, challenges and areas of future research in the development of 'programmable money' and related financial technologies. Specifically, we present design implications for the extension of native digital banking applications; novel uses of banking data; the applicability of blockchains and smart contracts; and future forms of financial autonomy.

AB This paper reports on a co-speculative interview study with charitable donors to explore the future of programmable, conditional and data-driven donations. Responding to the rapid emergence of blockchain-based and AI-supported financial technologies, we specifically examine the potential of automated, third-party 'escrows', where donations are held before they are released or returned based on specified rules and conditions. To explore this we conducted pilot workshops with 9 participants and an interview study in which 14 further participants were asked about their experiences of donating money, and invited to co-speculate on a service for programmable giving. The study elicited how data-driven conditionality and automation could be leveraged to create novel donor experiences, however also illustrated the inherent tensions and challenges involved in giving programmatically. Reflecting on these findings, our paper contributes implications both for the design of programmable aid platforms, and the design of escrow-based financial services in general.

AB Blockchain technology allows running ordered transactions within an immutable public ledger in a decentralized manner. It consists of two processes: advertisement where the participants become aware of the new transactions and chain extension where the validated transactions are added into a block by extending the chain. Existing blockchain protocols have mainly focused on the chain extension, though the advertisement process has not been dealt with in depth. More specifically, transaction advertisement is fulfilled in an altruistic manner and the same gossip-like propagation mechanism is used for both transactions and blocks. Consequently, the existing protocols are not only incompatible within a rational setting where participants try to maximize their benefit but also suffering from inefficient bandwidth usage.
   In this work, we propose Tulip, a two-layered blockchain framework, which enriches any blockchain protocol with respect to the aforementioned advertisement issues. Tulip treats the advertisement and chain extension processes separately. Transactions are collected and verified by a transaction collector, whereas extending the chain with a new block is done by a round leader. In order to achieve a generic framework, we model the basic functionalities of a ledger. These functionalities are realized by any existing blockchain protocol and responsible for the chain extension process. Thanks to the modular structure of Tulip, the chain extension process can be combined with an incentive compatible and bandwidth-efficient advertisement process. Tulip can be built upon any blockchain protocol while preserving the ledger properties persistence and liveness. Moreover, it enhances the liveness into strong liveness property which requires only one honest participant, rather than all, to advertise a transaction. In this manner, to the best of our knowledge, Tulip forms the first blockchain protocol having incentive compatible chain extension and transaction advertisement processes. Finally, we show that Tulip can be used to reduce redundant bandwidth usage by up to 99%.

TI Initial Coin Offerings: Emerging Technology's Fundraising Innovation
SO UCLA LAW REVIEW
AB As Bitcoin becomes popular among the masses and blockchain technology is adopted among different industries, more people have been investing in new cryptocurrencies in hopes of making a fortune. A cryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses code to verify transactions via a peer-to-peer network. Since 2016, emerging technology companies have increasingly opted to conduct initial coin offerings (ICO) to fund the development of their networks rather than pitch to venture capitalists or hold an IPO. In an ICO, developers sell a new cryptocurrency, sometimes called a token, that allows exclusive access to their network without selling off equity or granting investors voting rights. Retail investors looking for the next cryptocurrency to make Bitcoin-level gains in value are investing significant capital into these tokens without the protections afforded by the SEC for similar investment opportunities. In 2017, billions of dollars were raised by these ICOs, and many investors were duped by fraudulent sales. This year, ICOs are on pace to raise over $10 billion.
   The U.S. government has regulated ICOs inconsistently. The SEC identifies most ICO "tokens" as securities, the IRS taxes them as property, and the FinCEN regulates them as money. For the SEC, applying the traditional Howey test to these tokens has proven difficult. While some tokens are clearly securities, others may not be, due to their independent utility as a means to access proprietary networks. Regardless, SEC warnings have not subdued ICOs. This Comment presents a new legal framework that meets the interests of the SEC, investors, and the innovative companies in the cryptocurrency industry.

AB In massive, dynamic and distributed P2P networks like Bitcoin, where thousands of updates occur per second, it is hard to obtain an accurate topology representing the structure of the network as a graph with nodes and links by using the traditional local measurement approaches based on batches, offline data, or on the discovery of the topology around a small set of nodes and then combine them to discover an approximate network topology. All of which present some limitation when applying them on blockchain-based networks. In this paper, we propose a topology discovery system, which performs a real-time data collection and analysis for Bitcoin P2P links with the use of a customized version of the Page-Rank algorithm that assembles incoming nodes information for deeper graph analysis processing. The topology discovery system allows us to gain knowledge on the Bitcoin network size, the network stability in term of well-connected Bitcoin nodes, as well as some data regarding the Bitcoin nodes geolocation.

TI Cryptocurrencies, Monetary Policy, and New Forms of Monetary Sovereignty
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The article aims to bring to light the limits and contradictions of cryptocurrencies, as well as to investigate possible alternative uses of them. Particularly focusing on Bitcoin, understood as a benchmark for the entire sector, the authors seek to answer the following questions: Should Bitcoin be considered a currency, an investment vehicle, or a speculative asset? On which factors does Bitcoin volatility depend? Do Central Banks effectively have no power to influence/stabilize Bitcoin volatility? Following the empirical strategy proposed by Baek and Elbeck, the article shows that Bitcoin returns merely depend on financial conventions and that the cryptocurrency is acting as a highly speculative asset. Sociotechnical innovations introduced by Bitcoin, the authors argue, have concretely opened the possibility of deeply rethinking money. However, several factors are currently negatively affecting the possibility of the cryptocurrency to function as an effective means of payment. Whether this experience can pave the way for the birth of new and more democratic monetary instruments, as the article discusses, is an issue that calls into question a whole combination of political, technical and social elements.

AB In recent years, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) has been playing a more and more important role in building trust and security for Internet of Things (IoT). However, the unacceptable performance of the current mainstream DLT systems such as Bitcoin can hardly meet the efficiency and scalability requirements of IoT. In this paper, we propose a scalable transactive smart homes infrastructure by leveraging a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based DLT and following the separation of concerns (SOC) design principle. Based on the proposed solution, an experiment with 40 Home Nodes is conducted to prove the concepts. From the results, we find that our solution provides a high transaction speed and scalability, as well as good performance on security and micropayment which are important in IoT settings. Then, we conduct an analysis and discuss how the new system breaks out the well-known Trilemma, which claims that it is hard for a DLT platform to simultaneously reach decentralization, scalability and security. Finally, we conclude that the proposed DAG-based distributed ledger is an effective solution for building an IoT infrastructure for smart communities.

TI Cryptocurrencies and the Denationalization of Money
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB The theoretical foundations of bitcoin have been frequently traced back to the Austrian school of economics. To the extent that cryptocurrencies are not issued by a centralized authority and do not rely on an official legal tender status for their acceptance, they may indeed appear as a dramatic departure from the historical trend that has led, over the past few centuries, to the making of national money and as a decisive step toward the denationalization of money advocated by F. A. von Hayek. This article investigates to what extent bitcoin truly embodies the principles of stable money prescribed by Hayek and whether the proliferation of cryptocurrencies constitutes a Hayekian monetary competition.

AB The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) consists of the pervasive application of the IoT paradigm in conjunction with analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial scenarios. Industry 4.0 (I4.0) extends further the IIoT model with the inclusion of robotics and automation, whereas Hospital 4.0 (H4.0) is the application of the I4.0 paradigm to the healthcare sector. H4.0 relies on cyber-physical systems managing several devices and software components. and the exchange of a huge amount of sensible data that includes medical records. Medical records can be much more valuable to criminals than financial data, indeed the control of medical data allows criminals to plan and realize different frauds, that the victims may identify only too late. Furthermore, the complexity of a typical H4.0 cyber-physical system makes healthcare records particularly vulnerable. Blockchain is today an emerging technology for the management of data that may avoid or mitigate the impact of threats related to data storage and management, in general, and to the administration, in particular, of healthcare records. The blockchain technology relies on cryptography and distributed consensus to guarantee data integrity, accountability and security. The exploitation of such technology is considered in this chapter, showing the advantages when used in a H4.0 scenario.

TI Trust, reputation and ambiguous freedoms: financial institutions and
   subversive libertarians navigating blockchain, markets, and regulation
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB This article departs from the post 2008 financial crisis context, from its intersection with technological developments, and from the socio-technical arrangements configured by this conjuncture. It explores plans and actions- of mainstream financial institutions, and of a community seeking for alternatives to centralised economy and governance- for the use of digital platforms supported by blockchain infrastructure. In particular, it explores how such plans and actions relate to conceptions of public and peer trust and how they appear to produce, or reinforce, reputational imaginaries and quantification practices within added value philosophies. By illuminating a tension between the two identified case examples, I seek to render alternative communities' and financial institutions' conceptions, imaginaries and practices (more) visible and to analyse their organisational marketing strategies- where there is a pragmatic and discursive operationalisation of technology as well as of trust as means to gain more self-sovereignty in action, while navigating markets and regulated actual world contexts.

Drawing on a collaborative ethnography with the Economic Space Agency (ECSA), a start-up developing post-blockchain technology, this paper illustrates how metaphors mimic the toponymy of decentralized material infrastructures, while simultaneously pushing forward 'posthuman' values that are expected to become fixated through software. Through an analysis of a 'collection' of metaphors produced by ECSA, this paper sheds light on the work performed by specific vocabularies, within technological communities, in shaping a symbiotic relationship between futuristic politics and material culture.

AB Improvements in clock speed and exploitation of Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) hit a roadblock during mid-2000s. This, coupled with the demise of Dennard scaling, led to the rise of multi-core machines. Today, multi-core processors are ubiquitous and architects have moved to specialization to work around the walls hit by single-core performance and chip Thermal Design Power (TDP). The pressure of innovation in the aftermath of Dennard scaling is shifting to software developers, who are required to write programs that make the most effective use of underlying hardware. This work presents quantitative and qualitative analyses of how software has evolved to reap the benefits of multi-core and heterogeneous computers, compared to state-of-the-art systems in 2000 and 2010. We study a wide spectrum of commonly-used applications on a state-of-the-art desktop machine and analyze two important metrics, Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) and GPU utilization.
   We compare the results to prior work over the last two decades, which state that 2-3 CPU cores are sufficient for most applications and that the GPU is usually under-utilized. Our analyses show that the harnessed parallelism has improved and emerging workloads show good utilization of hardware resources. The average TLP across the applications we study is 3.1, with most applications attaining the maximum instantaneous TLP of 12 during execution. The GPU is over-provisioned for most applications, but workloads such as cryptocurrency mining utilize it to the fullest. Overall, we conclude that the effectiveness of software in utilizing the underlying hardware has improved, but still has scope for optimizations.

TI In Search of Self-Sovereign Identity Leveraging Blockchain Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent times, with the advent of blockchain technology, there is an optimism surrounding the concept of self-sovereign identity which is regarded to have an in fiuential effect on how we interact with each other over the Internet in future. There are a few works in the literature which examine different aspects of self-sovereign identity. Unfortunately, the existing works are not methodological and comprehensive at all. Moreover, there exist different notions of what the term self-sovereign identity means. To exploit its full potential, it is essential to ensure a common understanding in a formal way. This paper aims to achieve this goal by providing the first-ever formal and rigorous treatment of the concept of self-sovereign identity using a mathematical model. This paper examines the properties that a self-sovereign identity should have and explores the impact of self-sovereign identity over the laws of identity. It also highlights the essential life-cycles of an identity management system and inter-relates how the notion of self-sovereign identity can be applied in these life-cycles. In addition, the paper illustrates several envisioned flows involving a self-sovereign identity leveraging blockchain technology covering different aspects of an identity management system. All in all, this paper presents the first formal and comprehensive step toward an academic investigation of self-sovereign identity.

AB The IoT (Internet of Things) is a network composed of several devices (things) connected to the Internet and to each other. IoT services are increasingly growing and are allowing companies to deploy scalable solutions with reduced costs and instantaneous data access. These solutions require seamless authentication, data privacy, security, robustness against attacks, easy deployment, and self- maintenance. Such requirements can be given to a company's IoT solution by applying blockchain technology. This paper analyzes the blockchain technology and the advantages and challenges behind its implementation in an IoT environment. A blockchain in IoT scenario was developed to evaluate the performance of different cryptographic hash functions in the IoT device RaspberryPi. Conclusions were drawn when it comes to the viability of some hash functions mainly based on the low resource characteristic shared by the IoT devices, which compromises the performance of the hash function.

AB The Bitcoin protocol induces miners, through monetary rewards, to expend energy in order to add blocks to the chain. We show that, when energy costs are substantial and taken into account, counterintuitive and unintended strategic behavior results: In a simple bounded-horizon setting with two identical miners there is a unique pure symmetric equilibrium in which both miners first "slow down" in order to decrease the crypto complexity and then take advantage of this decrease. If miners have different energy efficiencies and are restricted to choose the same hash rate for many epochs, there is a unique pure equilibrium in which miners either participate at low levels that depend in intricate ways on all the other miners' efficiencies, or choose to abstain from mining if their efficiency is too low. In the general setting in which miners can adapt their hash rates over time, we show that, unless the number of miners is very small, the only possible pure equilibria are rather chaotic, with miners quitting and starting again periodically-or there is no pure equilibrium at all. We discuss the implications of these results for the stability of proof-of-work protocols.

AB It is a common narrative that blockchains are immutable and so it is technically impossible to erase data stored on them. For legal and ethical reasons, however, individuals and organizations might be compelled to erase locally stored data, be it encoded on a blockchain or not. The common assumption for blockchain networks like Bitcoin is that forcing nodes to erase data contained on the blockchain is equal to permanently restricting them from participating in the system in a full-node role. Challenging this belief, in this paper, we propose and demonstrate a pragmatic approach towards functionality-preserving local erasure (FPLE). FPLE enables full nodes to erase infringing or undesirable data while continuing to store and validate most of the blockchain. We describe a general FPLE approach for UTXO-based (i.e., Bitcoin-like) cryptocurrencies and present a lightweight proof-of-concept tool for safely erasing transaction data from the local storage of Bitcoin Core nodes. Erasing nodes continue to operate in tune with the network even when erased transaction outputs become relevant for validating subsequent blocks. Using only our basic proof-of-concept implementation, we are already able to safely comply with a significantly larger range of erasure requests than, to the best of our knowledge, any other full node operator so far.

AB Blockchains and smart contracts are an emerging, promising technology, that has received considerable attention. We use the blockchain technology, and in particular Ethereum, to implement a large-scale event-based Internet of Things (IoT) control system. We argue that the distributed nature of the "ledger," as well as, Ethereum's capability of parallel execution of replicated "smart contracts", provide the sought after automation, generality, flexibility, resilience, and high availability. We design a realistic blockchain-based IoT architecture, using existing technologies while by taking into consideration the characteristics and limitations of IoT devices and applications. Furthermore, we leverage blockchain's immutability and Ethereum's support for custom tokens to build a robust and efficient token-based access control mechanism. Our evaluation shows that our solution is viable and offers significant security and usability advantages.

AB IoT trust management is a security solution that assures the trust between different IoT entities before establishing any relationship with other anonymous devices. Recent researches presented in the literature tend to use a Blockchain-based trust management model for IoT besides the fog node approach in order to address the constraints of IoT resources. Actually, Blockchain has solved many drawbacks of centralized models. However, it is still not preferable for dealing with massive data produced by IoT because of its drawbacks such as delay, network overhead, and scalability issues. Therefore, in this paper we define some factors that should be considered when designing scalable models, and we propose a fully distributed trust management model for IoT that provide a large-scale trust model and address the limitations of Blockchain. We design our model based on a new approach called Holochain considering some security issues, such as detecting misbehaviors, data integrity and availability.

TI A Solution for Secure Certified Electronic Mail Using Blockchain as a
   Secure Message Board
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The certified mail is a value-added service that is widely used in the paper world. However, the scientific community has not yet provided a solution for certified e-mail that has achieved widespread acceptance. This lack of a certified e-mail solution is not due to a lack of proposed approaches; because over the past 40 years, more than 100 protocols have been reported in journals and at conferences. The vast majority of these proposed protocols use a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness. The few solutions without a TTP have not been successful due to their high computational and/or communication cost. Blockchain provides a new approach to develop the protocols without a TTP but without the prior drawbacks of the previous solutions without a TTP. Here, we present a new protocol for certified e-mail based on a blockchain without a conventional TTP that is integrated with the conventional e-mail infrastructure. The protocol is secure, efficient, and viable from a practical perspective.

AB In the late 90s the author Ian Grigg defined that smart contracts have to be human-readable like paper contracts while remaining processible by computer programs. The Ethereum Foundation has created a new programming language Solidity that can be used to implement smart contracts. However, the contracts are neither easy to implement nor easy-to-use by the common user. In order to enable users without programming skills to take advantage of the new technology, we propose a generator for smart contracts. Our prototype uses a configuration wizard to determine the requirements of the generated contract. Based on the official ERC Standards of the Ethereum community we will implement a prototype that can configure and generate customized contracts. Moreover, we are covering the challenges that we have to face in order to support automated test case generation and automated deployment processes.

AB In this paper, we focus on the energy efficiency aware architecture of caching the necessary production messages and the transaction process to support a readable and tamper proof internet of things (IoT). To achieve this, blockchain can provide a reliable distributed storage of the messages, because any changes of the cached messages will break the structure of the blockchain. Specifically, we assume that the access points belonging to different telecom operators collect the messages in the IoT network, wherein multiple servers used for either caching or computing are placed at each access point. We define that the caching servers can be divided into the data loading caches for caching the received wireless IoT data and the data transmission caches for transmitting the IoT data into the blockchain based cloud caching servers. The blocks generated in the data loading caches at each access point will be written into the blockchain based on both the proof-of-work and the capacity of the data loading caches at each access point. Then, we formulate the optimization problem maximizing the system energy efficiency by optimizing the allocation of cache, computation and communication resources by a geometric programming model. By the CVX tool in matlab software, the geometric programming model can be solved effectively. We study the impact of different parameters involved in the blockchain on the system performance, and verify the effectiveness of our proposed energy efficiency aware optimization mechanism in the blockchain based IoT.

AB Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the run-time environment for smart contracts and its vulnerabilities may lead to serious problems to the Ethereum ecology. With lots of techniques being continuously developed for the validation of smart contracts, the testing of EVM remains challenging because of the special test input format and the absence of oracles. In this paper, we propose EVMFuzzer, the first tool that uses differential fuzzing technique to detect vulnerabilities of EVM. The core idea is to continuously generate seed contracts and feed them to the target EVM and the benchmark EVMs, so as to find as many inconsistencies among execution results as possible, eventually discover vulnerabilities with output cross-referencing. Given a target EVM and its APIs, EVMFuzzer generates seed contracts via a set of predefined mutators, and then employs dynamic priority scheduling algorithm to guide seed contracts selection and maximize the inconsistency. Finally, EVMFuzzer leverages benchmark EVMs as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. With EVMFuzzer, we have found several previously unknown security bugs in four widely used EVMs, and 5 of which had been included in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs in U.S. National Vulnerability Database.

AB Mimblewimble is an electronic cash system proposed by an anonymous author in 2016. It combines several privacy-enhancing techniques initially envisioned for Bitcoin, such as Confidential Transactions (Maxwell, 2015), non-interactive merging of transactions (Saxena, Misra, Dhar, 2014), and cut-through of transaction inputs and outputs (Maxwell, 2013). As a remarkable consequence, coins can be deleted once they have been spent while maintaining public verifiability of the ledger, which is not possible in Bitcoin. This results in tremendous space savings for the ledger and efficiency gains for new users, who must verify their view of the system.
   In this paper, we provide a provable-security analysis for Mimblewimble. We give a precise syntax and formal security definitions for an abstraction of Mimblewimble that we call an aggregate cash system. We then formally prove the security of Mimblewimble in this definitional framework. Our results imply in particular that two natural instantiations (with Pedersen commitments and Schnorr or BLS signatures) are provably secure against inflation and coin theft under standard assumptions.

AB In the context of transportation technologies for smart city, recently, self-driving and connected cars have been studied with increased attention to realize more efficient and safer transportation. On the other hand, applications of blockchain and its Layer 2 technologies to IoT and cyber-physical systems have been considered for achieving sharing economy. The blockchain explores new incentive-based value exchange system using reliable data structure with resistance to information tampering despite the absence of reliable central control. In this paper, we propose a distributed system for collaborative traffic information gathering and sharing incentivized by blockchain technology. I consider that beacon devices are deployed along road segments by many and unspecified users. These devices collaboratively estimate traffic count and status, and also detect traffic jam and accidents to gather and share them coordinated by the incentive from its digital currency. After introducing an idea of how to realize this system, I demonstrate numerical simulations to evaluate some preliminary results for how the proposed system works and responds to real-time traffic conditions, such as traffic accident and jam in the road segment.

AB Proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols are emerging as one of the most promising alternative to the wasteful proof-of-work (PoW) protocols for consensus in Blockchains (or distributed ledgers). However, current PoS protocols inherently disclose both the identity and the wealth of the stakeholders, and thus seem incompatible with privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies (such as ZCash, Monero, etc.). In this paper we initiate the formal study for PoS protocols with privacy properties. Our results include:
   1. A (theoretical) feasibility result showing that it is possible to construct a general class of private PoS (PPoS) protocols; and to add privacy to a wide class of PoS protocols,
   2. A privacy-preserving version of a popular PoS protocol, Ouroboros Praos. Towards our result, we define the notion of anonymous verifiable random function, which we believe is of independent interest.

TI BFR-MPC: A Blockchain-Based Fair and Robust Multi-Party Computation
   Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In a general secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol, two or more participants who do not trust each other, use their respective secret inputs to calculate a joint function in a distributed environment without a centralized organization. They can get correct outputs on the premise of ensuring privacy and independence of input. In this paper, to solve the problem of fairness and robustness in MPC, a blockchain-based multi-party computation scheme (BFR-MPC) was proposed. The blockchain maintains an open reputation system for parties as a public ledger where a more reputable party has a greater chance to be selected. The block height is used as a trusted timestamp. In each round, parties must send the correct information before the deadline. In our scheme, all parties are considered to be foresighted, and an incentive mechanism encourages parties to cooperate rather than deviate from the protocol. Because of non-cooperative parties will be immediately expelled from the protocol and will be penalized financially, the proposed scheme is robust. The penalty will be used to reward honest parties. We also proved the fairness of our scheme through Game Theory. The comparison results of the proposed scheme with other schemes show that it is a more practical scheme for MPC with high fairness and robustness.

TI An Anti-Quantum E-Voting Protocol in Blockchain With Audit Function
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB As an important method of making democratic decisions, voting has always been a topic of social concern. Compared with the traditional, e-voting is widely used in various decision scenarios because of the convenience, easy to participate and low cost. However, the proposed e-voting protocols are at the risk of excessive authority and tampered information, which makes it impossible to achieve true fairness and transparency in e-voting. By combining the blockchain technology, it enables to solve these problems with the decentralization and tamper-resistant features. Moreover, the misoperations of the voters will also affect this fairness, such as voting for non-candidates, abstention or repeated voting. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency of the voting process and maintain the fairness of the voting environment, it is important to append the function of audit in e-voting protocol. This paper proposes an e-voting protocol based on blockchain, which provides transparency in the process of voting. At the same time, this scheme has the ability to audit voters operating incorrectly and resist quantum attacks by adopting the certificateless and code-based cryptography. After performance analysis, our scheme is suitable for the small-scale election and has some advantages in security and efficiency when the number of voters is small.

AB Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks have emerged as a new technology in modern electric power transmission networks. It allows bi-directional flow of communication and electricity between electric vehicles (EVs) and the Smart Grid (SG), in order to provide more sophisticated energy trading. However, due to the involvement of a huge amount of trading data and the presence of untrusted entities in the visiting networks, the underlying V2G infrastructure suffers from various security and privacy challenges. Although, several solutions have been proposed in the literature to address these problems, issues like lack of mutual authentication and anonymity, incapability to protect against several attack vectors, generation of huge overhead, and dependency on centralized infrastructures make security and privacy issues even more challenging. To address the above mentioned problems, in this paper, we propose a blockchain oriented hierarchical authentication mechanism for rewarding EVs. The overall process is broadly classified into the following phases: 1) System Initialization, 2) Registration, 3) Hierarchical Mutual Authentication, and 4) Consensus; wherein blockchain's distributed ledger has been employed for transaction execution in distributed V2G environments while Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has been used for hierarchical authentication. The designed hierarchical authentication mechanism has been employed to preserve the anonymity of EVs and support mutual authentication between EVs, charging stations (CSs) and the central aggregator (CAG). Additionally, it also supports minimal communicational and computational overheads on resource constrained EVs. Further, formal security verification of the proposed scheme on widely accepted Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool validates its safeness against different security attacks.

AB The blockchain technology enables mutually untrusting participants to reach consensus on the state of a distributed and decentralized ledger (called a blockchain) in a permissionless setting. The consensus protocol of the blockchain imposes a unified view of the system state over the global network, and once a block is stable in the blockchain, its data is visible to all users and cannot be retrospectively modified or removed. Due to these properties, the blockchain technology is regarded as a general consensus infrastructure and based on which a variety of systems have been built.
   This article presents a study and survey of permissionless blockchain systems in the context of secure logging. We postulate the most essential properties required by a secure logging system and by considering a wide range of applications, we give insights into how the blockchain technology matches these requirements. Based on the survey, we motivate related research perspectives and challenges for blockchain-based secure logging systems, and we highlight potential solutions to some specific problems.

AB Large-scale distributed systems are becoming more widespread and, at the same time, their sizes grow day by day. In this type of systems, the adoption of blockchains is gaining particular traction for data storage in a secure and distributed manner. Nevertheless, design and testing of new protocols and features face the challenge of determining whether the proposed modifications would actually improve the system as expected. In the case of existing cryptocurrency systems, building an evaluation platform poses additional difficulties due to the resource-consuming nature of the associated processes.
   In this paper, we propose a novel methodology that relies on container-based network emulation to create scalable local testbeds in which Proof-of-Work-based blockchain systems can be evaluated. Using one of the mainstream Ethereum clients, we replaced the mining algorithm with a simulation model built upon the statistical characteristics of the mining process and instrumented the client to capture relevant network events. These events are used to create an offline reconstruction of the global view of the blockchain and all forking events, and to completely characterize the working conditions under arbitrary setups.
   Based on the versatility and scalability of our platform, we are able to test several network scenarios of increasing size in which we analyze the incidence of the target time in the generation of contradictory views of the blockchain (i.e. forks). We show that even using a limited testbed constituted by just commodity hardware, it is possible to use our platform to study the dynamics of blockchain-based systems up to hundreds of nodes.

AB This paper introduces a novel Machine Sharing Economy (MSE) approach to support machine owners in sharing idle machine capacities by means of a marketplace. Manufacturing networks and supply chains are thus no longer static and driven by long-term agreements, but rather dynamic and time-bound. In such distributed manufacturing systems, it is important to keep track of the operations that have been performed, including relevant production information such as the actual machines performing a task, tools, and their parameters. We propose a tamper-proof blockchain-based framework to close the feedback cycle by emitting relevant events of the production process and storing process values in the blockchain. This paper describes the overall architecture of the system including a detailed discussion how the feedback cycle for distributed manufacturing systems has been realized using blockchains. In addition, we perform an empirical validation at a real-world digital factory and present our lessons learned.

AB Peer-to-peer systems are well-known patterns of distributed systems which created several revelations in designing ultra-scalable systems. Recently, these types of systems are evolved into cognitive peer-to-peer networks. Because of the distributed nature of Internet of Things (IoT), peer-to-peer systems such as blockchain can be used to design management mechanisms in IoT. Therefore, we need an architecture which facilitates the utilization of peer-to-peer systems in IoT based systems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no general architecture based on cognitive peer-to-peer networks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an architecture for managing IoT based on cognitive peer-to-peer networks. In order to study the potential of the proposed architecture, we suggest an adaptive search mechanism and also a topology management algorithm utilizing the proposed architecture. The results show the efficiency of the suggested algorithms. The proposed architecture may facilitate a new evolution from peer-to-peer systems to thing-to-thing systems.

AB Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX enclaves, use hardware to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of operations on sensitive data. While the technology is available on many processors, the complexity of its programming model and its performance overhead have limited adoption. TEEs provide a new and valuable hardware functionality that has no obvious analogue in programming languages, which means that developers must manually partition their application into trusted and untrusted components.
   This paper describes an approach that fully integrates trusted execution into a language. We extend the Go language to allow a programmer to execute a goroutine within an enclave, to use low-overhead channels to communicate between the trusted and untrusted environments, and to rely on a compiler to automatically extract the secure code and data. Our prototype compiler and runtime, GOTEE, is a backward-compatible fork of the Go compiler.
   The evaluation shows that our compiler-driven code and data partitioning efficiently executes both microbenchmarks and applications. On the former, GOTEE achieves a 5.2x throughput and a 2.3x latency improvement over the Intel SGX SDK. Our case studies, a Go ssh server, the Go tls package, and a secured keystore inspired by the go-ethereum project, demonstrate that minor source-code modifications suffice to provide confidentiality and integrity guarantees with only moderate performance overheads.

AB Blockchains and the GDPR pursue similar objectives where they seek to grant users greater control over their personal data. While the latter pursues this goal by imposing duties of care to centralized controllers and collectors of data, blockchains go a step beyond by trying to eliminate these stakeholders and the need to trust them. Nevertheless, the rules set out by the GDPR apply whenever personal data are at stake, and various actors of the blockchain ecosystem risk liability for controlling of processing data in violation of privacy requirements. A possible solution is to re-contextualize the concepts of data controlling and responsibility, as framed by the GDPR, in light of blockchains' enhanced individual autonomy. In this paper, we set the framework for a further inquiry on the role of users as both data subjects and data controllers of distributed ledgers.

AB Cryptocurrencies are a novel and disruptive technology that has prompted a new approach to how currencies work in the modern economy. As such, online discussions related to cryptocurrencies often go beyond posts about the technology and underlying architecture of the various coins, to subjective speculations of price fluctuations and predictions. Furthermore, online discussions, potentially driven by foreign adversaries, criminals or hackers, can have a significant impact on our economy and national security if spread at scale.
   This paper is the first to qualitatively measure and contrast discussion growth about three popular cryptocurrencies with key distinctions in motivation, usage, and implementation Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero on Reddit. More specifically, we measure how discussions relevant to these coins spread in online social environments how deep and how wide they go, how long they last, how many people they reach, etc. More importantly, we compare user behavior patterns between the focused community of the official coin subreddits and the general community across Reddit as a whole. Our Reddit sample covers three years of data between 2015 and 2018 and includes a time period of a record high Bitcoin price rise.(1)
   Our results demonstrate that while the largest discussions on Reddit are focused on Bitcoin, posts about Monero (a cryptocurrency often used by criminals for illegal transactions on the Dark Web(2)) start discussions that are typically longer and wider. Bitcoin posts trigger subsequent discussion more immediately but Monero posts are more likely to trigger a longer lasting discussion. We find that moderately subjective posts across all three coins trigger larger, longer, and more viral discussion cascades within both focused and general communities on Reddit. Our analysis aims to bring the awareness to online discussion spread relevant to cryptocurrencies in addition to informing models for forecasting cryptocurrency price that rely on discussions in social media.

AB In the contemporary world the issues of copyright and related rights protection have become indeed pressing. Copyright and related rights objects quite often cost a lot and it means their usage allows their owners to get a large profit. So an owner is highly motivated to establish a maximally full control over a legal fate of these immaterial benefits. Achievement of such control is exercised, on the one hand, by demands to observe the right of authorship regarding the object created, and on the other hand, due to the prohibition against its unauthorized use that valid for all third parties. Changing the cyberspace parameters that resulted in appearing of a new digital form of intellectual product, application of new digital ways of using copyright and related rights objects, domination of computer networks in the dissemination of intellectual products have considerably weakened and sometimes brought to nought an owner's control over the use of a creative result. In the opinion of a great number of researchers the discussed problems may be successfully solved by means of blockchain technology. The Russian Federation has already started to apply blockchain technology in the sphere of intellectual property. This article is intended for discussing the blockchain technology platforms being used for copyright and related rights protection.

AB This work explores a new low-latency distributed ledger structure based on bounded width directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this design, each user has their own blockchain traceable back to a common root. These individual chains mutually witness each other to confirm transactions and form a global partially ordered set of events. The number of witness hashes required to establish new blocks is defined as the "DAG width". This width has an upper bound which of the total number of users in the system, though the actual number of witnesses required is usually far less. In this paper we mathematically model the expected DAG width using analytical techniques from the near miss birthday problem and simulate expected widths for expected network latency and user activity.

AB In this paper we revisit the mining strategies in Proof of Work based cryptocurrencies and propose two strategies, which we call smart and smarter mining, that in many cases strictly dominate honest mining. In contrast to other known attacks, such as selfish mining, which induce zero-sum games among the miners, the strategies proposed in this paper increase miners' profit by reducing their variable costs (i.e., electricity). Moreover, the proposed strategies are viable for much smaller miners than previously known attacks and, surprisingly, an attack launched by one miner can be profitable for all other miners as well.
   While saving electricity is very encouraging for the environment, it may affect the coin's security. The smart and smarter mining strategies expose the coin to under 50% attacks, and this vulnerability might only grow when new miners join the coin in response to the increased profit margins induced by these strategies.

AB Blockchain technologies are expected to make a significant impact on a variety of industries. However, one issue holding them back is their limited transaction throughput, especially compared to established solutions such as distributed database systems. In this paper, we re-architect a modern permissioned blockchain system, Hyperledger Fabric, to increase transaction throughput from 3,000 to 20,000 transactions per second. We focus on performance bottlenecks beyond the consensus mechanism, and we propose architectural changes that reduce computation and I/O overhead during transaction ordering and validation to greatly improve throughput. Notably, our optimizations are fully plug-and-play and do not require any interface changes to Hyperledger Fabric.

AB Cybersecurity vulnerability assessment tools, frameworks, and methodologies are used to understand the cybersecurity maturity of a system or a facility. However, these tools are strictly developed based on standards defined by organizations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the U.S. Department of Energy; the majority of these tools and frameworks do not provide a platform to prioritize the requirements to reach a desired cybersecurity maturity. To address that challenge, we have been developing a framework and software application called cybersecurity vulnerability mitigation framework through empirical paradigm (CyFEr). CyFEr treats the problem at hand as a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) problem, which requires that various criteria be weighed relatively. Defining those weights is non-trivial and often leads to subjective decisions leading to undesired complications. To facilitate such a weighting system in CyFEr, we evaluated the application of various rank-weight methods (such as rank sum, reciprocal rank, rank exponent, and rank order centroid). The efficacy of those rank-weight methods was evaluated by applying them and testing against the blockchain cybersecurity framework (BC2F). BC2F was developed using the NIST cybersecurity framework to evaluate the cybersecurity posture of the blockchain nodes and networks in a given blockchain application or use-case. This paper provides 1) technical insights on the application of rank-weight methods to cybersecurity vulnerability assessments, 2) an overview of BC2F, 3) the application of rank-weight methods to BC2F, and 4) a depiction of the integration of the discussed rank-weight methods in CyFEr.

AB Research on electric profiles analysis is gaining momentum due to the smart meters rollout around the world and with big datasets being produced. Furthermore, new business models taking advantage of peer to peer schemes, blockchain technologies and decentralized electricity generation from renewable energy sources are emerging.
   The main objective of this paper is to characterize and typify consumer load profiles by economic sector and power level, later evaluating their potential complementarity and links to solar photovoltaic generation. It was performed a set of statistical data analysis over 15-minute electricity consumption data registries of the years 2014/2015 from a sample of over 3000 smart meters from the most relevant 10 economic sectors of a city. The city of tvora in Portugal was used as a case study.
   The results show that it has been possible to typify annual and daily profiles (mainly daily profiles) in several sectors, namely: public administration, retail, education, public lighting, health, and services. Additionally, it was disclosed that there is a huge complementarity between important economic sectors (either at a daily or seasonal level and with different power levels) identifying shared investments opportunities on PV systems.
   This work allowed to go forward in the analysis of electricity consumption at high temporal granularity, indicating its interest to improve the electric consumption rationality and promote the integration of renewables energies in many economic sectors.

AB The emergence of new connectivity services for automated transportation marks a paradigm shift for the operation of wireless networks. Furthermore, the advent of blockchain technology promises to enable a plethora of smart mobility services, which are not contingent on any central authorities. Concepts such as distributed ledger require efficient and reliable data dissemination between vehicles. Traditional techniques based on Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) are well known to scale poorly in all-cast networks due to the feedback implosion problem. Fountain and network coding techniques are arguably the most promising alternative solutions. In this paper we derive new analytical bounds on transmit message lengths and quantify bandwidth delay trade-offs for fountain coding based data dissemination for CAVs.

AB This paper describes the application of biometric-based cryptographic techniques to create secure electronic signatures on contract agreements of any kind or format. The described techniques couple password and biometric authentication factors to form a Biometric Authenticated Key Exchange (BAKE) protocol. The protocol provides mutual authentication and multi-factor user authentication, and defeats phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. The operation of BAKE establishes a secure channel of communications between two parties. This channel provides confidentiality for the user's authentication credentials and the contract agreement the user intends to sign. By including an indication of the user's intention to conduct an electronic transaction and the user's acceptance of the terms of the included contract agreement, the described application complies with the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act (UETA) and Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (ESIGN) Act requirements. The biometric electronic signature described in this paper is suitable for use in Cloud environments and in blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology smart contract applications.

AB As part of its ongoing efforts to meet the increased spectrum demand, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recently opened up 150 MHz in the 3.5 GHz hand for shared wireless broadband use. Access and operations in this band, aka Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), will be managed by a dynamic spectrum access system (SAS) to enable seamless spectrum sharing between secondary users (SUs) and incumbent users. Despite its benefits, SAS's design requirements, as set by FCC, present privacy risks to SUs, merely because SUs are required to share sensitive operational information (e.g., location, identity, spectrum usage) with SAS to be able to learn about spectrum availability in their vicinity. In this paper, we propose TrustSAS, a trustworthy framework lOr SAS that synergizes state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques with blockchain technology in an innovative way to address these privacy issues while complying with FCC's regulatory design requirements. We analyze the security of our framework and evaluate its performance through analysis, simulation and experimentation. We show that TrustSAS can offer high security guarantees with reasonable overhead, making it an ideal solution for addressing SUs' privacy issues in an operational SAS environment.

TI Passing cash from bank notes to bitcoin: standardizing money
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB This essay is about the modern bank note and bitcoin and how each standardizes money. Whether constituted by paper or protocol, whether performing (or failing) as a store of wealth, a medium of exchange, or unit of account, bank notes and bitcoins enact interchangeable equivalence with themselves, every one-pound note or bitcoin the same as another, and their mode of passing hand-to-hand or peer-to-peer also conscripts their holders as readily interchangeable. This essay examines the different ways that these two types of currency engineered this standardization, and I show how the new blockchain technology of Bitcoin innovated upon the standardizing process that made bank notes interchangeable. As I recount in the essay's first half, standardizing physical bank notes involved re-imagining them detached from the temporality of any specific contractual transaction so as to be, like coin, grasped as immediately physically interchangeable, and the bank note used print and the act of reading to do so. In the essay's second half, I discuss how, by contrast, Bitcoin standardizes money not by operating on any physical object, not even a digital one, but by creating a sense of immediately fungible value through maintaining the unique historicity of every transaction in the system.

AB Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks rise in frequency, diversity, and intensity. Often, centralized defense approaches lack hard- and software capabilities. A cooperative, multi-domain DDoS mitigation system provides defense services on top of an existing, distributed infrastructure. However, participants in these systems lack incentives for cooperation and reputation. Thus, reward systems can fill this gap by providing necessary incentives for cooperation among service providers and consumers. This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a reputation scheme for the Blockchain Signaling System (BloSS). A smart contract-enabled process automates reputation management to diminish malicious behavior by incentive design. Among other metrics, Beta reputation provides intelligence to identify and reward honest participants.

TI Autonomous Resource Request Transaction Framework Based on Blockchain in

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Currently, blockchain technology has been widely researched and is being applied to many other fields, such as financial transactions, E-government, logistics, and supply-chain system. It can be used to store and maintain transaction data through the de-centralized model. In this paper, we propose an autonomous resource request transaction framework based on blockchain in a social network, in which all kinds of resources in the social community can be traded through blockchain technology. When a user needs to acquire some resources from a community, the user may make a transaction with the members from the community through blockchain technology while the members autonomously negotiate each other to reach an agreement. The proposed framework provides an incentive mechanism to encourage community members to disseminate the resources through a smart contract.

AB In this paper, we identify and proposed an interface mechanism in blockchain for businesses based on user centric approach. The base of user centric approach in business is to increase user or consumer involvement in the business to increase the productivity. As productivity is an important factor in the field of Human Computer Interaction, our approach can increase user input and output, quality and innovation while decreasing costs, errors for business by using smart contact and user centric model defined by businesses. Smart contacts are big hit now a days as blockchain is becoming more mature. But user interaction to these contracts are very limited. Thus, user centric approach is not fully applicable for such scenario. Our scheme encompasses mechanism to involve the user in smart contract creation process with ease. We consider smart health care business and identify the points where smart contract can utilize the HCI.

AB User's digital identity information has privacy and security requirements. Privacy requirements include confidentiality of the identity information itself, anonymity of those who verify and consume a user's identity information and unlinkability of online transactions which involve a user's identity. Security requirements include correctness, ownership assurance and prevention of counterfeits of a user's identity information. Such privacy and security requirements, although conflicting, are critical for identity management systems enabling the exchange of users' identity information between different parties during the execution of online transactions. Addressing all such requirements, without a centralized party managing the identity exchange transactions, raises several challenges. This paper presents a decentralized protocol for privacy preserving exchange of users' identity information addressing such challenges. The proposed protocol leverages advances in blockchain and zero knowledge proof technologies, as the main building blocks. We provide prototype implementations of the main building blocks of the protocol and assess its performance and security.

AB Attribute-based access control makes access control decisions based on the assigned attributes of subjects and the access policies to protect objects by mediating operations from the subjects. Authority, which validates attributes of subjects, is one key component to facilitate attribute-based access control. In an increasingly decentralized society, multiple attributes possessed by subjects may need to be validated by multiple different authorities. This paper proposes a multi-authority attribute-based access control scheme by using Ethereum's smart contracts. In the proposed scheme, Ethereum smart contracts are created to define the interactions between data owner, data user, and multiple attribute authorities. A data user presents its attributes to different attribute authorities, and after successful validation of attributes, obtains attribute tokens from respective attribute authorities. After collecting enough attribute tokens, a smart contract will be executed to issue secret key to the data user to access the requested object. The smart contracts for multi-authority attribute-based access control have been prototyped in Solidity, and their performance has been evaluated on the Rinkeby Ethereum Testnet.

AB Blockchain can be used to ensure trust in a decentralized environment in which no trusted authority is available. Its original idea is to collect transactions in a block, and to chain the blocks together in such a way that attackers cannot forge the chain if the majority of the network is honest. Since its creation in 2008, blockchain technology has been used broadly in Internet to support decentralized payments, cloud computing, publishing, etc. This work focuses on public permissionless blockchain which neither guards against bad actors nor enforces access control. Named data networking (NDN) uses name-based routing and in-networking caching to support efficient content delivery, making it a promising future Internet architecture as well as a great network technology which can improve blockchain data delivery. Therefore, it is a very necessary task to enable deployment of blockchain applications over NDN. However, NDN is not immediately compatible with typical blockchain, since (permissionless) blockchain applications usually require broadcasting transactions and blocks in real time, which is not supported by the "pull" design of NDN.
   In this work, we propose BoNDN which enables blockchain applications over NDN. Unlike previous work, BoNDN follows the core design of NDN. We treat each type of blockchain data needed to be broadcast individually. Specifically, we rely on Interest broadcasting to support real-time broadcasting of blockchain transactions, which is small in size and can be brought by an Interest packet. In addition, we propose a subscription-push approach to support broadcasting of blockchain blocks, in which each miner performs subscription, and once a block is generated, the subscribed miner will receive the block.

TI Design and Optimization for Storage Mechanism of the Public Blockchain

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain has a broad development potential and application prospects. At present, huge storage volume on each node has become one of the primary bottlenecks that restrict the expansibility of blockchain. Optimization for storage mechanism has become a necessary way to accelerate the improvement of blockchain. There are a variety of solutions to relieve the storage burden by modifying the architecture of blockchain, but most of them weaken the decentralization property of the system, which is the core advantages of the blockchain. In this paper, an optimization scheme based on the redundant residual number system is proposed to dramatically reduce the storage volume of nodes in the blockchain system, and fault tolerance mechanism is designed based on the new storage scheme. The simulation experiments are performed to prove the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.

AB Since the concept of Indonesia as the world's maritime fulcrum was initiated in 2014, the Government of Indonesia has begun to quickly formulate Indonesia's maritime connectivity policy. Indonesia's so-called "sea highway" (Tol Laut) program is one of them. However, this policy is considered to be less effective in solving logistical distribution chain problems which often caused the high price of basic goods in the market. Based on the results of the authors' observation, the process of dismantling containers at Indonesian ports can take more than 4 days. This is quite alarming, Indonesian port is the key to logistics distribution both between Indonesian islands and the international world, yet the condition. Therefore, the writing team formulated a concept of Indonesian "E-Toll Laut" (sea e-highway) policy as an e-governance solution to improve port management in Indonesia. E-Toll Laut itself is a name that the team of authors designates to explain the mechanism of blockchain port management in Indonesia. Based on the author's research team, this system is proven to be able to guarantee accountability, simplify the monitoring process, and accelerate bureaucratic processes and port transactions that are considered as accidents of the dwelling time process in Indonesia. The writing team then used Makassar port as a case study to give clearer picture for the problem.

Yet today, these standards, from OAuth to RSS, seem to have failed to prevent the massive centralization of the Web at the hands of a few major corporations like Google and Facebook. We'll delve deep into the lessons of failed attempts to replace DNS like XRIs, identity systems like OpenID, and metadata formats like the Semantic Web, all of which were re-cuperated by centralized platforms like Facebook as Facebook Connect and the "Like" Button. Learning from the past, a new generation of blockchain standards and governance mechanisms may be our last, best chance to save the Web.

AB Blockchain technology has become extremely popular, during the last decade, mainly due to the successful application in the cryptocurrency domain. Following the explosion of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, blockchain solutions are being deployed in almost every aspect of transactional operations as a means to safely exchange digital assets between non-trusted parties.
   At the heart of every blockchain deployment is the consensus protocol, which maintains the consistency of the blockchain upon satisfying incoming transactions. Although many consensus protocols have been recently introduced, the most prevalent is Proof-of-Work, which scales the blockchain globally by converting the consensus problem to a competition based on cryptographic hash functions; a process called "mining".
   The Proof-of-Work consensus protocol employs memory hard algorithms in order to counteract ASIC or FPGA mining that may compromise the decentralization and democratization of the blockchain. Unfortunately, this leads to increased power consumption and scalability challenges since numerous processing units such as GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, are required to satisfy the ever-increasing operational requirements of blockchain deployments.
   In this paper, we perform an in-depth performance analysis and characterization of the most common memory-hard PoW algorithms running on NVIDIA GPUs. Motivated by our experimental findings, we apply a series of optimizations on Ethash algorithm, the consensus protocol of the Ethereum blockchain. The implemented optimizations accelerate performance by 14% and improve energy efficiency by 10% when executing on three NVIDIA GPUs. As a result, the optimized Ethash algorithm outperformed its fastest commercial implementation.

TI Blockchain-Based Outsourced Storage Schema in Untrusted Environment
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Outsourced data, as significant service offered by the cloud service provider (CSP), can effectively facilitate the data owner (DO) overcoming the storage limitations on massive data. To ensure the availability of data, DO usually outsources the data replications to multiple CSPs (multi-CSPs) and utilizes a third party metadata management (TPMM) to dominate the metadata of the corresponding replications. However, during the outsourced procedures, DO can hardly confirm the confidence of the TPMM who may take some malicious behaviors to affect the reliability of data. Thus, DO inevitably faces data security issues caused by the over-reliance on the semi-trusted TPMM to manage the metadata of replications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of reliable outsourced data service among multi-CSPs in untrusted environment, that is, how to reliably store and verify the metadata of the data replications in untrusted multi-CSPs environment. To address the problem, we use the novel blockchain technology as a medium to build a trusted outsourced service platform. Moreover, we fully consider the innovative characteristics of blockchain including decentralized architecture, redundancy storage, collective maintenance, and tamper resistant to ensure the data cannot be changed maliciously. We first design a blockchain-based outsourced service framework for storing data replications in untrusted environment, which contains three key layers, that is, storage layer, verification layer, and blockchain layer. Then, we devise a novel concept of verification peer (VP) for maintaining metadata stored by a form of blockchain, and each of which holds the entire blockchain locally to prevent metadata from being maliciously tampered with. Finally, based on the proposed model, we introduce a collaborative algorithm invoked by VPs to store and verify the metadata of replications. We present a completed analysis and conduct extensive experiments on multi-CSPs scenario. The evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance.

AB Blockchain technology offers an intelligent amalgamation of distributed ledger, Peer-to-Peer (P2P), cryptography, and smart contracts to enable trustworthy applications without any third parties. Existing blockchain systems have successfully either resolved the scalability issue by advancing the distributed consensus protocols from the control plane, or complemented the security issue by updating the block structure and encryption algorithms from the data plane. Yet, we argue that the underlying P2P network plane remains as an important but unaddressed barrier for accelerating the overall blockchain system performance. Our key insights from comparative assessments reveal the fact that P2P topology highly affects the broadcast speed of blockchain data, leading to poor performance and vulnerable to double spending attacks. In this paper, we introduce BlockP2P, a novel optimization design to accelerate broadcast efficiency and meanwhile retain the security. BlockP2P first operates the geographical proximity sensing clustering, which leverages K-Means algorithm for gathering proximity peer nodes into clusters. It follows by the hierarchical topological structure that ensures strong connectivity and small diameter based on node attribute classification. We finally propose the parallel spanning tree broadcast algorithm to enable fast data broadcast among nodes both in the intra- and inter- clusters. To clarify the influence of each tier, we carefully design and implement a blockchain network simulator. Evaluation results show that BlockP2P can exhibit promising performance compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.

AB Due to the increasingly complex nature of large-scale structural engineering projects, there is an increasing focus on the adoption and integration of technology. However, the construction sector tends to be further behind than most when it comes to the adoption of process-based innovative technologies. On the other hand, the decentralised, peer-to-peer principles of blockchain technology has recently attracted interest from a range of industries around the globe who are attempting to improve their business practices. This paper provides insights into the performance capabilities of blockchain technology in the construction industry and the feasibility of its potential adoption through use cases. It explores smart contract applications and the feasibility of integrating the technology with building information modelling and information management. Furthermore, the paper argues that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency of processes within the construction industry and eliminate issues surrounding trust, transparency and verification currently experienced in the sector.

AB The Bitcoin blockchain is a secure, distributed ledger that enables trusted transactions across untrusted entities. However, many applications need much faster transaction confirmation than that of the current Bitcoin blockchain. In this paper, we present a high-throughput, low-latency, deterministic confirmation mechanism called ACCEL for accelerating Bitcoin's block confirmation mechanism. Our key idea for achieving faster confirmation is the quick identification of singular blocks that provably belong to the blockchain. While it is impossible to determine with certainty if a block belongs to a blockchain when network delays are unbounded, singular block detection exploits the fact that the end-to-end latency between Bitcoin miners is substantially lower than the inter-block spacing and can be assumed to be upper bounded. ACCEL is especially suitable for low-latency, permissioned blockchains, where the block spacing can he optimized to the blockchain's small latencies to greatly improve throughput. We evaluate ACCEL's performance with extensive simulations and with a real implementation built with minimal changes to and fully compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain. We show that with appropriate bounds on the end-to-end latency, it is possible to reduce transaction confirmation latencies to milliseconds with ACCEL, and so meet the performance needs of a wide range of applications.

AB Performing a fair exchange without a Trusted Third Party (TTP) was considered to be impossible. With multi party computation and practices like Proof-of-Work (PoW), blockchain accomplishes a fair exchange in a trustless network. Data confidentiality is a key challenge that has to be resolved before adopting blockchain for enterprise applications where tokenized assets will be transferred. Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also, the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash, ZKSNARK has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of ZKSNARK is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. ZKSTARK, an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks. We propose a system that uses two indistinguishable hash functions along with ZKSTARK to improve the flexibility of blockchain platforms. The two indistinguishable hash functions are chosen from SHA3-finalists based on their security, performance and inner designs.

AB A distributed autonomous learning framework was developed by DAX LLC (Distributed Autonomous Everything) with the goal of revolutionizing what is known as the "eLearning Industry". Although some online platforms share DAX's vision for disrupting, democratizing, and improving accessibility to the online educational ecosystem, they do not offer the same level of security, adaptability, and appeal to the emerging computing technologies community as DAX. DAX's learning framework is built upon its own private blockchain with user-guided adaptation through a suite of distributed applications. This sophisticated architecture serves to protect the student's identity, provides verifiability of trust of historical records, and provides transparency of achievement for a given student encryption key. The inherent security of the private blockchain ensures computer hackers (or nefarious students) aren't poisoning or "gaming" the system. The world is rapidly evolving and internet access creates a changing landscape for traditional education systems. DAX recognizes the need for educational systems to evolve beyond being solely centers of knowledge to becoming the enablers of information sharing and immersive learning. The distributed autonomous classroom concept presented herein is a novel eLearning concept designed to continue to evolve to meet the ever-changing demands of the globally connected, technologically savvy, student of tomorrow.

AB Blockchain-based crowdfunding is an emerging economic phenomenon and a state-of-the-art strategy to finance ventures. It bears similarity to conventional crowdfunding, but has its own unique characteristics. Therefore the success factors that affect the outcome of traditional crowdfunding may have a different impact on blockchain-based crowdfunding. Despite that the number of blockchain-based crowdfunding campaigns has increased drastically in the past few years, there is a lack of good understanding of what the success factors are for them in comparison to the ones for conventional crowdfunding. Such understanding is crucial for companies to design their blockchain-based fundraising initiatives properly and facilitate potential investors to seek main signals and drivers of outstanding projects. Furthermore it could help regulators and market participants to understand how the existing regulatory framework applies to blockchain-based crowdfunding. Due to specific characteristics of blockchain-based crowdfunding, regulatory frameworks may require potential re-interpretation of requirements to allow an effective application of regulations. To fill this knowledge gaps, we have reviewed a set of relevant literature on success factors for conventional and blockchain-based crowdfunding. The result of this literature review sheds light on the directions for future research and development. The contribution of our work is a better understanding of the distinctions and similarities of blockchain-based crowdfunding compared to traditional crowdfunding.

AB Smart Communities seeks to thrive in a context of broadband economy, its engine and reason for being. The success of any community is a function of its economic backbone or the supply chain. A supply chain can be defined as the integration of customers, retailers, distributors and manufacturers. The changing technology has made the survival in commerce highly competitive and price sensitive. Blockchain technology can be the game-changer for decentralizing infrastructure and building a trust layer for business logic. BlockCom is a commerce model based on the emerging technology of blockchain. This paper presents a double auction scheme for energy trading between customers and suppliers. A smart contract implements a distributed algorithm to maximize individual participating profit. Parties bid to smart contract which act as auctioneer for maximizing the profit. Mathematical parameter named credibility score has been created to deal with trust issues in the decentralized network using byzantine fault tolerant mechanism. BlockCom provides a fresh perspective on the concept of supply chain and commerce.

AB A blockchain is a distributed ledger forming a distributed consensus on a history of transactions, and is the underlying technology for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. However, its applications are far beyond the financial sector. The transaction verification process for cryptocurrencies is much slower than traditional digital transaction systems. One approach to increase transaction speed and scalability is to identify a solution that offers faster Proof of Work. In this paper, we propose a method for accelerating the process of Proof of Work based on parallel mining rather than solo mining. The goal is to ensure that no more than two or more miners put the same effort into solving a specific block. The proposed method includes a process for selection of a manager, distribution of work and a reward system. This method has been implemented in a test environment that contains all the characteristics needed to perform Proof of Work for Bitcoin and has been tested, using a variety of case scenarios, by varying the difficulty level and number of validators. Preliminary results show improvement in the scalability of Proof of Work up to 34% compared to the current system.

AB Search and data retrieval services have attracted significant attention in blockchain networks, especially for rare resources. Therefore, our paper proposes a novel Gossip-based appropriate degree search strategy (GADSS) for rare resources. This strategy employs a periodical probing mechanism (PPM) to judge whether these resources are rare resources. Once the resource types are determined, searching probability for rare ones is increased by two-hop index replication with resource weight (TIR-RW). In addition, we also provide a Gossip-based appropriate degree search algorithm (GADSA), which utilizes the appropriate degree property as heuristic information to guide the search in dynamic environment. As compared to the conventional blockchain resource search algorithms, GADSA has the ability to reduce the message quantity substantially. The simulation results show that GADSS has the better search performance for rare resources, and maintains the lower network overhead.

AB Tor is a low-latency free anonymization network based on onion routing. In Tor, directory servers maintain a list of all nodes. It is, however, possible for a powerful adversary (e.g., law enforcement agencies) to seize or compromise enough directory servers and thus forge that list. Therefore, clients that obtained such a forged list of nodes can be effectively deanonymized. As a countermeasure, we propose to utilize a permissioned blockchain with a single voting committee that is privately "elected" by a verifiable random function (VRF). Since the blockchain provides us with integrity guarantees by design, we increase trust in the directory servers by decentralizing management of Tor nodes present in the shared list. We apply skiplist as an optimization reducing a validation overhead of newly joined nodes and clients. The proposed approach has only a small performance impact on the existing Tor infrastructure.

AB Ethereum is a decentralized Blockchain system that supports the execution of Turing-complete smart contracts. Although the security of the Ethereum ecosystem has been studied in the past, the network layer has been mostly neglected. We show that Go Ethereum (Geth), the most widely used Ethereum implementation, is currently vulnerable to eclipse attacks, effectively circumventing recently introduced security enhancements(1). Our false friends attack exploits the Kademlia-inspired peer discovery logic used by Geth and enables a low-resource eclipsing of long-running, remote victim nodes. An adversary only needs two hosts in distinct /24 subnets to launch the eclipse, which can then be leveraged to filter the victim's view of the Blockchain. We discuss fundamental properties of Geth's node discovery logic that enable the false friends attack, and propose countermeasures.

AB This paper attempts to measure the extent of impact of the City of Cape Town's open government data initiative, which has been operational since 2013. Given the relative scarcity of impact measurement frameworks, a framework is adapted from that of Verhulst and Young [1], as well as the Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework suggested by Stuermer and Dapp [2]. The idea is to trace the developments resultant from the use of open data from various sources, mainly the City of Cape Town's open data portal. Several activities and developments are identified and classified under a classification scheme adapted from development pathways relevant to a developing country context. The development pathways are identified from literature. After the developments are traced, critical impact analysis is carried out using the SROI framework. The findings suggest that although there are some indications of impact, such impact is only confined to groups with specialised and specific interest in various types of open data. Additionally, awareness of the existence of open data-sets is also minimal, which significantly decreases the likelihood of use, ergo, impact. Policy suggestions to increase likelihood of use and impact are then presented.

AB Among the characteristics of blockchain-based Smart Contracts, the aspect of irreversibility of blockchain transactions is one of the most controversially commented features from a legal perspective - taking into account that "traditional" contracts can be void or voidable for various reasons. But while there are indeed cases where existing private law concepts struggle to provide sound and predictable solutions to Smart Contract-induced problems, many of these controversies derive either from the use of disambiguous terminology in interdisciplinary communication, the diversity of the instrument of voidness and avoidance from a comparative perspective (and thus not the Smart Contract as such) or a general "misconception" of the irreversability of traditional forms of performance. This contribution intends to clarify where the irreversability of blockchain-based transactions does - against all odds - not make a difference compared to traditional contract law solutions, but also determines where legal conflicts indeed may arise from Smart Contracts and mistake.

AB Each manufacturer, supplier, and retailer has its own chain of collaborating stakeholders to meet their customer demands Many perspectives can be taken like food safety, security, and sustainability, which may each lead to separate solutions that are not necessarily interoperable with each other. Data can only be shared within the context of those solutions and only with extra effort, and thus costs, across these solutions. To address this solution, this paper proposes a methodological approach for specification of data that can be shared with rapid deployment by for instance a blockchain based - or a peer-to-peer infrastructure. The methodological approach is based on basic informatics principles like the Turing machine and ontologies. (C) 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Trustworthy Product Lifecycle Management Using Blockchain
   Technology-Experience from the Automotive Ecosystem
SO PRODUCT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT, VOL 4: THE CASE STUDIES
SE Decision Engineering
AB Rooted on the principle "from cradle to grave", the lifecycle-driven approach to managing products like automobiles and related services has been recognised as a pivotal approach in research and practice [5, 15]. Digital technologies have continuously fostered the further development of product lifecycle management (PLM) in recent decades [17]. Nowadays, novel disruptive technologies offer even more important advances for providers and users of such solutions alike [14]. For the case of the automotive industry, intelligent products have created seamless visibility over the vehicle operations [9], big data techniques allow for the creation of sound insights [10], and blockchain technology holds the potential for trustworthy vehicle data management [2, 7]. The economic potential of preventing fraud and providing correct data is vast. Solely for the case of mileage manipulation, financial damage of around 9 billion Euro is estimated for the European Union [3]. Accurate data establishing the basis for digital services potentially delivers a global revenue in the 100 billion Euro range [11]. While these benefits of decentralised and encrypted data management are clear in theory [6, 18], less knowledge is available about the practical implementation of such blockchain-based solutions [2, 7]. The purpose of this case study [19] is to reflect experiences from a project in the setting of a leading automotive player which targets development and roll out of a trustworthy product lifecycle management using blockchain technology. Specifically, the study at hand mirrors insights from the automotive ecosystem focusing on the business-to-business context, involving fleets, OEMs, and repair shops. Such a case study seems valuable as research and practice call for real-world insights on blockchain applications especially outside the financial industry [1]. After this abstract, the second part of the case study provides a sketch of product lifecycle management and blockchain technology itself. In the third part, further details on the case of vehicle operations in the automotive ecosystem are given. The fourth part illustrates findings in terms of experience from the realisation of trustworthy product lifecycle management. In the fifth part, a discussion on the diverse and relevant hurdles to overcome is followed by a description of limitations and a view towards the future.

AB The aim of this research is to propose a new blockchain network model that facilitates the secure dissemination of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data. The primary motivations for this study are based around the recent changes to information security legislation in the European Union and the challenges that Computer Security and Incident Response Teams (CSIRT) face when trying to share actionable and highly sensitive data within systems where participants do not always share the same interests or motivations. We discuss the common problems within the domain of CTI sharing and we propose a new model, that leverages the security properties of blockchain. Our model provides a more effective and efficient framework for a CTI sharing network that has the potential to overcome the trust barriers and data privacy issues inherent in this domain. We implemented a testbed using Hyperledger Fabric and the STIX 2.0 protocol and validated the efficacy of the segmentation, implemented using smart contracts and Fabric channels.

TI The blockchain as a backbone of GDPR compliant frameworks
SO QUALITY-ACCESS TO SUCCESS
AB General data protection regulation (GDPR) is applied since 25 May 2018. It is designed to harmonize data privacy laws in European Union. It clearly defines what personal data is and identifies involved objects as Controller, Processor and Data subject. Although it focuses over the procedures in the organizations that have contact with personal data, it raises technological challenges about data storage, data processing, access control, identity management, system resilience, cybersecurity, post security breach measures, transactions traceability. We offer a new conceptual model with a trust management technology between controllers and data processors, which is based on the capabilities of the DLT. It can be useful in synthesizing software architectures, managing change due to the implementation of GDPR, ePrivacy, Policy Directive, and another forthcoming EU legislation. The article aims to present where the blockchain implementation can be helpful for the GDPR compliant operations. It doesn't cover the GDPR or blockchain in deep technical details, but just points out the important aspects where the DLT solution could be applicable. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the paper. Section 2 describes the methodology used in this article. Section 3 introduces the GDPR and points out with short descriptions the key principles of the regulation. Section 4 covers brief explanation what blockchain is with examples from the Bitcoin implementation. Terms like transaction, transactions integrity, block, consensus are described here. Permissioned and permissionless blockchain implementations with their basic difference in the level of trust. Section 5 defines the main intersection points between GDPR compliance and the blockchain. Section 6 presents the Hyperledger fabric blockchain framework founded by Open Linux Foundation and IBM. The section focuses over the unique Hyperledger fabric abilities, which leads to increased confidentiality, transaction speed, traceability, access control, identity management, endorsement policies and smart contracts applications. Section 7 shows related research in this area. In conclusion the study reveals the biggest challenge in the blockchain application in the GDPR compliant frameworks.

TI THE FACELESS COIN: ACHIEVING A MODERN TAX POLICY IN THE CHANGING
   LANDSCAPE OF CRYPTOCURRENCY
SO UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW
AB As technology continues to evolve at breakneck speed, the tax treatment of virtual currency has reached an inflection point. Now, given its shifting dynamics, how should we classify and tax virtual currency? This Note argues that the primary differentiator amongst the many different forms of virtual currency lies in its ability to be sold or exchanged for real world goods and services. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") currently treats all transactions involving virtual currency as a realization event, requiring taxpayers to calculate their tax consequences even in situations where there is no receipt of a real-life benefit. This Note suggests that the IRS should adopt the proposed Cryptocurrency Tax Fairness Act along with the more sensible three-part definition of virtual currency as introduced by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. Taxpayers should not have to worry about whether or not their use of virtual currency solely in the virtual world will result in real-world taxable income.

TI Collaborative Optimization of Distributed Scheduling Based on Blockchain
   Consensus Mechanism Considering Battery-Swap Stations of Electric
   Vehicles
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The proliferation of electric vehicles and active distribution network has brought many uncertainties to the power system. If the power system involves battery-swap stations of electric vehicles, it is difficult to ensure the data security during the distributed scheduling. To solve the problem, this paper sets up a collaborative optimization model for distributed scheduling based on blockchain consensus mechanism, considering the battery-swap stations. The power system was divided into three levels: the transmission network level, the distribution network level and the battery-swap station level. Next, the objective functions were constructed to minimize the generation cost and daily load variance on each level, and the optimal scheduling plan for the power system was solved through multi-level collaborative optimization. The blockchain consensus mechanism was adopted to verify the accuracy of the transaction data, and the production data of all entities were encoded by hash function before storage, such that the data are tamper resistant and traceable. The example analysis shows that our model can effectively reduce the generation cost, lower the daily load variance, and enhance system stability. The research findings shed new light on maintaining the optimization efficiency and data confidentiality of modern power network.

TI A Blockchain-Based Byzantine Consensus Algorithm for Information
   Authentication of the Internet of Vehicles
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper attempts to solve the security problems in communication, consensus-making and authentication of nodes in the Internet of vehicles (IoV) for intelligent transport. Considering the defects of the central node and service complexity in the IoV, the blockchain was integrated with the IoV to create a decentralized mechanism for communication and consensus-making. In the architecture of the blockchain-based IoV, the Byzantine consensus algorithm based on time sequence and gossip protocol is used to complete information communication and consensus authentication, which not only ensures communication security, improves the consensus efficiency of nodes, but also improves the fault tolerance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that our algorithm outshined the traditional authentication method in information security and consensus efficiency of the IoV. The research findings provide a reference solution to the authentication problems in the IoV for intelligent transport.

AB Blockchain technology is increasingly being adopted as a trusted platform to support business functions including trusted and verifiable transactions, tracking, and validation. However, most business use-cases require privacy and confidentiality for data and transactions. As a result, businesses are forced to choose private blockchain solutions and unable to take full advantage of the capabilities, benefits and infrastructure of public blockchain systems. To address this issue, we present an Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) security solution built on a private-over-public (PoP) blockchain approach. The policy based distributed operation of ABE conforms well to the blockchain concept. The cross-chain PoP approach provides the benefits from both public blockchains and private blockchains. Businesses will be able to restrict access, maintain privacy, and improve performance while still being able to leverage the distributed trust of public blockchains. This paper present the ABE-based security framework and protocol for securing data, transactions as well as smart contracts. Security analysis and performance evaluation show the proposed solution to be effective, efficient and practical. It can greatly reduce the cost and complexity for businesses compared to running isolated private blockchain solutions.

AB With the rapid development of medical information services, the construction of intelligent hospitals is opening up a new mode of medical treatment in the health care industry. Medical data is gradually becoming more and more important, while it also faces some challenges, among which the most urgent problem to be solved is data security and privacy protection. In the construction of intelligent hospitals, the safety issues among the basic information of patients, the protection of medical information and inter-institutional information sharing have become the focus at this stage. Blockchain technology, with highly security, reliable architecture and algorithm design have operated stably in the financial industry for more than seven years. The related innovative technologies such as distributed ledgers, smart contracts, symmetric encryptions and consensus mechanisms are used widely in many fields. This paper will take the demonstration construction of Chongqing Intelligent Hospital as an example, which tries to combine the blockchain, homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proof technology to carry out the research on the security construction and data privacy protection of intelligent hospitals.

SO ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB This article has developed a structural equation model, aimed at evaluating the impact factors on people?s holding intention of Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency created by the Blockchain technology. Specifically, this study directs its attention on the Bitcoin holder's perceived value and risk, the moderating effects of gender, income, age, and the experience of digital token provided by the respondents. The conclusions are: (1) The majority of individuals do not have any understanding of the values or risks of Bitcoin; (2) The more transaction and speculative risks of Bitcoin people perceive, the less government intervention they are expected to have. Nevertheless, even if government intervention is necessary, it would not impact their holding intention; (3) The higher value of Bitcoin people perceive, the more government intervention people would prefer. Despite this preference, people's holding intention remains intact. However, its degree of influence is definitely less conspicuous than the above effect of the second conclusion; and (4) The government advocacy about the values and risks of Bitcoin should be differentiated by the more nuanced factors such as gender, income, the experience of digital token usage, and age of users, in order to obtain an effective regulation of Bitcoin.

TI Smart Contract Security: A Software Lifecycle Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Smart contract security is an emerging research area that deals with security issues arising from the execution of smart contracts in a blockchain system. Generally, a smart contract is a piece of executable code that automatically runs on the blockchain to enforce an agreement preset between parties involved in the transaction. As an innovative technology, smart contracts have been applied in various business areas, such as digital asset exchange, supply chains, crowdfunding, and intellectual property. Unfortunately, many security issues in smart contracts have been reported in the media, often leading to substantial financial losses. These security issues pose new challenges to security research because the execution environment of smart contracts is based on blockchain computing and its decentralized nature of execution. Thus far, many partial solutions have been proposed to address specific aspects of these security issues, and the trend is to develop new methods and tools to automatically detect common security vulnerabilities. However, smart contract security is systematic engineering that should be explored from a global perspective, and a comprehensive study of issues in smart contract security is urgently needed. To this end, we conduct a literature review of smart contract security from a software lifecycle perspective. We first analyze the key features of blockchain that can cause security issues in smart contracts and then summarize the common security vulnerabilities of smart contracts. To address these vulnerabilities, we examine recent advances in smart contract security spanning four development phases: 1) security design; 2) security implementation; 3) testing before deployment; and 4) monitoring and analysis. Finally, we outline emerging challenges and opportunities in smart contract security for blockchain engineers and researchers.

AB Can cryptocurrency mining (crypto-mining) be a practical ad-free monetization approach for mobile app developers? We conducted a lab experiment and a user study with 228 real Android users to investigate different aspects of mobile crypto-mining. In particular, we show that mobile devices have computational resources to spare and that these can be utilized for crypto-mining with minimal impact on the mobile user experience. We also examined the profitability of mobile crypto-mining and its stability as compared to mobile advertising. In many cases, the profit of mining can exceed mobile advertising's. Most importantly, our study shows that the majority (72%) of the participants are willing to allow crypto-mining as means to replace ads to trade-off for benefits such as a better user experience.

Unfortunately, this allows attackers to execute exploitation techniques into these architectures. In addition, ransomware insertion is nowadays the most popular attacking vector because it denies the availability of critical files and systems until attackers receive the demanded ransom. In this paper, it is analysed the risk impact of ransomware insertion into SCADA systems and it is suggested countermeasures addressed to the protection of SCADA systems and its components to reduce the impact of ransomware insertion.

AB Efficient and reliable propagation of blocks is vital for ensuring the scalability of the Bitcoin network. As a result, several schemes have been proposed over the last few years to speed up the block propagation, most notably the compact block protocol (BIP 152). Despite this, we show experimental evidence that (i) the vast majority (97%) of Bitcoin nodes exhibit intermittent network connectivity (churn), and (ii) this churn results in significant numbers of unsuccessful compact blocks, roughly twice the figure for continuously connected nodes. Specifically, we conduct experiments on the Bitcoin network that show that churn results in a 135% average increase in block propagation time (i.e., 336.57 ms vs 142.62 ms), and can lead to as high as an 800-fold increase in the worst case. To effect our analysis, we develop a statistical model for churn based on empirical network data, and use this model to actuate the live test nodes on the Bitcoin network. The performance of the system is measured by means of a novel framework that we develop for logging the internal behavior of a Bitcoin node and share for public use.

AB Detection of software bottlenecks which hinder utilizing hardware resources is a classic but complex problem due to the layered structures of the software bottlenecks. However, model-based approaches require a performance model given, which is impractical to maintain under today's agile development environment, and profile-based approaches do not handle the layered structures of the software bottlenecks.
   This paper proposes a novel approach of taking the best of both worlds which extracts a performance model from execution profiles of the target application to detect the layered bottlenecks. We collect a wake-up profile of threads, which samples an event that one thread wakes up another thread, and build a thread dependency graph to detect the layered bottlenecks.
   We implement our approach of profile-based detection of layered bottlenecks in the Go programming language. We demonstrate that our method can detect software bottlenecks limiting scalability and throughput of state-of-the-art middleware such as a web application server and a permissioned blockchain network, with small amount of the runtime overhead for profile collection.

AB Although the blockchain-based applications are considered to be less vulnerable due to the nature of the distributed ledger, they did not become the silver bullet with respect to securing the information against different security risks. In this paper, we present a literature review on the security risks that can be mitigated by introducing the blockchain technology, and on the security risks that are identified in the blockchain-based applications. In addition, we highlight the application and technology domains where these security risks are observed. The results of this study could be seen as a preliminary checklist of security risks when implementing blockchain-based applications.

TI BUS: A Blockchain-Enabled Data Acquisition Scheme With the Assistance of
   UAV Swarm in Internet of Things
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper presents a blockchain enabled secure data acquisition scheme utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm where data are collected from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and subsequently, forwarded to the nearest server through the UAV swarm. Before initiating data acquisition, the UAV swarm shares a shared key with the IoT devices in order to maintain communications. However, prior to transmitting data, the IoT devices encrypt the data and forward it to the UAV swarm. Upon receiving the data, the UAV swarm implements a two-phase validation utilizing the pi-hash bloom filter and the digital signature algorithm to validate the sender; in addition, prior to forwarding data to the nearest server, it performs encryption. However, before adding data in blockchain, consent from all validators is required. Finally, the data are stored in blockchain with the approval of validators. A security analysis is performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is manifested through the implementation and simulation. The security analysis and the performance results show that UAV assist the IoT devices both in terms of connectivity and energy consumption, and provides security against the threats mentioned in the paper.

TI Lightweight Blockchain for Healthcare
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Healthcare data management has been gaining a lot of attention in recent years because of its high potential to provide more accurate and cost-efficient patient care. The traditional client-server and cloud-based healthcare data management systems suffer from the issues of single point of failure, data privacy, centralized data stewardship, and system vulnerability. The replication mechanism, and privacy and security features of blockchain have a promising future in the healthcare domain as they can solve some of the inherent issues of the health management system. However, most of the recent research works on blockchain in the healthcare domain have primarily focused on the permission-less Bitcoin network that suffers from drawbacks such as high energy consumption, limited scalability, and low transaction throughput. Consequently, there is a need for a scalable, fault-tolerant, secure, traceable and private blockchain to suit the requirements of the healthcare domain. We propose a lightweight blockchain architecture for the healthcare data management that reduces the computational and communication overhead compared to the Bitcoin network by dividing the network participants into clusters and maintaining one copy of the ledger per cluster. Our architecture introduces the use of canal, that allows secure and confidential transactions within a group of network participants. Furthermore, we propose a solution to avoid forking which is prevalent in the Bitcoin network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture in providing security and privacy compared to the Bitcoin network by analyzing different threats and attacks. We also discuss how our proposed architecture addresses the identified threats. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture generates 11 times lower network traffic compared to the Bitcoin network as the number of blocks increases. Our ledger update is 1.13 times faster. Our architecture shows a speedup of 67 in ledger update and 10 times lower network traffic when the number of nodes increases.

AB In this paper we unpack empirical data from two domains within the Blockchain information infrastructure: The cryptocurrency trading domain, and the energy domain. Through these accounts we introduce the relational concepts of Blockchain Assemblages and Whiteboxing. Blockchain assemblages comprise configurations of digital and analogue artefacts that are entangled with imaginaries about the current and future state of the Blockchain information infrastructure. Rather than being a black box, Blockchain assemblages alternate between being dynamic and stable entities. We propose Whiteboxing as the sociomaterial process which drives blockchain assemblages in their dynamic state to be (re)configured, while related artefacts and imaginaries are simultaneously transformed, creating dynamic representations. Whiteboxing is triggered during disconfirming events when representations are discovered as problematic. Complementing existing historical accounts demonstrating technologies in the making, the contribution of this paper, proposes whiteboxing as an analytical concept which allows us to unpack how contemporary technologies are created through entrepreneurial activities.

AB Prior to blockchain technology coming into much usage, the earlier cryptographic digital cash schemes relied merely on trusted authorities. Bitcoin revolutionized this conventional view of a cryptocurrency, trading decentralized, distributed ledger, completely secured by the majority rule without predetermined authority or owner. Only standard cryptographic primitives such as signatures and hash functions were used to achieve security. Though other cryptocurrencies such as Bit-gold and B-money which are among the authority free cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the first one to experience public acceptance on a large scale. There are various factors which contribute to Bitcoins success, though there is still a little question of doubt that the decentralized design of blockchain technology and perceived resilience to government or third-party intervention played an extremely crucial role in its uptake. Distributed crypto cash, more specifically in Blockchain technology has hailed as one key and most eminent and widely accepted innovation of Bitcoin. In this paper we have worked on the use of blockchain technology to implement cryptocurrency for IOT.

AB The development of Internet of Things (IoT) has paved way for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are indispensable for ITS with intelligent vehicles (IV) as their key players. To ensure proper and reliable VANET operation, IVs need secure inter-and intra-network communication with trust and reliability of data (provenance). This paper aims to provide trust management in VANETs by proposing a trustless system model using blockchain and a certificate authority (CA) for registering IVs as well as revoking their registration if need be. Furthermore, to preserve data reliability, this paper uses physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Implementation of DrivMan shows that it is able to establish distributed trust management and enables secure data sharing while preserving the privacy of IVs.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is quickly growing with a wide range of current and planned future applications. As the technology grows in usage, the data gathered by UAV systems as well as the UAVs themselves will become bigger targets for cyber-attacks. New cyber security technologies, such as the immutable ledger technology known as blockchain, should therefore be applied to provide a defense against the growing threat of cyber-attacks. This paper explores blockchain technology, first through a general overview of its components and characteristics, and then at what security improvements it can provide to a system. Following this exploration, the application of blockchain to a UAV swarm environment is briefly expanded on. Lastly, one such blockchain framework known as Hyperledger Fabric is explored, that could potentially be applied to a swarm of UAVs to increase its security.

The metadata of the video is recorded on the distributed ledger of the blockchain, thereby blocking the possibility of forgery of the data. The proposed architecture encrypts and stores the video, creates a license within the blockchain, and exports the video. Since the decryption key for the video is managed by the private DB of the blockchain, it is not leaked by the internal manager unauthorizedly. In addition, the internal administrator can manage and export videos safely by exporting the license generated in the blockchain to the DRM-applied video player.

AB Outsourcing storage and computation to clouds is popular but also raises security concerns. Most existing solutions mainly focus on an honest-but-curious cloud server, while security designs against a malicious server have not drawn enough attention. Although there are a few works addressing the issue of verifiable designs that enable the data owner to verify the integrity of search results. Unfortunately, these verification schemes are not efficient and or applicable from one scenario to another. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a publicly verifiable search framework for outsourced encrypted data based on blockchain. In our framework, we store the encrypted index in a decentralized blockchain (Ethereum) while outsourcing the corresponding encrypted data to the cloud or Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Thus, once a user is authorized, he/she can get the query results and check the query integrity efficiently by the designed smart contract anytime without data owner being online. Besides, to guarantee the privacy of the data user in the Ethereum, we construct a stealth authorization scheme to achieve access authorization delivery. The security analysis and performance evaluation show that the proposed scheme is secure and practical for verification of encrypted data.

Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance protocol (PBFT) proposed by Castro and Liskov in 1999 is recognized as the most classic protocol for solving the Byzantine generals problem, but it still has many fatal disadvantages. Firstly, its communication complexity in the consensus process has reached O(n(2)), so that it can only be applied in a small-scale system. Secondly, it works in a completely enclosed environment, nodes are not allowed to participate or exit the network without restarting the system, making it difficult to get applied in the actual system. In order to solve these problem, this paper proposes the High Performance and Scalable Byzantine Fault Tolerance, an improved BFT protocol, called HSBFT. In normal case operation, the HSBFT's communication complexity is reduced to O(n), and it also has the ability to be scalable, making it adaptable to more diverse practical scenarios.

AB With the development of Blockchain, more and more distributed cryptocurrencies continue to emerge. Most of these currencies use cryptographic techniques (such as zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, etc.) to enhance privacy protection, but at the same time the regulatory authorities have no access to audit transactions. Most existing auditing schemes are based on centralized system and cannot be directly applied to distributed cryptocurrencies. Therefore, an Auditable Zerocoin with User Awareness (AZUA) scheme which supports privacy protection and auditability simultaneously is proposed in this paper. Aiming to ensure that auditors can audit Zerocoin's transactions, auditability is defined in this paper. Meanwhile, in order to prevent auditors from abusing their power, a new security property is proposed: user awareness auditing. Moreover, taking transaction privacy issue into consideration, indistinguishability of audit information is defined. The transaction auditing from auditors is achieved in AZUA through the encryption scheme, which ensures the honesty of the auditors by introducing a commitment mechanism and that the users can be aware of whether they have been audited according to randomized public keys. Finally, it is proved that the scheme can satisfy auditability, user awareness auditing and indistinguishability of audit information simultaneously.

AB With the increasing popularity of online shopping, privacy concerns in E-commerce are attracting more and more attention. Existing E-commerce models are trapped in a dilemma between the proof of ownership and privacy protection. To address this issue, in this paper we design a privacy-preserving business protocol by employing private smart contracts in the negotiation phase. The protocol allows counterparties make deals without the disclosure of private information such as identities, addresses, and phone numbers. Moreover, we employ the zero-knowledge proof to guarantee the ownership. To understand the feasibility for implementing the proposed model, we also conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum Quorum and SERO.

TI Charging Guiding Strategy for Electric Taxis Based on Consortium
   Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The issues in charging guiding for electric vehicles are meaningful studies in recent years, especially for electric taxis which need to be recharged during working hours. However, with the popularity of taxi-booking apps, how to obtain an effective charging guiding for taxis having advance orders becomes an urgent problem to be solved. To optimize various special interests while satisfying the constraints of online advance orders, a charging guiding strategy based on consortium blockchain is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a taxi charging guiding architecture based on consortium blockchain is designed, and an improved practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of charging information disconnection and trust between multiple charging station operators. Secondly, we establish the charging guiding model for electric taxis based on multi-objective optimization. The model aims to meet the constraints of online advance orders, maximize passengers' satisfaction and operators' service efficiency, and minimize the charging costs of taxis. Finally, the optimization model is solved by quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed guiding strategy, main urban areas of a city are taken as examples for simulation. The results show that the proposed strategy has increased the passengers' satisfaction by 0.44%, and has decreased the expense cost, the time cost and distance cost by 2.38%, 5.72%, and 17.25% respectively, comparing with PSO based strategy while balancing the utilization of charging equipment.

AB Demand reduction, also known as Negawatts or negative watts, has emerged as another commodity that can be exchanged. This paper discusses conceptual architecture of a blockchain-based negawatt trading platform implemented on Hyperledger. Two trading scenarios are discussed. The first scenario involves negawatt trading between a demand response aggregator and buildings. The second scenario discusses negawatt trading among buildings to meet the contract shortfalls of buildings in the first scenario. Participants, assets, transactions and transaction flows of both scenarios are described, together with the smart contracts that describe how buyers and sellers are compensated for their negawatt exchange. Case studies are implemented and compared.

AB Multimedia data, especially images are increasing dramatically. Images published on the Web are more often facing the risk of being tampered or manipulated since their content is easily mutable. Using blockchain technology provides advantages and, at the same time, challenges when dealing with this issue due to the following reasons: (a) data in a blockchain are well saved and immutable and (b) adding the data directly to a blockchain may consume much time which makes it computationally and economically expensive. Thus, we propose a blockchain-based solution which considers two key aspects: First, using a blockchain to register information about ownership and copyrights for authors, as well as descriptive information of an image, used to detect copyright violations. Second, avoiding insertion of raw image data into the blockchain, but storing only unique descriptive metadata about the images, allowing for a more efficient implementation of the system. This work considers different well-known image matching approaches to validate the power of the proposed approach, which allows for an efficient checking of violations of copyrights for a given image.

TI Blockchain-Driven on-Demand Control Loops Over Iot Environments
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The feedback control loop is the atomic unit in a control system. Typically, feedback control loops are rigid objects that involve a dynamical system, or plant, which has a set of its output states measured by dedicated sensors, which in turn feed a processing unit, known as controller, that calculates actions to be applied as inputs to the plant, via elements known as actuators, in order to drive the outputs to a desired value or trajectory. The appearance of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, where a large number of sensors and processing units interact over a communication network, offers an underlying infrastructure to operate and configure control loops using a different logic: an on-demand strategy. This work introduces the concept of on-demand control loop, and proposes the use of blockchain technology as the enabling infrastructure for generating on-demand control loops over large-scale IoT environments. General design guidelines are given and a simple implementation example over the Ethereum blockchain is presented, which shows the feasibility of the proposed technique.

TI Health Data in Dentistry: An Attempt to Master the Digital Challenge
SO PUBLIC HEALTH GENOMICS
AB Background: Biomedical research has recently moved through three stages in digital healthcare: (1) data collection; (2) data sharing; and (3) data analytics. With the explosion of stored health data (HD), dental medicine is edging into its fourth stage of digitization using artificial intelligence (AI). This narrative literature review outlines the challenge of managing HD and anticipating the potential of AI in oral healthcare and dental research by summarizing the current literature. Summary: The basis of successful management of HD is the establishment of a generally accepted data standard that will guide its implementation within electronic health records (EHR) and health information technology ecosystems (HIT Eco). Thereby continuously adapted (self-) learning health systems (LHS) can be created. The HIT Eco of the future will combine (i) the front-end utilization of HD in clinical decision-making by providers using supportive diagnostic tools for patient-centered treatment planning, and (ii) back-end algorithms analyzing the standardized collected data to inform population-based policy decisions about resource allocations and research directions. Cryptographic methods in blockchain enable a safe, more efficient, and effective dental care within a global perspective. Key Message: The interoperability of HD with accessible digital health technologies is the key to deliver value-based dental care and exploit the tremendous potential of AI.

AB The digital currency Bitcoin has had remarkable growth since it was first proposed in 2008. Its distributed nature allows currency transactions without a central authority by using cryptographic methods and a data structure called the blockchain. Imagine that you could run the Bitcoin protocol on a quantum computer. What advantages can be had over classical Bitcoin? This is the question we answer here by introducing Quantum Bitcoin which, among other features, has immediate local verification of transactions. This is a major improvement over classical Bitcoin since we no longer need the computationally-intensive and time-consuming method of recording all transactions in the blockchain. Quantum Bitcoin is the first distributed quantum currency, and this paper introduces the necessary tools including a novel two-stage quantum mining process. In addition, we have counterfeiting resistance, fully anonymous and free transactions, and a smaller footprint than classical Bitcoin.
   In this paper we construct Quantum Bitcoin, a novel currency that draws its inspiration from both Bitcoin and quantum mechanics. As we later show, our new currency has several interesting advantages over existing payment systems, although the drawback is that it requires a quantum computer to function.

TI Bitcoin and Venezuela's Unofficial Exchange Rate
SO LEDGER
AB Using Bitcoin trading data in Venezuelan bolivars from the Local Bitcoins peer-to-peer market place and using the theory of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), Bitcoin, as a single universal asset, is substituted for the 'basket of goods' normally used in the PPP, allowing the estimation of the relationship between the Venezuelan bolivar and the United States dollar. In this analysis Bitcoin is used as a tool to enable the calculation of the bolivars to dollars unofficial exchange rate and consequently the implied inflation rate. Using Bitcoin's publicly available prices in this way enables a government's economic mismanagement to be identified more quickly than the typical approach of measuring changes in the Consumer Price Index. Venezuela is currently in crisis, which this approach identifies as a problem as far back as 2014, as official and unofficial exchange rates diverge and inflation rates increase yearly reaching an unbelievable 70,000% in 2018 alone.

AB The proliferation of the Internet of Things has seen it adopted to practically all aspects of life. There has been an increase in demand for more IoT devices which are manufactured by several companies. This has however left need to address vulnerabilities within and threats to these devices. In many cases, these vulnerabilities arise from manufacturer focus on functionality rather than security. Secure by design IoT devices are rare in the market today. Efforts to address this are being made by the IoT research community, however, more effort is required. Deficiencies of current efforts include accountability of devices and privacy of data generated across the IoT landscape. The aim of this Ph.D. research is to improve the security, privacy, veracity, and trust. The approach developed in this study will be based on non-repudiation of actions among self-organized IoT devices in an IoT Ecosystem by leveraging Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). A proposed system architecture which relies on the Distributed Ledger Technology and its related features will enable services to be applied to the IoT landscape to achieve aspects of end to end IoT security. The initial progress to date is presented within this manuscript.

   to Reduce Economic Conflicts
SO UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS: PREREQUISITES FOR THE
   DEVELOPMENT OF ICT
SE Studies in Computational Intelligence
AB The article was prepared for the purpose of scientific substantiation of the need for a systemic reduction of conflict among economic agents through a preventive-prophylactic approach. To achieve this target, the authors, developing the content of the article, methodologically rely on the materialistic, positivistic world outlook, apply a number of general scientific, special scientific and special methods. The conflict nature of economic activity, expressed in legal disputes of economic entities, adversely affects the economic dynamics in general, forever breaks the established economic and contractual relations between them, in particular. Quite often, litigations arise between business entities due to the unequal understanding by the parties of the sequence, timing and amount of fulfillment of their obligations regarding the supply of goods, the performance of work, the provision of services, and the exercise of property rights. And also because of the different interpretations of those documents that the parties draw up in the execution of transactions. Huge material and time resources are spent on proving one or another circumstance, on upholding one or another position arising from the interpretation by the party of its specific obligations under the transaction. The preventive-prophylactic approach provides for the initial reduction of potentially conflicting points in the implementation of bilateral relations through electronic registration of the facts of the activities of economic entities themselves, which after such registration are considered identically understood and recognized by the parties, are considered proven and cannot be disputed. It is discussed that it is necessary to do this, both at the stage of concluding a bilateral agreement and further, successively in the stages of the fulfillment of obligations by each party. As a result, the number of potentially conflicting moments that could arise in economic contractual relations decreases in the process of interaction between the parties and tends to zero by the deadline for the transaction. Technically preventive-prophylactic approach to reducing the conflict of economic activities involves the continuous maintenance of a distributed register of electronic registration of facts of economic and contractual relations by several public entities and the parties themselves. The specified distributed registry is legally valid at the national level, the database on registration of facts of economic and contractual relations is duplicated and stored on servers of a number of judicial and executive authorities. The facts of economic and contractual relations for specific transactions that are electronically registered in the specified distributed registry are not subject to dispute. As a result, business entities initially have an extremely narrow field for mutual misunderstanding and for litigation on certain issues of economic activity, the potential for conflict in their contractual relationships is reduced.

TI Light-Weight Security and Blockchain Based Provenance for Advanced
   Metering Infrastructure
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The protection of smart meters (SMs) from cyberattacks is of utmost importance because SMs in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) are physically unprotected and produce a large amount of sensitive data. Due to scalability, the SMs are small-sized and low-cost devices having low computational capabilities. The algorithms that are designed to complete the security requirements of SMs should be lightweight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight security solution to address the manin-the-middle attack, data tempering, and blockchain-based data provenance. Received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is used to generate link fingerprints, which are used along with pseudo-random nonce to secure AMI. The proposed algorithm detects the involvement of adversarial node or meter tempering by computing other values along with 0 and 1 as the average of consecutive RSSI and difference between the RSSI of connected static SMs. Pearson correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.9102 is achieved when no adversarial node is present in between the connected SMs having mobility in one or both SMs. Negative or approximately equal to zero values of rho are computed when the adversary is present in the AMI or any of the SM in the AMI is forged. For blockchain-based data provenance, all the hash values of the packet header are 100% matched with the hash functions present at the data concentrator unit (DCU), which shows no adversary's involvement in AMI. For cases when the adversary is in the AMI, hash functions show no match with the hash values present at the DCU.

AB This research is aimed at identifying certain issues concerning consumers and protection of their rights in the field of the Internet of things. In addition to raised issues, the authors suggest possible solutions to them. The authors are interested in the legal aspect of consumer rights protection in the space of the Internet of things. The authors are aware of the fact that the Internet of things is the union and relation of things through the Internet; it is obvious however that these things are only interrelated under the facilitation of a human and for his/her purposes. The authors analyze the interaction of persons in the space of the Internet of things, in which things "interact" with other persons (non-owners of things) for satisfaction of needs of the owners of things. It has been alleged that statutory regulation of consumer rights protection in the field of the Internet of things is almost entirely absent; available national and international regulatory acts and individual standards are not adapted to regulation of relations in the field of the Internet of things. The basic concept of "consumer" has no standard definition so far. The authors have suggested ways to identify the users of the Internet of things. The concept of vulnerable consumer is taken into consideration. The analysis of neutrality of the Internet of things and its relation to unfair discrimination of consumers is performed. Certain issues of consumer rights protection are studied through the prism of smart contracts; in particular, the issues of consumers' withdrawal from smart contracts are analyzed. Since the Internet of things is mostly cross-border in nature, definitions which are used in the field of the Internet of things, as well as attributions of responsibility and sanctions for violations must be uniform and intersectoral within the framework of national and international legislation. General scientific methods of scientific cognition (analysis, synthesis) and the method of comparative legal studies were used in this paper.

AB The blockchain technology has been changing our daily lives since Bitcoin-i.e., the first decentralized cryptocurrency-was invented and released as open-source software by an unidentified person or a group called Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Of many applications which can be implemented based on the blockchain, storage is an important one, a notable example of which is the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). IPFS is a distributed web based on a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open and focuses on public accessible files. To provide a solution for private file storage in the blockchain way, in this paper we propose a Merkle-tree-based File System (MTFS). In MTFS, the blockchain is more than a trust machine; it is an abstract of a cluster system. Distributed random nodes form a tree network cluster without a central controller to provide a secure private storage service and faster message propagation. Advance proxy re-encryption algorithm is applied to guarantee secure file exchanges under permission. Merkle tree will make sure that the files are distributed among the service nodes in a balanced way. The proposed MTFS can be used not only for personal file storage and exchange but also for industry requiring mutual trust in file uploading and downloading in making contracts like insurances.

AB The electronic authentication system authenticates the documents electronically using the blockchain technology, which enables us to implement an integrated system of official documents of all kinds for Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan. This technology allows us to build a robust database system that cannot be tampered with, modified, destroyed or altered. It further ensures the safety of documents issued within the University departments and those exported or deported outside the University system; such as, financial documents, official documents and academic certificates. Moreover, this system guarantees us a very high level of data and information security and confidentiality. Our system will be built using a database that provides 100% true information about the exports of that system. This technology will help users prevent the forgery of the data and official documents issued by the University of Al-Zaytoonah, both internally and externally, and also enables the departments within the University to issue documents to third parties while ensuring confirmed, undeniable delivery and sound content.

AB Advancement in communication technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving smart cities adoption that aims to increase operational efficiency and improve the quality of services and citizen welfare. It is estimated that by 2020, 75% of cars shipped globally will be equipped with hardware to facilitate vehicle connectivity. The privacy, reliability and integrity of communication must be ensured so that actions can be accurate and implemented promptly after receiving actionable information. Because vehicles are equipped with the ability to compute, communicate, and sense their environment, there is a concomitant critical need to create and maintain trust among network entities in the context of the network's dynamism, an issue that requires building and validating the trust between entities in a small amount of time before entities leave each other's range. In this work, we present a multi -tier scheme consisting of an authentication and trust building/distribution framework designed to ensure the safety and validity of the information exchanged in the system.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency whose transactions are recorded in a common ledger, so called blockchain. Due to the anonymity and lack of law enforcement, Bitcoin has been misused in darknet markets which deal with illegal products, such as drugs and weapons. Therefore from the security forensics aspect, it is demanded to establish an approach to identify newly emerged darknet markets' transactions and addresses. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze Bitcoin transactions and addresses related to darknet markets and propose a novel identification method of darknet markets' addresses. To improve the identification performance, we propose a voting based method which decides the labels of multiple addresses controlled by the same user based on the number of the majority label. Through the computer simulation with more than 200K Bitcoin addresses, it was shown that our voting based method outperforms the nonvoting based one in terms of precision, recal, and F1 score. We also found that DNM's addresses pay higher fees than others, which significantly improves the classification.

AB The burgeoning vehicular networks generate a huge amount of sensing data. Data sharing among vehicles enables a number of valuable vehicular applications to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. To ensure security and traceability of data sharing, an efficient Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm is utilized to establish Blockchain-Enabled VEhicular Networks (BEVENs). Miners in DPoS include active miners and standby miners. The active miners are responsible for block generation and block verification. However, due to the limited number of active miners in DPoS, the compromised active miners may collude with each other to generate maliciously manipulated results of block verification. To prevent the internal collusion among the active miners, a newly generated block can be further verified and audited by the standby miners. To incentivize the participation of the miners in block verification, we adopt the contract theory to model the interactions between active miners and standby miners, where both block verification security and delay are taken into consideration. Numerical results demonstrate the security and efficiency of our schemes for data sharing in BEVENs.

AB Even though a token economy is the core part of a blockchain-based project, it is still in the early stage of academic exploration. Moreover, recent projects adopt multi-token economies to encourage the participants to stay longer in their economic systems, which are more complicated than single token economies. This paper addresses the token classification, the reason for adopting multi-token economies and the effectiveness of them. We analyze the Steemit as a representative example of multi-token economies. We describe how the multi-token economy has been working and show the distinctive features of multi-token economies. We also propose the evaluation criteria for multi-token economies.

TI Robotic Services for New Paradigm Smart Cities Based on Decentralized
   Technologies
SO LEDGER
AB This article describes different methods of organizing robotic services for smart cities using secure encrypted decentralized technologies and market mechanisms-as opposed to models based on centralized solutions based (or not) on using cloud services and stripping citizens of the control of their own data. The basis of the proposed methods is the Ethereum decentralized computer with the mechanism of smart contracts. In this work, special attention is paid to the integration of technical and economic information into one network of transactions, which allows creating a unified way of interaction between robots- the robot economy. Three possible scenarios of robotic services for smart cities based on the economy of robots are presented: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), environmental monitoring, and smart factories. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scenarios, three experiments are presented and discussed. Our work shows that the Ethereum network can provide, through smart contracts and their ability to activate programs to interact with the physical world, an effective and practical way to manage robot services for smart cities.

AB Distributed storage systems (DSS) have a potential of storing big amounts of data. Specialized DSS codes were defined with the main idea to enhance the reliability, availability, maintenance and data security in DSS systems. In this paper, we establish a new way of communication, named Distributed Communication Channel (DCC), that uses the coding mechanism that is similar to the one applied in the DSS. DCC represents a communication channel between two or more parties, that exchange information through multiple physical channels. It adapts the DSS concept using the benefits established with respect to the communication reliability and security against intruders and attacks. Moreover, with this concept we offer an increased security using the recent developments used in the Blockchain technology. The blockchain is used as a tool to securely bypass the transformation matrix or the exchange of encryption keys, between the sender and the receiver in the communication channel. The whole system uses the so-called spatial spreading mechanism to transfer the data through independent channels. Therefore, it is more reliable and secure, than the basic systems using the DSS algorithm.

TI Blockchain governance
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES
AB Blockchain is probably best known as a technology that underpins bitcoin cryptocurrency, taking records (e.g., confirmed financial transactions) and placing them into 'blocks', which are linked to prior blocks - forming a chronological 'chain' of blocks. However, bitcoin blockchain is only one instantiation of blockchain technology and there exist a few qualitative analyses addressing instantiations of blockchain technology. The aim of this study was two-fold: 1) to understand the difference between bitcoin and blockchain; 2) to delineate the need (and role) of governance in blockchain technology. First, fundamental relationships (and differences) between bitcoin and blockchain are presented. Second, drawing on societal blockchain technology concerns, a key element (i.e., governance) and its role in shaping blockchain technology is suggested. This research concludes with possible areas of research (and research questions) that can enable realisation of blockchain governance along the areas philosophical, theoretical, axiological, methodological, axiomatic, method and application dimensions.

AB With the increasing development of advanced communication technologies, vehicles are becoming smarter and more connected. Due to the tremendous growth of various vehicular applications, a huge amount of data is generated through advanced on-board devices and is deemed critical to improve driving safety and enhance vehicular services. However, cloud based models often fall short in applications where latency and mobility are critical. In order to fully realize the potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication and computation need to be addressed. In this direction, vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged which extends the concept of fog computing to conventional vehicular networks. It is a geographically distributed paradigm that has the potential to conduct time-critical and data-intensive tasks by pushing intelligence (i.e. computing resources, storage, and application services) in the vicinity of end vehicles. However secure and reliable transmission are of significant importance in highly-mobile vehicular networks in order to ensure the optimal Quality of Service (QoS). In this direction, several authentication mechanisms have been proposed in the literature but most of them are found unfit due to absence of decentralization, anonymity, and trust characteristics. Thus, an effective cross-datacenter authentication and key-exchange scheme based on blockchain and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed in this paper. Here, the distributed ledger of blockchain is used for maintaining the network information while the highly secure ECC is employed for mutual authentication between vehicles and road side units (RSUs). Additionally, the proposed scheme is lightweight and scalable for the considered VFC setup. The performance evaluation results against the existing state-of-the-art reveal that the proposed scheme accomplishes enhanced security features with reduced computational and communicational overheads. Further, its extensive evaluation on the widely applicable Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool guarantee its safeness against different attack vectors.

AB A Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) is a self-organized network, formed by vehicles and some fixed equipment on roads called Roads Side Units (RSUs). Vehicular communications are expected to share different kinds of information between vehicles and infrastructure. Because of these specifications, securing VANET constitutes a difficult and challenging task that has attracted the interest of many researchers. In a previous work, we proposed a Clustering Mechanism for VANET (CMV) and its inherit Trust management scheme (TCMV) to ensure security of communication among vehicles. CMV organizes vehicles into clusters and elected Cluster Heads (CHs), and allows the clusters maintenance while dealing with velocity. On the other side, TCMV computes the credibility of the message by CH using the reputation of vehicles. However, we found that the value of credibility of the message by CH is not enough to verify if an exchanged message is correct or no. In order to provide a secured vehicle communication and to build reliance communication among vehicles, we propose a distributive trust management scheme for VANET to verify the correctness of the message based on the controlling of the vehicle'behavior by a miner and the credibility of message by a CH.

AB Cyber-attacks have become more sophisticated over recent years with the different configuration types and various industry sectors have suffered from a range of these different attack vectors resulting in some devastating outcomes. These have manifested in the shape of ransomware, malware, manipulation methods, phishing and spear-phishing. Whilst data breaches are a serious incident, in most organisations, there is a growing concern regarding attacks that are designed to have a more destructive effect such as the Ukraine cyber-attack in 2015 that resulted in a shutdown of the power grid. Or the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017 that caused widespread chaos with healthcare institutions unable to carry out any tasks since access to data/systems was unavailable. These critical national infrastructure (CNI) attacks into sectors such as healthcare cause data breaches/disruptions and are also able to leverage vulnerabilities in the industrial processes containing ICS and SCADA systems. Perhaps the state sponsored cyber-attacks cause the most concern as they tend to be at the more sophisticated level of the spectrum and maximize on amount of potential harm that is delivered. There is growing interest in how to protect CNI besides just using traditional methods such as regular patching, Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems (IDPS), up to date compliance policies, etc., and blockchain can be the mechanism that gives another protection layer to protect mission critical data. Blockchain, a decentralized network, offers the features of immutability, non-tampering, security encryption, auditability, and can be a permissioned type of environment where the set of users are invited and not open for all. Blockchain can complement these traditional systems by offering another layer of protection to the sensitive and mission critical data.

TI Decentralized Distribution of PCP Mappings Over Blockchain for
   End-to-End Secure Direct Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method that enables devices with private IP addresses to connect to the Internet by sharing a public IP address. Traversing the NAT device remains a challenge for a wide range of applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT). The Port Control Protocol (PCP) is a relatively new protocol standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to solve the NAT traversal issues. It allows a NATed device to request and manage a mapping between its private IP address and transport-layer port to a public IP address and port. As PCP requires an application-dependent method for distributing the mappings to remote hosts, several attacks can target the distributing server and render the communication channel vulnerable. In this paper, we propose and implement a decentralized Blockchain-based approach for distributing PCP-mappings, enabling secure endto-end (e2e) direct communications without any trusted third party server. NATed devices register their PCP mappings and public keys into the Blockchain, and other peers can then learn about these mappings to establish end-to-end secure direct communications. The implementation verifies that the system is feasible in terms of transactions fees, can simplify and secure end-to-end direct communications, and can interwork with conventional security methods.

AB Bitcoin blockchain technology is a distributed ledger of nodes authorizing transactions between anonymous parties. Its key actors are miners using computational power to solve mathematical problems for validating transactions. By sharing blockchain's characteristics, mining is a decentralized, transparent and unregulated practice, less explored in HCI, so we know little about miners' motivations and experiences, and how these may impact on different dimensions of trust. This paper reports on interviews with 20 bitcoin miners about their practices and trust challenges. Findings contribute to HCI theories by extending the exploration of blockchain's characteristics relevant to trust with the competitiveness dimension underpinning the social organization of mining. We discuss the risks of collaborative mining due to centralization and dishonest administrators, and conclude with design implications highlighting the need for tools monitoring the distribution of rewards in collaborative mining, tools tracking data centers' authorization and reputation, and tools supporting the development of decentralized pools.

TI Blockchain-Based Distributive Auction for Relay-Assisted Secure
   Communications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Physical layer security (PLS) is considered as a promising technique to prevent information eavesdropping in wireless systems. In this context, cooperative relaying has emerged as a robust solution for achieving PLS due to multipath diversity and relatively lower transmission power. However, relays or the relay operators in the practical environment are unwilling for service provisioning unless they are incentivized for their cost of services. Thus, it is required to jointly consider network economics and relay cooperation to improve system efficiency. In this paper, we consider the problem of joint network economics and PLS using cooperative relaying and jamming. Based on the double auction theory, we model the interaction between transmitters seeking for a particular level of secure transmission of information and relay operators for suitable relay and jammer assignment, in a multiple source-destination networks. In addition, theoretical analyses are presented to justify that the proposed auction mechanism satisfies the desirable economic properties of individual rationality, budget balance, and truthfulness. As the participants in the traditional centralized auction framework may take selfish actions or collude with each other, we propose a decentralized and trustless auction framework based on blockchain technology. In particular, we exploit the smart contract feature of blockchain to construct a completely autonomous framework, where all the participants are financially enforced by smart contract terms. The security properties of the proposed framework are also discussed.

AB Information Technology has emerged as an integral part of globalization, where it is not only used in e-commerce, e-business and R&D but is also a crucial part of complex data mining used in developing digital currencies and valuating them. These currencies have become popular in the last decade and people around the world have started investing in them, blindly. Even after having high volatility, decentralization and complexity in price determination using cryptograpgy, digital currency has been attracted by many investors who may be trapped by investor biases.. The current paper focuses on exploring the behavioral biases on investment decision making of digital currency/crypto currency by employing qualitative measures and interviewing Pakistani individuals who have purchased crypto currency. It is established from the results that due to complexity of price determination and profit attractiveness, investors become a victim of biases and heuristics when they are investing in digital currencies.

AB In-browser cryptojacking is a form of resource abuse that leverages end-users' machines to mine cryptocurrency without obtaining the users' consent. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate OUTGUARD, an automated cryptojacking detection system. We construct a large ground-truth dataset, extract several features using an instrumented web browser, and ultimately select seven distinctive features that are used to build an SVM classification model. OuTGuARDachieves a 97.9% TPR and 1.1% FPR and is reasonably tolerant to adversarial evasions. We utilized OUTGUARDiR the wild by deploying it across the Alexa Top 1M websites and found 6,302 cryptojacking sites, of which 3,600 are new detections that were absent from the training data. These cryptojacking sites paint a broad picture of the cryptojacking ecosystem, with particular emphasis on the prevalence of cryptojacking websites and the shared infrastructure that provides clues to the operators behind the cryptojacking phenomenon.

AB This paper proposes a cloud based public key infrastructure utilizing blockchain technology model for replacing the currently outdated traditional variant. Environments such as Big Data and IoT ecosystems have scalable and resilient needs that current public key infrastructure cannot satisfy. Enhancements over past models include the use of blockchains to establish persistent access to certificate data and certificate revocation lists. Further improvements made were the decoupling of data from the certificate authority as well as hosting it on a cloud provider in order to tap into traffic security measures of said provider. This results in a smaller viable attack surface for the proposed model. Instead of holding data within the transaction data fields of blocks, certificate data and status were embedded into smart contracts. Our tests revealed a significant performance increase of our proposed model over that of both traditional and the version that stored data within blocks. Storing the certificate data within smart contracts reduced the size of data to be mined which in turn lowered the time to mine said data to 6.6% of the time used for the block data storage method. Also, the mining gas cost per certificate was consequently cut by a significant 87%. In summary, completely decoupling the certificate authority portion of a public key infrastructure and storing certificate data inside smart contracts yields a sizable performance boost while decreasing the attack surface.

AB A cooperative network defense is one approach to fend off large-scale Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. In this regard, the Blockchain Signaling System (BloSS) is a multi-domain, blockchain-based, cooperative DDoS defense system, where each Autonomous System (AS) is taking part in the defense alliance. Each AS can exchange attack information about ongoing attacks via the Ethereum blockchain. However, the currently operational implementation of BloSS is not interactive or visualized, but the DDoS mitigation is automated. In real-world defense systems, a human cybersecurity analyst decides whether a DDoS threat should be mitigated or not. Thus, this work presents the design of a security management dashboard for BloSS, designed for interactive use by cybersecurity analysts.

AB The challenge that journalism is facing these days in the Internet mobile environment is greater than ever before. Journalism is losing its revenue structure to platform operators favoring a certain markets, and also the trust of its readers in light of fake news and infected news. To alleviate this situation, we propose a blockchain technology that is applicable to journalism in order to achieve decentralization as a reasonable alternative. The journalism model based on hybrid blockchain aims to achieve the following: the delivery of articles with sharing value, what we call proof of sharing; the distribution of roles of personalized agenda settings; and finally, the use of agora to collect public opinions. With all these, we attempt to resolve the issues with current journalism with our proposed model based on blockchain.

AB Decentralized ledger has been found in many enterprise applications, such as cross-border transaction processing and supply chain management that multiple companies involved. While enjoying all the benefits of the decentralized ledger technology, there is a burden for each party to maintain its own IT infrastructure to run the decentralized ledger node. Therefore, the concept of blockchain-as-a-service has been proposed where these nodes are kept in the cloud. Blockchain-as-a-service greatly reduces the burden to adopt the decentralized ledger technology but also introduces a new security threat. To mitigate these concerns, we propose an FPGA based decentralized ledger for enterprise applications, which leverages security features of FPGA to prevent unauthorized access to data stored on the ledger without affecting all the desirable features of the decentralized ledger. We also implement the major components and evaluate their cost/performance to demonstrate the practicality.

TI Efficient Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning for Blockchain Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A blockchain as a trustworthy and secure decentralized and distributed network has been emerged for many applications such as in banking, finance, insurance, healthcare and business. Recently, many communities in blockchain networks want to deploy machine learning models to get meaningful knowledge from geographically distributed large-scale data owned by each participant. To run a learning model without data centralization, distributed machine learning (DML) for blockchain networks has been studied. While several works have been proposed, privacy and security have not been sufficiently addressed, and as we show later, there are vulnerabilities in the architecture and limitations in terms of efficiency. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving DML model for a permissioned blockchain to resolve the privacy, security, and performance issues in a systematic way. We develop a differentially private stochastic gradient descent method and an error-based aggregation rule as core primitives. Our model can treat any type of differentially private learning algorithm where non-deterministic functions should be defined. The proposed error-based aggregation rule is effective to prevent attacks by an adversarial node that tries to deteriorate the accuracy of DML models. Our experiment results show that our proposed model provides stronger resilience against adversarial attacks than other aggregation rules under a differentially private scenario. Finally, we show that our proposed model has high usability because it has low computational complexity and low transaction latency.

AB Blockchain which enables decentralization of data based on various consensus mechanisms is considered the leading technology of the next generation. Numerous applications are being proposed to benefit from its immunity against modification and manipulation. However, not many appears as a successful business up to now, except for crypto currencies. High operation cost which is essential for the conventional consensus, is acting as an obstacle to the wide adoption of blockchain applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel blockchain platform based on PoP (Proof of Phone), which lowers the operating cost by imposing high entry cost. We conduct theoretical analysis to show that our proposed platform reduces total cost by up to 98.2% compared to that of conventional blockchain. Our new platform will turn various blockchain applications from theory to practice.

TI Mining Pool Manipulation in Blockchain Network Over Evolutionary Block
   Withholding Attack
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the current blockchain network, many participants rationally migrate the pool to receive a better compensation according to their contribution in situations where the pools they engage encounter undesirable attacks. The Nash equilibria of attacked pool has been widely analyzed, but the analysis of practical methodology for obtaining it is still inadequate. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic analysis of Proof-of-Work (PoW) based blockchain network in order to investigate the mining pool dynamics affected by malicious inflltrators and the feasibility of autonomous migration among individual miners. We formulate a revenue model for mining pools which are implicitly allowed to launch a block withholding attack. Under our mining game, we analyze the evolutionary stability of Nash equilibrium with replicator dynamics, which can explain the population change with time between participated pools. Further, we explore the statistical approximation of successful mining events to show the necessity of artiflcial manipulation for migrating. Finally, we construct a better response learning based on the required block size which can lead to our evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) with numerical results that support our theoretical discoveries.

TI Impacts of Mobility on Performance of Blockchain in VANET
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB This paper investigates how mobility affects the performance of a blockchain system operating in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). The mobility of nodes incurs a unique challenge to a blockchain system due to continuous change and dynamicity in the connectivity of the nodes. Specifically, the mobility makes a proof-of-work (PoW) process difficult since while moving the nodes can only have a limited length of time for a "rendezvous" to exchange a new block for verification. For this reason, accurate modeling for the block exchange behavior in a VANET is also challenging, which nevertheless has not been discussed in previous studies. Therefore, this paper provides an analysis framework that formulates the impact of mobility on a blockchain system's performance in a VANET based on three key metrics: (i) the probability of a successful addition of block to the chain; (ii) the stability of a rendezvous, and; (iii) the number of blocks exchanged during a rendezvous. The closed-form expressions and numerical results display the performance of a blockchain system in various scenarios in a VANET.

TI Two-Phase Cooperative Bargaining Game Approach for Shard-Based
   Blockchain Consensus Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the last few years, blockchain technologies have come to the forefront of the research and industrial communities as they bring potential benefits for many industries. Even though the blockchain is a safe, reliable, and innovative mechanism, current blockchain solutions have fatal drawbacks of non-supervision and huge computational overhead. Therefore, they cannot be directly applied for real world operations. To resolve this problem, a novel model is presented in this study where the key idea is to split the transactions among multiple shards while processing them in parallel. To achieve the maximum system efficiency through the shard mechanism, we focus on the cooperative game theory. Based on the egalitarian bargaining solution, total transactions per each time period are divided for each shard. According to the proportional bargaining solution, assigned transactions in each individual shard are validated by blockchain nodes in a distributed manner. The main advantage of our two-phase bargaining game model is to provide an axiom-based strategic solution for the shard-based consensus problem while dynamically responding to the current blockchain network conditions. The numerical simulation results show that the effectiveness and efficiency of our game based approach by comparing the existing state-of-the-art blockchain control schemes. In the conclusion, we present our conclusions and provide important future research directions based on the combination of blockchain with other technologies.

AB In this paper, we discuss the subnetwork structure of the Blockchain system, which is expected to develop various application platforms in the future. Blockchain is an innovative trading system, and many studies have been conducted recently. It is expected to be used in various fields with stable security function of each node taking part in the system without central server control. However, due to its three functional limitations (excessive traffic generation, lack of distributed control, and unfairness of network resources) presented in this paper, it is difficult to provide complete service in the present network. In order to minimize such problems, a subnetwork structure providing a Blockchain service should provide an appropriate network configuration according to a Blockchain application or service type. In addition, based on the number of the node participated in Blockchain and the amount of data transmitted, it is necessary to provide appropriate QoS and the subnetwork should provide stable protocol function and efficient traffic operation. This subnetwork structure is proposed as a service function of the future network structure of ISO / IEC JTC1 SC6 which is being standardized.

AB A centralized IoT network has a problem of data centralization because data is stored in a center. A blockchain is emerging as a solution to solve the problem in the IoT network by storing blocks to each device. However, lightweight IoT devices cannot store all of the blockchain due to their low storage capacity. We propose storage compression consensus (SCC) algorithm which compresses a blockchain in each device to ensure the storage capacity. When a lightweight device does not have enough storage space, the device processes the SCC to compress the blockchain. We implemented simulations to compare between the SCC and the existing consensus algorithm. As a result, the proposed SCC reduced the storage capacity of stored blockchain by 63% compared to the existing algorithm.

TI ScanAT: Identification of Bytecode-Only Smart Contracts With Multiple
   Attribute Tags
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Smart contracts on blockchain systems implement business logic and directly handle important assets. Although smart contracts play these critical roles, it is hard for users interacting with the system to understand the real behavior of the deployed bytecodes of smart contracts. The quirks of smart contracts, such as code reuse and limited unique datasets, make it challenging to recognize the functional details of smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a new method for characterizing bytecode-only smart contracts by automatically assigning multiple attribute tags. Using a deep learning approach, our system, the ScanAT, extracts attribute tags from the source code and metadata of known smart contracts and trains their bytecode with the attribute tags. The ScanAT then infers attribute tags from the bytecode of smart contracts alone. Our experiments show that ScanAT can achieve 81% accuracy in predicting attribute tags, using convolutional neural networks and a customized autoencoder.

AB Configuration management in networks with highest security demands must not depend on just one administrator and her device. Otherwise, problems can be caused by mistakes or malicious behavior of this admin, or when her computer got compromised, which allows an attacker to abuse the administrator's far-reaching permissions.
   Instead, we propose to use a reliable and resilient configuration management process orchestrated by a configuration management system (CMS). This can be achieved by separation of concerns (proposing a configuration vs. authorizing it), employing multiparty authorization (MPA), and enforcing that only authorized configurations can be deployed. This results in a configuration management process that is decentralized on a human, decision-making level, and a technical, device level.
   However, due to different opinions or adversarial interference, the result of an MPA process can end in a conflict. This raises the question how such conflicts can be mediated in a better way than just employing majority voting, which is insufficient in certain situations. As an alternative, this paper introduces building blocks of customizable conflict mediation strategies which we integrated into our CMS TANCS [1]. The conflict mediation functionality as well as the initial TANCS implementation run on top of the distributed ledger and smart contract framework Hyperledger Fabric which makes all processes resilient and tamper-resistant.

TI MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR INSTITUTIONAL DESIGN
SO TERRA ECONOMICUS
AB Institutional design is a targeted change to the system of socio-economic institutions. This concept is widely used in English-language literature, also sometimes in Russian-language publications. In economics, institutional design processes include the establishment of rules for the use of public resources, the implementation of economic reforms, the creation and reform of economic organizations that significantly affect relations between groups of economic agents, etc. From the many publications in which the processes of institutional design are discussed, the author, using databases such as google scholar, elibrary. ru and search sites, selected for analysis those where the application of mathematical models and calculations takes place. Some of them do not contain the term "institutional design", but contain its synonyms or describe particular cases of its application. This article suggests the classification of mathematical models used in these publications. Among them are econometric models, models of general economic equilibrium, econophysical models involving the application in economics of the methods of the theory of nonlinear dynamic systems, models of game theory (in particular, evolutionary game theory and game theory related to the collective use of resources), and imitation models. Examples of publications about specific types of models are given. The strengths and weaknesses of the use of various types of models and mathematical methods are indicated and the prospects for their use are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the use of information technology in institutional design, which is actively developing due to the presence of the Internet and large computing power, as well as the development and adoption of blockchain technology by society.

TI Taxation of Cryptocurrencies from the Danish and Swedish Perspectives
SO INTERTAX
AB The authors analyse the current classification of cryptocurrencies from the Danish and Swedish domestic income tax perspectives. Cryptocurrencies are analysed as they are typically applied in practice, where a categorization is made between coins, utility tokens, security tokens and asset tokens. In particular, it is concluded that despite the economic differences of different cryptocurrencies, they generally fall outside the scope of Danish and Swedish lex specialis regulation on taxation of capital gains and losses from the sale of certain assets, for example, shares and claims in currency. In both countries, there appears to be a presumption that most cryptocurrencies should be taxed as assets held for investment and speculative purposes. It is argued that such an approach is problematic not only in relation to the principle of neutrality, but also because it creates a barrier to realizing the economic potential of cryptocurrencies. The authors conclude that (1) the classification of cryptocurrencies poses challenges and uncertainty for tax purposes due to the lack of a regulatory framework, the absence of common definitions and the diverse technical structure of tokens and coins and (2) the classification for Danish and Swedish tax law purposes should be based on a case-by-case assessment of the specific cryptocurrency.

The results show that the big exchanges are indeed closely linked one to another. However, the magnitude of spillovers is higher in the case of prices, compared to volume. We also find that the analysed markets react with the same intensity to the price shocks coming from the other markets as to their own shocks. They are, however, more isolated in terms of volume spillovers.

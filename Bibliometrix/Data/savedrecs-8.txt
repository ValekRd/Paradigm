AB In 2008 a group of programmers, alias Satoshi Nakamoto, introduced bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency or virtual money derived from mathematical cryptography and is conceived as an alternative to government authorised currency. The founder anticipated, through bitcoin's construction and his digital mining processes, that bitcoin prices would be relatively stable. However, the recent bitcoin price decline proves that bitcoin is extraordinarily volatile and is not that stable as hoped. Although some scientists have already shown that the fundamental value of bitcoin is zero, the price of bitcoin has reached over 19.000$ in December 2018. Since then, bitcoin prices dropped nearly 70% from their peak value and showed in addition to that the typical trends of a speculative bubble.
   Hyman Minsky and Charles Kindleberger discussed three different patterns of speculative bubbles. One is when price rises in an accelerating way and then crashes very sharply after reaching its peak. Another is when the price rises and is followed by a more similar decline after reaching its peak. The third is when the price rises to a peak, which is then followed by a period of gradual decline known as the period of financial distress, to be followed by a much sharper crash at some later time. One of the key findings of this study is that all these three patterns occurred during 2017-18 for the bitcoin price.
   Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to analyse the historical bitcoin prices in context with the typical five-step characteristics of a speculative bubble. Furthermore, each phase of a speculative bubble is explained by a behavioural finance approach and answer the price development of this cryptocurrency. The result is frightening, bitcoin can be seen as a perfect textbook example of a speculative bubble.

TI The VAT Treatment of Cryptocurrencies
SO EC TAX REVIEW
AB Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology will gain importance for the VAT (Value Added Tax) practice and for tax authorities in the future. The European legislator has not dealt with this issue comprehensively. In literature, the discussion regarding the VAT treatment of cryptocurrencies is still in its infancy. This article is therefore intended to illustrate the VAT treatment of cryptocurrencies. Among others, it analyses the exchange of cryptocurrencies, using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment and the mining of cryptocurrencies.

AB Governments across the world are testing different uses of the blockchain for the delivery of their public services. Blockchain hashing-or the insertion of data in the blockchain (anchoring)- is one of the potential applications of the blockchain in this space. With this method, users can apply special scripts to add their data to blockchain transactions, ensuring both immutability and publicity. Blockchain hashing also secures the integrity of the original data stored on central governmental databases. The objective of this paper is to analyse the use of data hashing (anchoring) on the blockchain for public state-owned registries. This paper starts by analysing possible scenarios of hashing on the blockchain and assesses in which cases it may work and in which it is less likely to add value to a public administration. Second, the paper also compares this method with traditional digital signatures using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) and discusses standardisation in each domain. Third, it also addresses issues related with concepts such as "distributed ledger technology" and "permissioned blockchains." Finally, it raises the question of whether blockchain hashing is an effective solution for electronic governance, and concludes that its value is controversial, even if it is improved by PKI and other security measures. In this regard, we claim that governments need to identify pain points in governance in the first place, and then consider the trade-offs of the blockchain as a potential solution versus other alternatives.

AB The device-to-device (D2D) communication is one of the promising technologies of the future Internet of Things (IoT), but its security-related issues remain challenging. The block-chain is considered to be a secure and reliable distributed ledger, so we can treat the device user equipment (D-UE) request for the reusing resources of cellular user equipment (CUE) as a transaction and put it into a transaction pool, then package the record into the block-chain. In this paper, we study the D2D communication resource allocation scheme based on sparse code multiple access (SCMA). Firstly, the system's interference model and block-chain-based transaction flow are analyzed. Then we propose the optimization problem so that CUE can get the maximum revenue by sharing its resources to DUE. This problem is NP-hard, so we propose a heuristic algorithm based on semi-definite relaxation (SDR) programming to solve it. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulation of different system parameters.

The main focus of these approaches is the feasibility of different applications. It is usually simply assumed that data in a blockchain is stored immutably. However, the path from data generation to entry into a blockchain is usually neglected. Exactly this topic is discussed in this paper and a solution proposal for a secure data flow from the machine to the blockchain is presented. For this, the hardware and software architecture of the solution is shown, followed by measurements of the operational capability of the solution.

TI CRYPTO CURRENCY AS AN OBJECT AND INSTRUMENT OF COMMITTING CRIMES
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB The article examines the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Russia. The authors study the civil and criminal law aspects of this phenomenon. The legislation does not define the legal status of cryptocurrencies, while the theory of law and court practice have not yet worked out a unified approach to it. The authors present an overview of the existing positions regarding this issue and suggest that cryptocurrency should be regarded as other property. It is stated that whatever position is incorporated into law, in real life cryptocurrency is in global circulation and has a great potential. As for criminal law, the authors show that it is relatively independent from civil law when dealing with issues within its object. It is suggested that, for the purposes of criminal law, the available instruments should be adjusted to enable a prompt reaction to the crimes committed at the present moment. The authors analyze the possibility of recognizing cryptocurrencies as an object and instrument of committing crimes within the framework of current legislation. Using the examples different crimes, the authors demonstrate that cryptocurrency could act as an instrument of committing them. It is also stated that cryptocurrency could be recognized as an object of some crimes. To support their position, the authors present such arguments as crimes of terrorism, illegal trade in drugs and psychoactive substances, economic crimes and some others. They also discuss cryptocurrency as an object of theft. It is proven that there is a practical necessity to recognize cryptocurrency as an object of theft. Criticism of this approach by some researchers is also discussed. The authors, however, show that it is possible to solve this problem positively. They conclude that current Russian and foreign legislation should be amended and should define the legal status of cryptocurrencies; however, the goal of criminal law could and should be achieved even before these amendments are adopted.

AB Currently, we are on the brink of a period of fundamental change for the healthcare expertise of specialists, i.e., existing know-how becomes less available to patients. One of the main reasons is an economic problem: most people and organisations cannot afford the services of first-rate professionals; and most economies are struggling to sustain their professional services, including schools, court systems, and health services. Another reason for the change in healthcare is the rapid growth of evidence-based medical knowledge, where a new research paper is published, on average, every forty-one seconds. Thus, evidence-based medicine is malfunctioning, and delayed, missed, and incorrect diagnoses occur in 10 to 20% of the time. Innovative IT technologies can solve the critical challenges in the healthcare domain. One of such technologies is smart contracts that manage and enforce contracts (business rules) without the interference of a third party. Smart contracts improve interoperability and privacy in cross-organisational processes. In this paper, we define problematic processes in healthcare and then provide a smart contract-based mapping for improving these processes. This paper proposes the way to overcome inequality in services accessibility, inefficient use of services and shortcomings in service quality, using smart contracts and blockchain technology.

TI Smart city and blockchain: buzzword or paradigm shift?
SO TER ES TARSADALOM
AB The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that by 2025 cities will account for 60% of global GDP, and the number of smart cities will reach 600 by 2020. In addition, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC), more than 60% of global GDP will be generated as digital income by 2022, resulting in a redesign of existing business and administrative models. As a result, within 5 years we will also see completely new technological advances at the municipal level that can greatly enhance our 'user experience'. We will be able to obtain services also at the municipal level that simplify and facilitate our everyday urban life. This process will be largely supported by the blockchain technology. Blockchain technology will have a significant impact on our city lives, economic life will undergo a paradigm shift and many local ecosystems will change for the better as it can provide free access to values and capital in a digital, secure and traceable way. In the future, for example, a Smart City will be able to raise new funds for its development through asset tokenisation. This study explains what makes blockchain technology cutting edge and what development ideas for smart cities can arise from it.

AB We study the strategic implications that arise from adding one extra option to the miners participating in the bitcoin protocol. We propose that when adding a block, miners also have the ability to pay forward an amount to be collected by the first miner who successfully extends their branch, giving them the power to influence the incentives for mining. We formulate a stochastic game for the study of such incentives and show that with this added option, smaller miners can guarantee that the best response of even substantially more powerful miners is to follow the expected behavior intended by the protocol designer.

AB Distributed identity-, attribute- and reputation- management constitutes a major benefit that a properly designed permissioned blockchain system can provide. As a complementary built-in feature set, finely-granulated and time-window-constrained auditability mechanisms aid blockchain performance and scalability by eliminating the need to front-load core transaction processing with onerous communications and computational complexity, while still meeting the requirements of effective governance, risk & compliance management and containment against compromised entities. A prevalent aspect of this methodology is the capability to determine not only what entities should be considered trustworthy, but to what extent and with which relevant functionalities, where completion of tasks entails distributing communications across multiple components as means of addressing corroboration of claimed suitability in order to choose the most trustworthy available solution components matched against specific sub-task requirements.

AB When debating a controversial topic, it is often desirable to expand the boundaries of discussion. For example, we may consider the pros and cons of possible alternatives to the debate topic, make generalizations, or give specific examples. We introduce the task of Debate Topic Expansion - finding such related topics for a given debate topic, along with a novel annotated dataset for the task. We focus on relations between Wikipedia concepts, and show that they differ from well-studied lexical-semantic relations such as hypernyms, hyponyms and antonyms. We present algorithms for finding both consistent and contrastive expansions and demonstrate their effectiveness empirically. We suggest that debate topic expansion may have various use cases in argumentation mining.

AB Peer-to-peer trading of utilities (heating, cooling and electric power) in an eco-industrial park (EIP) is key to realize significant economic and environmental benefits by exploiting synergistic co-generation and surplus trading. A crucial aspect of this symbiotic scheme is that each selfish company (prosumer) will participate in exchanging utilities to increase its own profits depending on its internal load. In this paper, an automated negotiation approach based on utility tokens is proposed to incentivize participation in a market of prosumer peers for trading surpluses in an EIP. During each negotiation episode, a pair of prosumers engage in a bilateral negotiation and resort to a learned policy to bid, concede and accept/reject using both private information and environmental variables. Contract negotiation revolves around agreeing (or not) on the price expressed in tokens of a utility profile. The time-varying value of the utility token accounts for contextual variables beyond the control of each prosumer. Simulation results demonstrate that reinforcement learning allows finding Nash equilibrium policies for smart contract negotiation in a blockchain environment.

AB As cryptographic tokens and altcoins are increasingly being built to serve as utility tokens, the notion of useful work consensus protocols, as opposed to number-crunching PoW consensus, is becoming ever more important. In such contexts, users get rewards from the network after they have carried out some specific task useful for the network. While in some cases the proof of some utility or service can be proved, the majority of tasks are impossible to verify. In order to deal with such cases, we design "Proof-of-Prestige" (PoP)-a reward system that can run on top of Proof-of-Stake blockchains. PoP introduces "prestige" which is a volatile resource and, in contrast to coins, regenerates over time. Prestige can be gained by performing useful work, spent when benefiting from services and directly translates to users minting power. PoP is resistant against Sybil and Collude attacks and can be used to reward workers for completing unverifiable tasks, while keeping the system free for the endusers. We use two exemplar use-cases to showcase the usefulness of PoP and we build a simulator to assess the cryptoeconomic behaviour of the system in terms of prestige transfer between nodes.

AB The advent of blockchain technology has been set to revolutionize the real estate industry, and the potential changes are already taking its shape. The real estate industry is one among the top global sectors that is driving the economic growth of any country. The growth of this industry is well complemented by the growth of the corporate environment, demand for office space, industrial plots, urban housing accommodations, agricultural lands, etc. However, the existing world of real estate is complicated with the lack of transparency in its transactions such as leasing, purchasing, and sales and fails to attain the level of confidentiality and authenticity of operational data. Several aspects of its operations such as property sale prices, sale history, lease rental rates, market valuation, and so on expect greater demand for transparency, data integrity, and security-a trusted environment. As a result, propertyrelated information can be made available as digitized information and hosted as decentralized database of records on distributed systems with lesser incidence of fraud and inaccuracies. The possibilities of mutual delusion and concealment during the sale, rental, and lease processes can be eliminated, thus achieving digitization of real estate ownership. Everything from making real estate investment decisions to choosing investment properties, blockchain can become a common practice by incorporating its wide benefits. This paper aims at revamping the tedious, paper-based, time-consuming system of ownership and renting into a next-generation digitized system based on blockchain technology.

TI A Multimodal Malware Detection Technique for Android IoT Devices Using
   Various Features
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Internet of things (IoT) is revolutionizing this world with its evolving applications in various aspects of life such as sensing, healthcare, remote monitoring, and so on. Android devices and applications are working hand to hand to realize dreams of the IoT. Recently, there is a rapid increase in threats and malware attacks on Android-based devices. Moreover, due to extensive exploitation of the Android platform in the IoT devices creates a task challenging of securing such kind of malware activities. This paper presents a novel framework that combines the advantages of both machine learning techniques and blockchain technology to improve the malware detection for Android IoT devices. The proposed technique is implemented using a sequential approach, which includes clustering, classification, and blockchain. Machine learning automatically extracts the malware information using clustering and classification technique and store the information into the blockchain. Thereby, all malware information stored in the blockchain history can be communicated through the network, and therefore any latest malware can be detected effectively. The implementation of the clustering technique includes calculation of weights for each feature set, the development of parametric study for optimization and simultaneously iterative reduction of unnecessary features having small weights. The classification algorithm is implemented to extract the various features of Android malware using naive Bayes classifier. Moreover, the naive Bayes classifier is based on decision trees for extracting more important features to provide classification and regression for achieving high accuracy and robustness. Finally, our proposed framework uses the permissioned blockchain to store authentic information of extracted features in a distributed malware database blocks to increase the run-time detection of malware with more speed and accuracy, and further to announce malware information for all users.

AB The main issues with drug safety in the counterfeit medicine supply chain, are to do with how the drugs are initially manufactured. The traceability of right and active pharmaceutical ingredients during actual manufacture is a difficult process, so detecting drugs that do not contain the intended active ingredients can ultimately lead to end-consumer patient harm or even death. Blockchain's advanced features make it capable of providing a basis for complete traceability of drugs, from manufacturer to end consumer, and the ability to identify counterfeit-drug. This paper aims to address the issue of drug safety using Blockchain and encrypted QR(quick response) code security.

AB Government IDs are traditionally plastic cards or paper-based passport booklets, sometimes with machine-readable contactless chips. Even though advanced implementations with cryptographic capabilities and online interfaces have been introduced, adoption and usage for online identification remain low. At the same time, there is a recognized need for trusted identities on the Internet, in Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money-Laundering processes, and also in emerging blockchain-based, decentralized ecosystems. The contribution of this paper is a thorough analysis of the opportunities and state-of-the-art at the intersection of blockchain technology and government-issued electronical identity documents (eIDs), including existing implementations and pilots.

AB Blockchain is one of the most popular topics for discussion now. However, most experts still see this technology as only part of Bitcoin, other crypto-currencies or money transfer systems. Often, new solutions, proposed by young researchers, are blocked by reviewers, only because these solutions can not be used for Bitcoins. However, Blockchain technology is more universal and can be used also in other areas, for example, in IoT, WSN and mobile devices.
   This paper considers the implementation of Blockchain technology in sensor networks as an element of IoT. The concept of "Rolling Blockchain" was proposed, which can be used to build WSN with the participation of Smart Cars, as nodes of the network.
   The order of block formation and structure in the chain is proposed and a mathematical model is created for it. We estimate the optimal number of WSN nodes, the number of connections between nodes, for specified network reliability values, was performed.

AB The article is devoted to the nature of money as the basis for the emergence of a new phenomenon-cryptocurrency and, in particular, Bitcoin. In order to clarify the controversy surrounding the phenomenon of Bitcoin and its popularity, the author tries to reveal its main essence and to answer the question whether Bitcoin is a new form of a financial pyramid. For this, the essence of the financial pyramid, its types, the principle of work from an economic and legal point of view are considered. The author comes to the conclusion that, despite the fact that Bitcoin has a number of signs of a financial pyramid, it is not, although it has a number of drawbacks-limited walking, lack of legal framework, insecurity, and others. Bitcoin has bright signs of a financial bubble; at a sufficiently high cost of the transaction, bitcoin mining is little profitable. In the opinion of the author, Bitcoin currently has two main ways: recognition as a world currency or definition as a financial pyramid. But due to its shortcomings, Bitcoin, as a world currency, is imperfect and currently has more characteristics and signs of the financial pyramid phenomenon.

AB Food provenance is one of the most challenging problems that FSC companies face today. A global supply chain network with multiple operating procedures and asymmetrical food regulations between countries makes end-to-end food tracking incidental to the food industry. Blockchain empowers new kinds of distributed applications design. Initially, Blockchain technology has been embraced in electronic money, yet this tech is significantly more promising for different areas too. In this paper, we are getting to present Blockchain technology easily. Additionally, we are talking that Blockchain technological innovation is also utilized in the industrial process,from the retail industry to its advantage towards the client and additionally for that merchant to fantastic scope. During its heart, Blockchain is mainly thrilling because of the ability that it must empower increased confidence, transparency, and cooperation round constituencies which will otherwise battle to reach up to now better. As distribution chain sophistication rises, there is an apparent chance to induce efficiency as a result of higher cooperation and transparency in between various constituencies like manufacturing companies, vendors and delivery carriers, insurance, importers, wholesalers, and merchants. Being aware of in Real-time the specific supply, spot, and condition of most inventory while in the machine might be quite a game-changer for most organizations, notably those working in perishable or luxury-goods. Unlike present systems, that rely heavily upon every element to keep its clear and dispersed database significance restricted and frequently postponed penetration to the standing of products anyplace from the machine Blockchain eases real-time and dependable information sharing one of the components and may provide consensus regarding the actual condition of their machine into parties.

AB The Bitcoin payment system involves two agent types: Users that transact with the currency and pay fees and miners in charge of authorizing transactions and securing the system in return for these fees. Two of Bitcoin's challenges are (i) securing sufficient miner revenues as block rewards decrease, and (ii) alleviating the throughput limitation due to a small maximal block size cap. These issues are strongly related as increasing the maximal block size may decrease revenue due to Bitcoin's pay-your-bid approach. To decouple them, we analyze the "monopolistic auction" [8], showing: (i) its revenue does not decrease as the maximal block size increases, (ii) it is resilient to an untrusted auctioneer (the miner), and (iii) simplicity for transaction issuers (bidders), as the average gain from strategic bid shading (relative to bidding one's true maximal willingness to pay) diminishes as the number of bids increases.

TI A System with Zero Reserves and with Clearing Outside of the Central
   Bank: The Canadian Case
SO REVIEW OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB In a number of ways, implementing monetary policy in Canada stands apart from monetary policy in most other industrial countries. Commercial banks and other participants to the main clearinghouse - the large-value transfer system (LVTS) - hold no reserves at the central bank. Clearing and settlement is both in real time and net, while only settlement occurs on the books of the central bank. The Bank of Canada does not conduct open-market operations and rarely intervenes in the repo market; and despite this, the collateralized overnight rate always remains within 2 or 3 basis points of the target interest rate. The paper explains why this is so by describing the setup of the Canadian clearing and settlement system, including the rules that have been put forward in case a bank defaults on its due payments before settlement occurs. Some puzzles that arose through the years are also discussed, as well as the unlikely prospect of introducing blockchain technology in the Canadian clearing and settlement system.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of breakthrough technological areas, such as artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the internet of things, and blockchain upon on conventional banking professions and skill sets. Our conclusions are based upon a large array of data collected over the course of a survey of top personnel conducted in 2017-2018 using text mining, case studies, and expert interviews. The changing requirements for workers and their competences were assessed taking into account the level of technological development (including use of relevant products and services by Russian and international companies) as well as the probability of certain professional skills being substituted by automated solutions in the medium term. The results indicate that technologies' impact upon various functional segments of banks' operations is varied. While most of the analyzed professions are evolving towards broader functionality, others are sliding into the "obsolete" group. In the next few years, automated systems will take full responsibility for data collection and its initial analysis, though they will not replace bank personnel fully given that they simply remain tools that help boost workers' productivity and efficiency, extend the information base, accelerate decision-making, cut costs, and reduce risks.

AB Nowadays digital transaction security is seen as essential in an online payment system. Earlier, cryptographic authentication techniques were used to make transactions very secure with third-party verification. However, in recent times, digital transactions have developed to allow online payments to be made directly from one party to another, without the intervention of the third party. This kind of P2P network transaction is achieved by utilizing the blockchain innovation. A blockchain uses the idea of Bitcoin. It isn't observed by the central authority, but its clients direct and approve exchanges when one individual pays another for merchandise or administrations, dispensing with the requirement for outside confirmation. All finished exchanges are freely recorded as a block and each block is added one after other to form as a blockchain. In this paper, we present the workflow of a digital online payment system using the blockchain technique. We explain the secure sign-in procedure of the blockchain strategy. We elaborate on the effects of blockchain technology on the online transaction management system in terms of security and usability.

AB Secure access control to a wide variety of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has become critical. Blockchain-based access control frameworks are promising technologies to support secure access to IoT devices in pervasive computing applications. However, in most of the proposed solutions, the IoT devices rely on a trusted server to retrieve critical access control data from the blockchains. We propose a method for IoT devices to validate blockchain data without solely being dependent on a central server. In our approach, several witnesses on the network can be selected randomly by the devices to validate access control information. Our method is aided by Bloom filters, which are shown to be lightweight for resource-constrained devices.

TI SPIRIT IN THE CRYPT NEGARESTANI VS LAND
SO COSMOS AND HISTORY-THE JOURNAL OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL PHILOSOPHY
AB Iranian philosopher Reza Negarestani's first 2008 book Cyclonopedia was written under the influence of Nick Land's nihilistic and antihumanist philosophy which seeks to critique anthropomorphism by confronting us with our coming extinction beyond which our concepts of reason cannot reach. Since Cyclonopedia's publication, however, Negarestani has left behind Landian nihilism to develop in his 2018 book Intelligence and Spirit a neorationalist philosophy of mind whose primary influences are Sellars, Brandom, and Hegel. At 579 clearly written yet dense pages, it is difficult even for a review article to encapsulate the book in its entirety. The first half of this article instead aims to provide a sense of the book's overall project by focusing on how Negarestani outlines and develops his neorationalist philosophy through a critique of Land's antihumanism.
   Never one to remain silent whilst others seek to resurrect Hegel from the dead, since December 2018, Land has been releasing a draft on his blog Urban Futures 2.1 of his new monograph Crypto-Current: Bitcoin and Philosophy, which proffers the most up to date articulation of his main antihumanist tenets. Having organized Intelligence and Spirit around Negarestani's objections to Land, this article's second half turns to Crypto-Current to see how Land is able to provide convincing responses to each of Negarestani's objections, showing some to be based on strawman characterizations, others to stem from misunderstandings of Land's position, and still others to lack traction at all. By putting Negarestani and Land's new books in combat, we will ultimately see that the grounds for Negarestani's efforts to move continental philosophy from its Kanto-Landian phase to a renewed Hegelian phase is unsuccessful in that antihumanism is able to respond to each of his objections in kind.

AB The concept of hlockchain radio access network (B-RAN) was proposed to integrate cross-network resources including spectra and infrastructures to meet the explosive growth of diverse connectivity needs. In this work, we consider the prototype design of B-RAN and address the issues arising in its implementation. To reduce the access delay, we develop a fast smart contract deployment (FSCD) for B-RAN. Also, we propose the concept of digitized spectrum assets (DSA) in BRAN for efficient spectrum sharing and management. We further summarize and demonstrate the B-RAN prototype enhanced by the newly introduced FSCD and DSA, along with the overall workflow. We apply comprehensive simulations based on an in-house experimental platform to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed B-RAN prototype.

AB Blockchain technology provides the advantage of maintaining a network without third party intervention, providing transparency because all participants have distributed ledgers with the same data. Using these characteristics, blockchain technology is being used in various fields, but the anonymity of blockchain can be exploited for illegal trades in the Darknet market. Therefore, a monitoring system for transactions occurring on the blockchain is needed. This paper proposes a monitoring system and an explorer to show the results collected from the system.

AB The block chain technology is changing rapidly. The block chain guarantees the integrity of the book through a specific consensus of the participants. In the past, the block chain technology had a limited range of applications. However, the use of block chain technology is gradually expanding as smart contracts that can formulate general business logic are mentioned. Already studied the components of smart contracts in other studies and proposed the possibility of extending them on the basis of ontology. And research on securing traceability of smart contract based on ontology has been carried out. However, research on various transactions constituting smart contracts is lacking. In this paper, the constituent elements of smart contract are analyzed and expressed by ontology. And the process of negotiating the components is represented by each transaction. Finally, we construct the component represented by the ontology as XML by including the state information in the transaction. In this way, the smart contract is represented in a formal language that contains state information. It also laid the foundation for a smart contract that can be reused and verified.

AB Consensus is so important that it has always occupied its crucial position in human society. In particular, the meaning and importance of consensus in democratic society is much more special because it is a social system that operates based on the consensus among people. Up to now, human society has reached consensus by using the majority vote, but it is clear that there are several problems in it. Meanwhile, there are lots of researches which have been carried out so far to develop the appropriate methodology and tools for reaching out consensus. However, these researches suggest that measurement to derive the result is difficult for general purpose in that the evaluation is one-time, and that the trust problem arises from delegating the consensus process to the 3-rd party such as information system is not solved. In this paper, we propose an iterative consensus process which can solve the problems above, and general description about this process is included. The proposed process draws consensus in an iterative way, visualize the information generated from iteration, presents it to the participants, and supports the participants' consensus through structured discussion. In addition, the trust problem, which occurs when a consensus process is delegated to the information system can be solved with utilizing the blockchain technology by conveying and ensuring the reliability of the result, and this proposed process can adopt it.

SO INTERNET OF THINGS IN THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR: SECURITY AND DEVICE
   CONNECTIVITY, SMART ENVIRONMENTS, AND INDUSTRY 4.0
SE Computer Communications and Networks Series
AB The introduction and enactment of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) have initiated a global revolution. The volume and variety of data that are collected and processed in industries are ever increasing due to the widespread acceptance of modern technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, edge computing, and cloud storage. Conventional systems with centralized architecture are not designed to handle the complexity and scale of data that is processed in IIoT operations. Moreover, the threat of security and privacy breaches also increases with the growth of IIoT-connected devices. IoT devices often tend to have poor security defense systems due to low processing power, limited storage capabilities, and poor manufacturing standards. In this context, blockchain technology can help to eliminate the security vulnerabilities faced by the IIoT systems and provides extensive protection from data thefts, cyberattacks, and data corruption. Blockchain with its distributed architecture offers peer-to-peer networking and enables auditable and transparent transactions. This chapter explores the concept of IIoT and its limitations, and the need for deploying blockchain mechanisms in the IIoT paradigm. We further analyze blockchain technology and how it can reinforce IIoT systems. Existing systems of blockchain in the IIoT ecosystems and relevant use cases are also explored. As conventional systems struggle to handle the scale of data operations handled by the IIoT, blockchain has emerged as a viable solution to reinforce and reform existing systems.

TI Legal challenges about blockchain
SO REVISTA DE DERECHO CIVIL
AB Among those technological tools which currently trigger great interest are so-called "blockchains". Since the launch of Blockchain in 2009, many such systems have been devised. As is apparent, this technology tends to eliminate intermediaries, while guaranteeing and even increase the security they provide. At the same time, it improves efficiency while reducing costs. Like any other new technology, it must address the legal challenges that arise from its use. The goal of this paper is to address some of those referred to public blockchains-specially, Blockchain-, to wit: the lack of ownership, the limits of their registry functions, concerns regarding the identity of the participants, the character of cryptocurrencies and their relationship to tax structure or legal money, and finally, the legal smart contracts that can be executed using this technology.

AB A disruptive revolution is forming for the blockchain based communication network framework with end-to-end P2P based architecture of distributed computation, storage, and networking paradigm - the Next Generation Blockchain Network (NGBN). The core theme of NGBN is to push up communication PHY layer and push down application layer (e.g. storage and computation) to converge on a single networking layer - called Blockchain Network Layer (BNL) - such that blockchain token economy can be efficiently implemented to support an end-to-end P2P mesh network with unlimitedly scalable, available to everyone, and expandable by peer nodes' joining openly, robust and secure network environment for all the IoT, big data, AI applications to be coming in the next 10 years. To achieve this goal, a joint effort is needed to pull together various resources, including network resources, communication resources, application and chip level support, software and system, and initial proof of concept trials for the end-to-end deployment.

AB Proof of Stake (PoS) protocols rely on voting mechanisms to reach consensus on the current state. If an enhanced majority of staking nodes, also called validators, agree on a proposed block, then this block is appended to the blockchain. Yet, these protocols remain vulnerable to faults caused by validators who abstain either accidentally or maliciously.
   To protect against such faults while retaining the PoS selection and reward allocation schemes, we study weighted voting in validator committees. We formalize the block creation process and introduce validators' voting profiles which we update by a multiplicative weights algorithm relative to validators' voting behavior and aggregate blockchain rewards. Using this framework, we leverage weighted majority voting rules that optimize collective decision making to show, both numerically and analytically, that the consensus mechanism is more robust if validators' votes are appropriately scaled. We raise potential issues and limitations of weighted voting in trustless, decentralized networks and relate our results to the design of current PoS protocols.

AB Blockchain (BC) technology is a rather new conception of a mixed hardware and software platform to achieve distributed consensus among peers. Its diffusion is related to cryptocurrency, the most widespread of which is Bitcoin. The protocol on which BCs operate sees the interaction between users, interested in performing their transactions, and miners, who certify the trust behind the transactions by putting some form of effort that allows acknowledging their trustfulness, obtaining Bitcoins in reward for their work. In the so-called proof-of-work implementation of the BC, such effort is the computational power needed to find a specific string of bits called nonce. The resulting game-theoretic setting has subtle dynamics, and its functioning could be strongly improved using closed-loop control. This work is an attempt to define a control-oriented description of the agent-based BC dynamics and offer a redesign of the difficulty control system that regulates the amount of work needed to add a new trusted block to the BC. This control loop directly relates to the energy consumption of the overall system, which is one of the major drivers that will determine the future sustainability of the BC paradigm.

AB With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Thing (IoT) devices, many security challenges could be introduced at low-end routers. Misbehaving routers affect the availability of the networks by dropping packets selectively and rejecting data forwarding services. Although existing Reputation Management (RM) systems are useful in identifying misbehaving routers, the centralized nature of the RM center has the risk of one-point failure. The emerging blockchain techniques, with the inherent decentralized consensus mechanism, provide a promising method to reduce this one-point failure risk. By adopting the distributed consensus mechanism, we propose a blockchain-based reputation management system in IoT networks to overcome the limitation of centralized router RM systems. The proposed solution utilizes the blockchain technique as a decentralized database to store router reports for calculating reputation of each router. With the proposed reputation calculation mechanism, the reliability of each router would be evaluated, and the malicious misbehaving routers with low reputations will be blacklisted and get isolated. More importantly, we develop an optimized group mining process for blockchain technique in order to improve the efficiency of block generation and reduce the resource consumption. The simulation results validate the distributed blockchain-based RM system in terms of attacks detection and system convergence performance, and the comparison result of the proposed group mining process with existing blockchain models illustrates the applicability and feasibility of the proposed works.

AB Token represents the right to do some operations in software. In blockchain, there are two types of tokens: utility token and security token. They endow the items of token more value in blockchain world. In order to achieve asset tokenization, we propose a new kind of token in this paper, the asset-backed token, which is used for the proposed blockchain based Open Asset Protocol (OAP). Using OAP, we show to how to convert both of the real and virtual objects to asset-backed tokens on blockchain. Then we discussed a new method for data utilization and privacy-preserving based on OAP and compare with our previous scheme, the Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). Additionally, we introduce the Policy-Backed Token(PBT), which is an instance implementing OAP in insurance industry. We have applied PBT in the airline travel insurance product E-life of an insurance company.

TI BCDP: A Blockchain-based Credible Data Publishing System
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
AB With the advent of the era of big data, how to publish electronic data in a manner of credible become a challenge. Traditional data publishing schemes either require a trusted third party (TTP) that is responsible to collect and publish data, or cannot support similar data duplicate detection. The result is that they are vulnerable to distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and suffer from an unnecessary waste of storage space. To address the above issue, in this paper, we propose a blockchainbased credible data publishing model (BCDP), which enjoys the properties of decentralized, tamper resistant and anti-DDoS attacks. Then, we construct a two-layer near duplicate detection algorithm with counting bloom filter (CBF) that can detect near duplicate data based on BCDP. In addition, we exploit an academic publishing system based on BCDP, which introduces an academic scoring mechanism to achieve reward and punishment for academic publishing.

TI Optimizing MEC Networks for Healthcare Applications in 5G Communications
   With the Authenticity of Users' Priorities
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is pervasive to support high-speed end-to-end data transmission and computation for 5th generation (5G) mobile communications by offloading computation tasks to the cloud at the edge of a cellular base station. In a cellular network for healthcare applications, we must consider the different priorities of data transmission and computation by referring to the emergency levels of patients. A critical issue of determining the allocation of wireless resources among users is the authenticity of their priorities (i.e., emergency levels). Without authenticating the users' priorities, a user who advocates a higher emergency level can allocate more wireless resources, leading to the insufficient wireless resources to the users who are actually in high priorities. In this paper, we investigate the optimization of end-to-end delay of wireless users in a cellular network with the authenticity of their priorities by blockchain consensus and propose an algorithm of allocating communication and computation resources to minimize the delay of data transmission and computation. The numerical results illustrate that our proposed algorithm is capable of dramatically reducing the end-to-end delay under the various scenarios of healthcare applications.

AB Blockchain is defined as a distributed ledger technology that can implement financial models. An improved blockchain provides a democratic virtual economic system (DVES) that can verify payments, reach consensus, and store encrypted data in virtual economic systems. In this paper, we review the latest progress and possibilities in improved blockchain with respect to openness, data security, and scalability. This paper outlines the challenges of value, existence, and status (VES) and the state-of-the-art solutions for improved blockchain. Then, this paper discusses the VES in terms of distributed energy, ownership certification, infrastructure, and other fields. More importantly, it analyzed the importance of scale out, which can be a key enabler to solve the main practical problems in constructing DVES.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that features a distributed, decentralized and trustworthy mechanism, which has made Bitcoin a popular global transaction platform. The transaction efficiency among nations and the privacy benefiting from address anonymity of the Bitcoin network have attracted many activities such as payments, investments, gambling, and even money laundering in the past decade. Unfortunately, some criminal behaviors which took advantage of this platform were not identified. This has discouraged many governments to support cryptocurrency. Thus, the capability to identify criminal addresses becomes an important issue in the cryptocurrency network. In this paper, we propose new features in addition to those commonly used in the literature to build a classification model for detecting abnormality of Bitcoin network addresses. These features include various high orders of moments of transaction time (represented by block height) which summarizes the transaction history in an efficient way. The extracted features are trained by supervised machine learning methods on a labeling category data set. The experimental evaluation shows that these features have improved the performance of Bitcoin address classification significantly. We evaluate the results under eight classifiers and achieve the highest Micro-F1 / Macro-F1 of 87% / 86% with LightGBM.

AB Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Its notable characteristics of the distributed ledger, trustless system, and immutability not only makes it a disruptive innovation in the electronic payment industry but also potential solutions for other areas that require trust establishment. Electronic voting (E-voting) scheme is a use-case where all attributes of blockchain can offer a mechanism for an open, fair and universally verifiable electoral process. In this paper, we review the requirements and then propose Votereum, an E-voting system that utilizes the blockchain technology. The proposed system is empowered by Ethereum platform, including one server manages the entire system and the other handles all blockchain-related requests. The implementation is also deployed to Rinkeby testing network for evaluation on the feasibility and discussion on some security concerns, which are mentioned in the conclusion of this paper.

AB The massive adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) requires the grid system to coordinate with a large number of energy transactions, where the current grid network poses vulnerability against the excessive power loads and attacks. The difficulty of an efficient charging/discharging control mechanism lies on the randomness of future events and scalability of the transaction platform. In this paper, a Proof-of-Benefit consensus mechanism with Online benefit generating (ONPoB) algorithm is proposed on the blockchain platform to handle the EV charging/discharging loads to flatten the overall power load fluctuation. It is demonstrated that all EVs can be charged and achieves a best-known competitive ratio of 2.39. The ONPoB consensus mechanism is approved to better accommodate the EV scenario compared with other mechanisms. And the ONPoB algorithm is able to substantially reduce the Power Fluctuation Level (PFL) in comparison with popular scheduling algorithms.

TI Electric Vehicle Power Trading Mechanism Based on Blockchain and Smart
   Contract in V2G Network
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In order to realize peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions between electric vehicles (EVs) in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, we propose an EV power trading model based on blockchain and smart contract. Firstly, based on the blockchain and smart contract technology, a decentralized power trading model is proposed to realize the information equivalence and transparent openness of power trading. Then, considering the randomness and uncertainty of EV charging and discharging, the EV trading parties use the reverse auction mechanism based on dynamic pricing strategy to complete the transaction matching, which can not only improve the profit of the less competitive power seller, but also it can reduce the cost of the electricity purchaser. Finally, in order to verify the feasibility of our proposed scheme, V2Gs EV power trading smart contract was designed, and the smart contract was released to Ethereum and simulated experiments were carried out. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by simulation experiments and comparison with traditional power trading schemes.

TI A Survey on Security Verification of Blockchain Smart Contracts
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties, which is executed by the computer code. The code does the execution without giving either party the ability to back out, so it ensures the trustless execution. The smart contract is one of the most important features in blockchain applications, which implements trusted transactions without third parties. However, with the rapid development, blockchain smart contracts have also exposed many security problems, and some attacks caused by contract vulnerabilities have led to terrible losses. In order to better deal with such dilemma, making a comprehensive survey about the security verification of blockchain smart contracts from major scientific databases is quite indispensable. Even though the significance of studying security verification of blockchain smart contracts is evident, it is really fresh yet. The major contributions of our survey work come from three aspects. First, after retrieving all-sided research studies, we select 53 most related papers to show the state-of-the art of this topic, where 20 papers focus on dealing with security assurance of blockchain smart contracts, and 33 papers focus on the correctness verification of blockchain smart contracts. Second, we propose a taxonomy toward the topic of security verification of blockchain smart contracts and discuss the pros and cons of each category of related studies. Third, through in-depth analysis of these studies, we come to know that the correctness verification of smart contracts based on the formal method has already become the more significant and more effective method to validate whether a smart contract is credible and accurate. So, we further present representative studies of formal verification of smart contracts in detail to demonstrate that using a formal method to validate blockchain smart contracts must have a promising and meritorious future.

AB The rapid development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) necessitates a secure and reliable infrastructure to store and share the massive data. Blockchain, a distributed and immutable ledger, is widely considered as a promising solution to ensure data security and privacy for IoV. To deal with the massive IoV data, the scalability of blockchain becomes a critical issue, which should maximize transactional throughput as well as handling the dynamics of IoV scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IoV, where transactional throughput is maximized while guaranteeing the decentralization, latency and security of the underlying blockchain system. In this framework, we first carry out the performance analysis for blockchain systems from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency and security. Further, DRL technique is adopted to select block producers and adjust block size and block interval to adapt to the dynamics of IoV scenarios. Simulation results show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the throughput of blockchain-enabled IoV systems without affecting other properties.

AB The traditional electricity markets are facing challenges in integrating the distributed generation extensively. However, the local energy markets have the potential to support the local integration of DG and facilitate the local balance of energy supply and demand. The operation and management of local energy markets require support from the efficient and reliable information technology. Blockchain technology has the potential to be used in local energy trading, but it is difficult to support frequent trades among the rising number of market participants, due to the basic design principle of the technology. Therefore, we present the offchain energy trading method and an asynchronous transaction recording mechanism to ensure the efficiency of energy trading procedures. To support off-chain energy trading, we design a local energy trading cyber-physical system. The overview of the local energy market and the framework of the blockchain-based local energy trading system are illustrated respectively.

The block chain open source community typically consists of project leaders, developers, users, and investors. The original intention of block chain tokens is to stimulate the ecosystem, and the incentive mechanism for tokens is effective in providing funds and generating incentives for project development. But the token incentive mechanism also has limitations. After the upsurge of block chain project creation and investment, it is necessary for project participants to raise their understanding of tokens, promote the forthcoming block chain open source projects to design tokens distribution scheme more carefully, trigger industry self-regulation, ensure fair distribution and practical application, and return to the original intention of issuing block chain tokens.

TI A Blockchain-Based Medical Data Sharing and Protection Scheme
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Electronic health record (EHR) has recorded the process of occurrence, development, and treatment of diseases. So it has high medical value. Owing to the private and sensitive nature of medical data for patients, the data sharing and privacy preservation are critical issues in EHR. Blockchain technology may be a promising solution for the problems above since it holds the features of decentralization and tamper resistance. In the paper, we propose a medical data sharing and protection scheme based on the hospital's private blockchain to improve the electronic health system of the hospital. Firstly, the scheme can satisfy various security properties such as decentralization, openness, and tamper resistance. A reliable mechanism is created for the doctors to store medical data or access the historical data of patients while meeting privacy preservation. Furthermore, a symptoms-matching mechanism is given between patients. It allows patients who get the same symptoms to conduct mutual authentication and create a session key for their future communication about the illness. The proposed scheme is implemented by using PBC and OpenSSL libraries. Finally, the security and performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is given.

TI MBPA: A Medibchain-Based Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication in
   TMIS for Mobile Medical Cloud Architecture
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) integrates various types of mobile devices and communication technologies to upgrade the traditional face-to-face medical treatment model to intelligent one, which can provide the flexible and convenient e-health care. Due to the complexity and openness of Internet, e-health care data is grabbing the interest of cyber attackers. Hence, security and privacy are still our dominant concerns. Fortunately, blockchain technology leverages decentralized or distributed process to ensure data security. A MediBchain-based privacy-preserving mutual authentication for mobile medical cloud architecture (abbreviated to MBPA) is proposed in this paper. MBPA scheme not only mitigates the weaknesses of existing ones, but has other advantages. First, MBPA scheme supports patients anonymity and traceability since the patients identity is hidden in two dynamic anonyms and a static anonym and only the trusted center can recover his/her real identity. Second, each MediBchain node shares a secret value, which realizes authentication with extremely low computional cost between terminals and MediBchain nodes. Finally, MBPA scheme is proven safely against passive and active attacks under elliptic curve computational Diffie-Hellman problem (ECDHP) assumption in random oracle model. Hence, these features make MBPA scheme very suitable for computation-limited mobile devices compared with other related existing schemes.

TI Decentralization is Vulnerable Under the Gap Game
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The blockchain is the core mechanism of Bitcoin, which is mainly enabled by a distributed consensus mechanism. Essentially, in Proof-of-Work-based consensus protocol, the miners generate a series of blocks to realize decentralization practical. Miners receive two types of revenue: block rewards and transaction fees, in which the reward of block drops off as time goes on. Carlsten et al. defined a mining gap and then Tsabary et al. analyzed the gap game exploring how mining gaps form. In this paper, we analyze the other implications of the gap game. First, it is well known that the security of Bitcoin decentralized consensus protocol relies on miners behaving correctly. The security of the blockchain system will be threatened in case of the consensus mechanism is breached. Therefore, we also described how the gap game impacts the decentralization of Bitcoin and the stability of blockchain. Second, to confirm the implication, we discuss what aspects of decentralization can be impacted by the gap game; then we defined a new decentralization model and listed its main features.

TI Analysis of Blockchain Solutions for IoT: A Systematic Literature Review
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting things to the Internet in a peer-to-peer paradigm for data collecting and data sharing in our daily life. A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain.

AB Robotic events can provide notable amounts of information regarding a robot's status, which can be extrapolated to detect productivity, anomalies, malfunctions and used for monitorization. However, when problems occur in sensitive environments like a factory, the logs of a machine may be discarded because they are susceptible to chances and malicious intents. In this paper we propose to use RobotChain for anomaly detection. RobotChain is a method to securely register robotic events, using a blockchain, which ensures that once an event gets registered on it, it's secured and cannot be tampered with. We show how this system can be leveraged with the module for anomaly detection, that uses the information contained on the blockchain to detect anomalies on a UR3 robot.

AB Blockchain technology enables the execution of collaborative business processes involving mutually untrusted parties. Existing tools allow such processes to be modeled using high-level notations and compiled into smart contracts that can be deployed on blockchain platforms. However, these tools brush aside the question of who is allowed to execute which tasks in the process, either by deferring the question altogether or by adopting a static approach where all actors are bound to roles upon process instantiation. Yet, a key advantage of blockchains is their ability to support dynamic sets of actors. This paper presents a model for dynamic binding of actors to roles in collaborative processes and an associated binding policy specification language. The proposed language is endowed with a Petri net semantics, thus enabling policy consistency verification. The paper also outlines an approach to compile policy specifications into smart contracts for enforcement. An experimental evaluation shows that the cost of policy enforcement increases linearly with the number of roles and constraints.

TI Avoiding Liability: Changing the Regulatory Structure of
   Cryptocurrencies to Better Ensure Legal Use
SO IOWA LAW REVIEW
AB Monitoring the transactions consumers in the United States make when buying and selling virtual currency requires an inventive regulatory system because many types of virtual currency, like Bitcoin, are operated anonymously and independently. In the United States today, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has little structure in how it monitors cryptocurrencies, merely classifying them as property and having the taxpayer report all losses and gains subject to the rules of personal property. This classification is difficult to apply because the IRS has little control over how the system is regulated. To solve this issue, the United States should either outlaw the use of cryptocurrency altogether or reclassify virtual currency as foreign currency. Making virtual currency use illegal might not be the most practical solution because of its prominence in the market today, but it would provide the federal government a clear way to deal with cryptocurrency. If the United States reclassifies virtual currency as a foreign currency, there would be an established regulatory frame-work in place that the IRS would be able to follow when attempting to monitor the use of virtual currency. With either solution, the United States will be better equipped to regulate the financial marketplace of virtual currencies.

AB Traditional centralized token exchange (CEX) is criticized for its security and privacy issues, since cryptocurrency users are required to surrender their private keys to the exchange. In contrast, decentralized token exchange (DEX) solves this issue by introducing additional trading gas fee and latency to the system. Hybrid decentralized token exchange (HEX) has been proposed to combine the advantages of CEX and DEX. However, existing HEX is still suffering from two issues. The first issue is that it is unfriendly for a trader who needs to exchange tokens frequently within a certain period of time, due to the fact that it is time-consuming and expensive. The second issue is the potential network congestion in Ethereum caused by excessive simultaneous transactions from the exchange. In this paper, we propose a payment channel based HEX, which extends existing solutions by adding a new payment channel layer to benefit frequent traders and alleviate network congestion.

AB Nowadays, the Internet has become a huge network composed of multiple autonomous systems (ASs) which are managed by various network operators. Network operators try to apply different network optimization technologies, based on link state information such as link bandwidth, link delay, to improve the network performance. However, inter-domain network optimization is hard to realize due to the lack of inter-domain link state information while one AS can only gather the link state information inside itself. Obviously, network information sharing among different ASs is necessary. Supporting for "trustless disintermediation", blockchain technology provides capabilities for cooperation among different ASs. We propose a new blockchain-based framework named BGP Link State Sharing Chain(BGP-LSChain), to help different AS owners sharing inter-domain link state. In this framework, we integrate a data verification mechanism and an AS credit rating mechanism to prevent fake data, which are realized by various smart contracts to control data sharing, data verification and credit rating. We implement an BGP-LSChain prototype and conduct experiments to evaluate it. The results show that while helping sharing data among different AS owners, the time cost of BGP-LSChain operations is within a reasonable and acceptable range.

Blockchain is increasingly addressed as the upcoming "revolution" in music industry and is often acclaimed as a new "disruptive technology", able to change the game in the music business. The article analyses how this innovation is discursively constructed by news articles, start-ups self-presentations and other documents. From a theoretical point of view, the analysis relies on concepts coming from Science & Technology Studies (STS) and especially information infrastructure studies and the study of technological promises, thus enriching the intersection between sound studies and STS. On these bases, the article outlines an overview of the 'hype' discourse generated around music blockchain, recognizing five main technological promises supporting the adoption of blockchain. Moreover, it also brings to the foreground some concerns about the possible consequences of this adoption for the evolution of music value and music circulation processes.

TI Economic Simulation of Cryptocurrencies and Their Control Mechanisms
SO LEDGER
AB A cryptocurrency needs a relatively stable value if it is to fulfill the traditional functions of money and be useful as a currency. To achieve this, controls are needed within the ecosystem of the cryptocurrency. Although a simulation cannot predict future currency rates or other variables exactly, it is argued that a model that simulates a range of challenging behavior can be a useful test bed for control schemes. To illustrate and explore this idea, an agent-based economic model was used to simulate the early period of a hypothetical cryptocurrency and test two control mechanisms. The results suggest that this approach may be fruitful and that it may be important to include more than just coin minting within the control scheme. An economic simulation model is likely to be a valuable tool in developing and regulating effective cryptocurrency systems.

TI Estimating Service Quality in Industrial Internet-of-Things Monitoring
   Applications With Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Internet of Things (IoT) plays a big role in automating information generation and consumption in industrial monitoring applications. Blockchain can allow this information to be stored in a manner that is both accessible and reliable for the IoT devices to work with. Blockchain has the capability to collect data from IoT devices and store it in a distributed manner that prevents tampering with the data. This paper discusses the use of blockchain to calculate the Service Quality (SQ) in an Industrial IoT for monitoring application. The proposed framework looks at the blockchain as a finite number of fragmented pieces of data corresponding to a specific industrial <italic>process</italic>. The SQ is expressed as penalties which is the difference between the expected IoT sensor values and the actual sensor data in reported events from the IoT devices. It also moderates the penalty between similar industrial processes based on each other. The moderation allows better understanding of the system functions and identification of specific problems rather than simply recording the sensor data for a single process. Furthermore, this paper analyzes private blockchains for suitability in IIoT and summarizes some key challenges for IoT to be used with blockchain in context of the proposed framework. The paper uses supply chain as a use case scenario for describing the proposed framework and presents results on its technical feasibility.

AB The multifaceted nature, specificity and huge social importance of the country's food security problem, one of the aspects of which is the formation of conditions for the production of quality food products, necessitates systematic studies aimed at observing the existing quality standards, starting from grass and fodder seeds, harvesting, storing, feeding animals, making products, transporting them, and up to the consumer basket. Current control systems at the individual technological stages of the production of feed, finished products at the manufacturing plant and incoming inspection in retail organizations no longer provide the required level of quality. To control the observance of established standards, the world practice has a positive experience of using the blockchain technology in some areas of activity, based on the transparency of the entire technological process of manufacturing products having numerous stages. In this work, we analyze the international and domestic practice of using the blockchain technology and explore the conceptual approaches to its use in the management of supply chains of dairy products. The using of the blockchain technology in the management of supply chain of dairy products will ensure the safety of data, protection of the repository of documents from hacking, eliminate the possibility of making changes in information on the progress of transportation, reduce delays in delivery, reduce the chance of unauthorized use of banned or unwanted ingredients, allow retailers and even consumers to browse the history of the product creation: to determine the dairy farm of origin, the dairy plant, the carrier, optimize delivery processes of raw materials and finished products from the producer to the consumer and reduce transport costs participants.

AB This paper is devoted to both the detection of transactions that can participate in money laundering schemes and the possibility of modification of payment systems based on blockchain technology in the interests of AML/CFT. In the process of work, the research of transaction anonymization method with the use of a decentralized approach based on Coin Join transactions is performed. Also, methods of tracking such transactions, the possibility of their deanonymization and the ability to determine the relationships between users and their transactions are examined. The results show that tracking Coin Join transactions is a feasible task that allows to determine the fact of user participation in the creation of a transaction, which gives additional advantages in the process of detecting transactions involved in money laundering schemes.

TI Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain: Opportunities and Limits of a New
   Monetary Regime
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Cryptocurrency innovations such as Bitcoin raise the question of the possible transformation of the monetary regime and how it would operate. The blockchain technology underlying Bitcoin is said to be "trustless" because it has been designed to avoid a "trusted third party." Drawing on the institutionalist approach of Aglietta and Orlean emphasizing the importance of trust in money and the monetary system, we show that Bitcoin is characterized by: (1) methodical trust through the existence of an objective proof of payment; (2) hierarchical trust due to the concentration in the mining process; and (3) ethical trust organized around the rejection of banks and the state, although the early ethical commitment is unstable. In other words, trust is now materialized in a form of technical institution, the blockchain. However, Bitcoin cannot be used as everyday money as it would bring about a deflationist and dysfunctional monetary regime, as well as high transaction costs. Some other cryptocurrencies could lead to interesting transformations of the monetary regime if they were to provide new forms of sovereignty, avoid a design based on a fixed monetary supply, or if central banks decided to back them.

AB In the context of globalization, the problem of creating an integrated ecosystem of national and international supply chains becomes actual. Currently, the organization and supply chain management (SCM) are characterized by the inefficient use of existing assets, lack of flexibility and transparency of operations, complex and dynamic interaction between the chain participants. Blockchain technology provides for the real possibility to ensure the innovation and technological development of SCM. Harmonization of the fundamental principles of the blockchain technology and supply chain management models will provide for a new level of interaction between the industrial, commercial, transport and logistics companies based on global information transparency, mutual trust, transaction security. Owing to immaturity of the technology and lack of enough the successful implemented projects risks of its implementation in SCM system considerably increase. Generating a balanced strategy for the integration of the blockchain technology in supply chain management is a promising area of research. This process assumes forming and the analysis of the possible strategic alternatives considering the synthetic nature of the concept of SCM, diversity of use of blockchain technology, uncertainty and risks. Development of alternative strategies is a result of the implementation of a systematic approach to carrying out comprehensive studies of external and internal factors, the relationships between them, in the assessment of opportunities and potential threats.

AB This work(1) studies the problem of automatically penalizing intentional or unintentional data breach (APB) by a receiver/custodian receiving confidential data from a sender. We solve this problem for multimedia data by augmenting a blockchain on-chain smart contract between the sender and receiver with an off-chain cryptographic protocol, such that any significant data breach from the receiver is penalized through a monetary loss. Towards achieving the goal, we use an oblivious transfer scheme when used with a robust watermarking and a claim-or-refund blockchain contract provides the necessary framework to realize the APB protocol in a provably secure manner. In our APB protocol, a public data breach by the receiver leads to her Bitcoin (or other blockchain) private signing key getting revealed to the sender, which allows him to penalize the receiver by claiming the deposit from the claim-or-refund contract. Interestingly, the protocol also ensures that the malicious sender cannot steal the deposit, even as he knows the original multimedia document or releases it in any form.

AB Data is central to the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Most of the current IoT systems are using centralized cloud-based data sharing systems. Involvement of such third-party service provider requires also trust from both sensor owner and sensor data user. Moreover, the fees need to be paid for their services. To tackle both the scalability and trust issues and to automatize the payments, this paper presents a blockchain based proxy re-encryption scheme. The system stores the IoT data in a distributed cloud after encryption. To share the collected IoT data, the system establishes runtime dynamic smart contracts between the sensor and the data user without the involvement of a trusted third party. It also uses an efficient proxy re-encryption scheme which allows that the data is only visible by the owner and the person present in the smart contract. The proposed system is implemented in an Ethereum based testbed to analyze the performance and security properties.

TI Visual and User-Defined Smart Contract Designing System Based on
   Automatic Coding
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Smart contract applications based on Ethereum blockchain have been widely used in many fields. They are developed by professional developers using specialized programming languages like solidity. It requires high requirements on knowledge of the specialized field and the proficiency in contract programming Thus, it is hard for normal users to design a usable smart contract based on their own demands. Most current studies about smart contracts focus on the security of coding while lack of friendly tools for users to design the specialized templates of contracts coding. This paper provides a visual and user-defined smart contract designing systems. It makes the development of domain-specific smart contracts simpler and visualization for contract users. The system implements the domain-specific features extraction about the crawled data sets of smart contract programs by TF-IDF and K-means++ clustering algorithm. Then, it achieves the automatic generation of unified basic function codes by Char-RNN (improved by LSTM) based on the domain-specific features. The system adopts Google Blockly and links the generated codes with UI controls. Finally, it provides a set of specialized templates of basic functions for users to design smart contracts by the friendly interface. It reduces the difficulty and costs of contract programming. The paper offers a case study to design contracts by users. The designed contracts were validated on the existing system to implement the food trading and traders' credit evaluation. The experimental results show that the designed smart contracts achieve good integration with the existing system and they can be deployed and compiled successfully.

AB Distributed ledgers have received significant attention as a building block for cryptocurrencies and have proven to be also relevant in several other fields. In cryptocurrencies, this abstraction is usually implemented by grouping transactions in blocks that are then linked together to form a blockchain. Nodes need to exchange information to maintain the status of the chain but this process consumes significant network resources. Unfortunately, naively reducing the number of messages exchanged can have a negative impact in performance and correctness, as some transactions might not be included in the chain.
   In this paper, we study the mechanisms of information dissemination used in Bitcoin and propose a set of adaptive mechanisms that lower network resource usage. Our experimental evaluation shows that is possible to lower the bandwidth consumed by 10.2% and the number of exchanged messages in 41.5%, without any negative impact in the number of transactions committed.

AB The need for sensors to deliver, communicate, collect, alert, and share information in various applications has made wireless sensor networks very popular. However, due to its limited resources in terms of computation power, battery life and memory storage of the sensor nodes, it is challenging to add security features to provide the confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Blockchain technology ensures security and avoids the need of any trusted third party. However, applying Blockchain in a resource-constrained wireless sensor network is a challenging task because Blockchain is power, computation, and memory hungry in nature and demands heavy bandwidth due to control overheads. In this paper, a new routing and a private communication Blockchain framework is designed and tested with Constant Bit rate (CBR). The proposed Load Balancing Multi-Hop (LBMH) routing shares and enhances the battery life of the Cluster Heads and reduce control overhead during Block updates, but due to limited storage and energy of the sensor nodes, Blockchain in sensor networks may never become a reality unless computation, storage and battery life are readily available at low cost.

AB Access control is one of the fundamental security mechanisms of IT systems. Most existing access control schemes rely on a centralized party to manage and enforce access control policies. As decentralized ledger technologies, especially permissioned networks, find more applicability beyond cryptocurrencies in enterprise solutions is expected that the security requirements will increase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an access control system that works in a decentralized environment without compromising the unique features of a decentralized ledger. Decentralized ledger based access control schemes have been proposed but have limitations such as lack of capability to protect the access history and detect/tolerate malicious participants. In order to address these concerns, we propose a novel decentralized ledger based access control system that utilizes cryptography. The newly proposed system is flexible and works with various storage system. The proposed system also provides verifiability for end users to detect compromised nodes in the decentralized ledger and high level privacy. We implement the scheme using Hyperledger Fabric and give detailed information of the prototype, and also assess its performance to show that it is practical for real world applications.

AB The majority of E-commerce transactions reveal private information such as customer's identity, order contents and payment information during the transaction. Other personal information such as health conditions, religion, and even ethnicity may be also deduced. Even when deploying electronic cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, anonymity cannot be fully guaranteed. Also, many anonymous payment schemes suffer from possible double spending circumstances. E-commerce privacy is basically a difficult problem as it involves parties with concurring interests. Three major e-commerce requirements are highly difficult to resolve: anonymous purchase, anonymous delivery and anonymous payment. This work presents a possible e-commerce system addressing all three anonymity requirements for electronic-items business on open networks. The system offers anonymous entities authentication mechanisms up to completing a fair anonymous e-commerce transaction. The system is based on deploying a physically clone-resistant hardware token for each relevant involved party. The tokens are made clone-resistant by accommodating a Secret Unknown Cipher (SUC) in each hardware-token as a digital PUF-like identity. A set of novel generic system-setups for units, protocols and e-commerce schemes is introduced. The proposed anonymization is basically attained by virtually-replacing relevant e-commerce entities by low-cost, unique and clone-resistant tokens/units using SUCs. The units act as trustable anonymous, authenticated and non-replaceable entities monitored by their acting users.

AB Companies are eager to invest in the emerging blockchain technology, but often fail to integrate this technology into real-world business applications that go beyond cryptocurrencies or pure demonstrators. The reason often lies in specific requirements related to data security and privacy. Current blockchain solutions are not able to meet these requirements, preventing a broad adoption of blockchain technology in business applications. To tackle this problem, we introduce UBI: a Universal Blockchain Integrator. UBI acts as a middleware between a company's legacy IT infrastructure and off-the-shelf blockchain solutions. UBI enriches the functionality of these solutions so that they meet specific security and privacy requirements. Its successful implementation shows the feasibility of the proposed solution. First evaluation results demonstrate its potential for real-world business applications.

AB The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) over the last five years has been sizeable. The scale of changes has ranged from connected domestic appliances to connected cities; the scope for IoT has expanded. Most of the major vendors; including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, now offer various devices to control aspects of homes. The issues surrounding IoT devices include security, vendors have not considered security when creating the devices and most users do not consider security when connecting the devices to home networks. This research focuses on an example of malware that attacks Raspberry Pi devices on the internet. The paper discusses the severity of a large-scale attack performed on the Internet of Things (IoT). A honeypot set up to capture different forms of malware obtained multiple samples from several unrelated IP addresses without any regular pattern. This paper addresses an analysis of the malware and how it infects new devices across the internet. The results show that the misconfiguration of Pi based IoT devices can lead to exploitation very rapidly and that malware can spread easily across a network, to infect all devices on the network.

   Designs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Hash functions are a crucial tool in a large variety of applications, ranging from security protocols to cryptocurrencies down to the Internet-of-Things devices used, for example, as biomedical appliances. In particular, SHA-2 is today a ubiquitous hashing primitive. Its acceleration has driven a wealth of contributions in the technical literature and even a whole industry segment involving dedicated hash processing accelerators. Because of the variety of requirements in terms of performance, resources, and energy consumption as well as the impact of the particular hardware technology of choice, evaluating and comparing different architectural schemes is a nontrivial task, along with the exploration of new solutions matching given user requirements. Based on a careful review of the state of the art, this paper introduces an SHA-2 workbench to be used as a framework for evaluating different implementation styles and architectural choices. The workbench comes in the form of a generic HDL description, where the various implementation options are exposed in the form of user-configurable parameters and can be variously combined obtaining either known solutions or possibly new configurations to be explored. We systematically use the workbench to analyze the available SHA-2 architectural techniques. This extensive evaluation provides a deep understanding of the performance and energy implications of each implementation style and even allows the identification of nonobvious matches between architectural choices and target technologies in order to optimize hash rate and area efficiency figures.

AB Blockchain Technology has been proposed to tackle author, centrality and storage issues. It converts centralized applications into dynamic distributed ones. Many researchers have proposed protocols and applications for mapping the old central applications into blockchain based distributed application. In this work, new system framework for Public World Wide Used Motor Vehicle History Reporting System, named CarChain, is proposed and designed. The new framework has not been constructed based on any of the popular well-known public blockchain networks. The framework constructs a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network that broadcasts transactions as any end system multicasting system in P2P live streaming applications. The framework allows car owners, repairing companies and insurance agencies to register and add new histories for cars in a simple method. Four different smart contracts control block updates in CarChain. In addition, database technology has been leveraged to cache intermediate data. We show in this paper the challenges and research opportunities that encounter blockchain based applications, such as CarChain.

AB Democracy in the digital age has attracted a lot of public attention in recent years. However, bringing the human right of secrecy in voting to electronic systems is difficult. Properties, such as the possibility of verifying universally that any vote counted was indeed carrying the decision made by a voter, are often conflicting and a trade-off must be found. This paper proposes a blockchain-based electronic voting system providing explicitly cast-as-intended verifiability. By using a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge any voter can verify that his or her encrypted vote represents the decision voted for while maintaining at the same time the secrecy of the ballot. In addition, any required cryptographic material can be generated in linear time with respect to the number of voters, making the system suitable for large scale elections, thus scalable.

AB Financial Technology (FinTech) is considered a taxonomy that describes a wide range of ICT (information and communications technology) associated with financial transactions and related operations. Improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including block chain based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other FinTech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering. This paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process. With a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation. The idea of adapted stochastic process is essential for the stabilizer, too.

AB We present a path starting from generalized information measures to blockchain applications. In the middle of these two endpoints, we derive the alpha-EM algorithm and the traditional log-EM algorithm simultaneously from a sole divergence. Thus, there are three subjects. The first part discusses the relationship between the Bregman divergence and the probabilistic alpha-divergence. There, a new alpha-divergence is derived from the Bregman divergence by skewing the probability space. In the second part, both the alpha-EM algorithm and the traditional log-EM algorithm are derived simultaneously from this single divergence. The third part is on the applications to the blockchain. The EM families are effective in statistical machine learning that can be incorporated in miners of blockchains for evaluating the data sent from clients. Any miner appreciates the speed in order to contest with other miners. The alpha-EM matches this purpose because of its faster speed than the log-EM. As a concrete application, we present the wine sommelier evaluation. This formulation using the multinomial mixture distribution can be applicable to a wider class of IoT data that fly on the network.

TI Bitcoin Mining Using Maxeler DataFlow Computers
SO EXPLORING THE DATAFLOW SUPERCOMPUTING PARADIGM: EXAMPLE ALGORITHMS FOR
   SELECTED APPLICATIONS
SE Computer Communications and Networks Series
AB Bitcoin, which is known as the world's first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network and cryptocurrency, introduced a decentralized mining process, where miners compete in confirming transactions in order to earn a certain amount of digital coins (bitcoins). Bitcoin mining is a repetitive and highly parallelizable process, and thus suitable for parallel computing. In this chapter, we present Maxeler dataflow paradigm as a form of parallel computing to process big data with low energy consumption and explain our dataflow implementation of the bitcoin mining algorithm for Maxeler MAX2B and MAX5C dataflow computers. With our dataflow design, we achieved up to 102 times faster and up to 256 times more energy-efficient bitcoin mining compared to standard multicore CPUs (Central Processing Units). While Maxeler dataflow computers are not able to compete against ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) bitcoin mining rigs in terms of hash rate and energy efficiency, they are flexible and can be reprogrammed to do other tasks, while ASIC mining rigs are fixed (running only one specific algorithm) and usually become outdated in a few months.

AB As a basic building block of the smart grid, advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is substantial for gathering and sending consumption and production data of consumers. The applications facilitated by blockchain technology like local peer to peer (P2P) markets challenge the centrally organized utility industry with its disruptive potential and rely also heavily on AMIs as data source. However, such technologies pose a number of engineering challenges in early stage pilot projects: Unlike centrally managed AMIs, local P2P markets in particular require AMIs to exchange data with their peer devices, which increases the communication requirements due to the decentral nature of blockchain networks. In this paper, we compare the bandwidth requirement of real-time AMI with the requirements for a blockchain managed peer to peer market. By benchmarking both a normal operation and a high throughput scenario we find a ten times higher demand in bandwidth of the blockchain-based solution compared to real-time AMI and select the appropriate communication technology for an upcoming field test.

TI Storage Mechanism Optimization in Blockchain System Based on Residual
   Number System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Huge storage volume is one of the main bottlenecks for the development of blockchain, so how to release the burden by optimizing the storage mechanism has become an important problem. Most of the current solutions would modify the architecture of blockchain, which weakens the characteristics of the decentralization, such as cloud storage. In this paper, a storage optimization mechanism based on residual number system is proposed to reduce the storage volume on each node. In addition, the recovery procedure of CRT-II (The new Chinese Remainder Theorem) is used to detect garbled data from devil nodes, which enable the proposed storage mechanism with strong fault tolerance capability. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results prove the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed scheme.

AB Number of internet connected devices is increasing as IoT is getting more prevalent. Volume of data collected by IoT sensors is very high and requires considerable resources for data processing like analytics. Edge processing enables getting the sensor data processed closer to the source. It's not always possible and/or economical to set up a resource intense infrastructure at the edge. This paper proposes use of blockchain based decentralized application to enable IoT edge processing. With this setup, it is possible for a resource owner to join the ecosystem and to lend the compute resources as needed. IoT devices can offload some of the edge computation to the resource owner nodes as and when required. This paper explains architectural components and overall solution for implementation. Based on the usecase of video analytics at edge, experimental setup is implemented for the IoT edge solution using hyperledger sawtooth blockchain.

AB Sustainable and socially responsible investment (SRI) strategies face high growth rates worldwide. Although SRI strategies gained high amounts of assets under management over the last years, we do not recognize a significant shift towards sustainable business practices. The research aim of this paper is to give an answer to the question, why the high amount of assets managed sustainably does not lead to a significant transformation in business practices and how we could change the existing framework in order to achieve significant changes. Our methodological approach first leads us to a comparison of the existing seven sustainable investment strategies and a description of financial instruments, connected with those strategies. Second, we collect decision criteria and goals for supply side and demand side market participants. Finally, we use this preparatory work for the construction of a decision matrix, which allows us to interpret differences in goal fulfilments.
   This analysis delivers insights into the connection between sustainable investment strategies, preferences of supply side and demand side institutions, and the low speed of transformation. Up to now, no research on the connection between sustainable investment strategies and the speed of transformation towards sustainability has been done. Our results focus cost disadvantages of impact investing compared to other sustainable investment strategies. A stronger standardisation of impact investing's private debt and private equity structures is needed. The legislator could favour impact investing to other investment strategies, as current law is based on less efficient investment strategies. A blockchain application could additionally drive down the costs and increase the flexibility of impact investing.

AB Blockchain technology enables the operation of fully decentralized applications without the need for a central authority to manage the execution of the underlying process. However, a critical limitation in the technology today is the inability for such applications to query information external to the blockchain. Applications must make use of a decentralized oracle, i.e. a trusted source of external information. In this work we propose the paired-question decentralized oracle protocol, designed to extract true answers from the public. When querying the oracle, a user submits pairs of antithetic questions and voting users answer them for the chance to receive rewards. This new protocol lends itself to a simple formal analysis, and it is shown to strongly incentivize a Nash equilibrium of truthful reporting. This paper also discusses a number of extensions to the base protocol to improve its cost-effectiveness, security, and applicability.

AB In this article, we highlight a novel solution for densifying 5G access networks. Taking benefits from local actors and prosumers, our proposal allows offering a better connectivity to end-users in a model involving network operators and a crowd of local actors. We show that building a multi-actors and densified access network infrastructure has become possible in a distributed way. Incumbent actors with a large footprint act as trusted partners securing the infrastructure and providing guarantees, while the crowd of local actors deploys multiple access points and are rewarded for their contribution. Rewarding is possible thanks to a distributed Bandwidth & Identity ledger along with a Proof of Bandwidth (PoB) mechanism. This article presents the main principles of this new connectivity platform, BALAdIN (Bandwidth Ledger AccountIng Networks), which relies on a consortium blockchain with access control mechanisms removing communitarian Wifi and ad hoc networks drawbacks. Indeed, combining distributed ledgers and edge networks allows local actors to cooperate with trusted parties, which leverages the full potential of multi-actors access networks.

AB Over the past few decades, the automation of inter-organizational processes has been the focus of several research efforts that have produced a broad spectrum of design methods and technologies. Recently, some experiments have shown how in principle a Decentralized Autonomous Process-Aware Information System (DAIS) can be implemented by means of Blockchain-based Smart Contracts (BSCs). In this paper, we cast a shadow on this novel approach by arguing that such kind of contracts cannot be considered an optimal abstraction to specify inter-organizational process models. We base our analysis on contractual incompleteness, a pivotal concept in widely accepted economic theories. We identify the main weakness in the conflict between the immutability-by-default of the BSCs and the nature of inter-organizational processes. As a result of this analysis, we introduce the concept of enforceable business process that is more in line with the original idea of smart contract and extends it to better match the essential requirements of a DAIS.

We propose to use a new technology, BlockChain (BC), and a revived technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), to build IT-based tools for financial confirmation and diagnosis. We describe first the mechanisms for both, confirmation and diagnosis. Then, the type of computation involved is analysed. The two technologies involved in our proposal, BC and AI, are computationally intensive. The time and energy involved cannot be minimized using off-the-shelf solutions. Finally, the architectural environment for an efficient implementation is proposed and evaluated. The paper represents the description of our proposed approach to solve critical problems affecting the current financial systems.

Rice quality traits mainly include fat content, fatty acid composition, protein content and amino acid composition. The average content of essential amino acids in rice was 7.3%, accounting for 28.4% of total amino acids. In this paper, the authors analyze the fatty protein nutrition of rice and application of block chain in three rural areas. By combining the technical characteristics of block chain with traditional agricultural production, agricultural intellectualization based on block chain technology can be built to ensure the accuracy, uniqueness and traceability of information, such as accurate identification of poverty alleviation households. At the same time, through the combination of artificial intelligence technology, we can predict the growth trend of crops, intelligently optimize the planting process, and thus build an intelligent agricultural service system.

This type of evidence is routinely produced as business records under U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence for use in the emerging discipline of Forensic Cell Site Analysis. The research was undertaken to determine if evidence produced by operators should be classified as digital evidence and, if so, what evidence handling methodologies are appropriate to ensure evidence integrity. This research project resulted in the creation of a method of determining if business records produced by MNO/MVNO organizations are digital evidence and whether evidentiary integrity is maintained in the conveyance of evidence between MNO/MVNO records custodians, law enforcement investigators and attorneys in criminal and civil cases. Block-chain based Distributed Ledger Technology was examined as a feasible evidence integrity maintenance solution.

We apply Jackson network model on the whole Bitcoin network where individual nodes operate as priority M/G/1 queuing systems. Data arrival process to the nodes is modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson process in which the data arrival rates to the nodes are derived from the analytical model of gossip data delivery protocol. This model considers random probability distribution of node connectivity. Performance results include network distribution time for blocks, node response time for blocks, and populations of data distribution algorithms as functions on network size. Usefulness of this model is demonstrated by efficiently computing the forking probability for the Bitcoin blockchain.

In cooperative model, members are empowered to govern their own organizations and electing its members to assume roles in governance structure need verification of their eligibilities. This process needs transparent validation of their eligibility and it is argued that block chain architecture would be helpful. In this paper, a conceptual framework is presented to relate E-Governance to block chain to explore feasibility of relating to efficient governance by bringing more transparency. In order to explore this, dairy cooperative sector is taken up and E-Governance services are assessed with service oriented architecture framework. Case of dairy cooperative society union is taken up to apply this conceptual framework and understand feasibility applying block chain principles.

AB dAppER is to provide an automated quality assurance mechanism for the internal procedures put in place for the production of exam papers and their respective assessment schemes. Higher Education Providers (HEP) in the UK, or for that matter Universities worldwide, have a duty to meet the quality standards and requirements set out in their respective curricula and programme specifications. Such requirements usually include internal moderation of unseen examination papers and independent review by an external examiner to ensure necessary checks have taken place. These checks are likely to be scrutinised during audit trails. Permissioned blockchain facilitates the secure distribution of the exam paper, whilst maintaining an immutable and trusted ledger for audits. The system allows transparency that is ideal for External Examiners and Auditors to view. A prototype was developed using HyperLedger and implemented on three mock exam papers. The results demonstrate that dAppER can be successfully implemented and provide some insights into whether the development of decentralised applications complements quality assurance systems in general.

AB The rise of blockchain technology has paved the way for an increasing number of blockchain systems, each having different characteristics. The need for distributed applications that span across multiple blockchain systems is increasing. However, it is currently not possible to write a single-description smart contract which can be compiled to span across multiple blockchain systems.
   In this paper we present PORTHOS, a macroprogramming framework and domain specific language for writing commitment-based smart contracts that span multiple blockchain systems. The language allows programmers to write smart contracts at a higher level of abstraction by composing together contract blocks, without the need to specify how logic should be split across different blockchain instances. A runtime framework, including both on-chain and off-chain functionality, harmonises the features of different blockchain systems as well as enables communication across the smart contracts. A proof of concept, built on the Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchain systems and extendible to other systems, illustrates the technique and framework. We also show how the PORTHOS language is expressive enough to define a variety of applications.

   DEVELOPMENT OF ICT
SE Studies in Computational Intelligence
AB The research is aimed at setting and studying the criminal measures to protect relationships in the field of blockchain functioning and cryptocurrency turnover and at formulating proposals to adjust relevant criminal regulations to the current level of the development of information technologies. The methodology contains formal-legal methods and comparative law techniques, as well as logical and systematic ways of interpretation of rules and regulations. The results: The investigation reveals that Articles 272 and 273 of the RF's Criminal Code as presently in force don't admit of applying these measures to individuals committing the given crimes for the purpose of affecting information and telecommunication networks and points out that definite regulations related to computerized data crimes take into account neither a dramatic increase in crime danger to the public in the area of blockchain functioning and cryptocurrency turnover nor the identity of criminals of a relevant category. The conclusion proposes the following amendments: (1) to edit both Part 1 Article 272 and Part 1 Article 273 of the RF's Criminal Code in order to eliminate the aforementioned neglected issues; (2) to assign the status of a qualifying element: (a) to the way of committing a crime in the area of computerized data in relation to the intervention in the operation of information and telecommunication networks (Part 2 Article 1596); (b) to the effect after unauthorized access to the computerized data by way of intervening in the information and telecommunication network (Part 2 Article 272 of the RF's Criminal Code); (c) to the target of crime (Part 2 Article 273 of the RF's Criminal Code), i.e., the creation, use and distribution of malware aimed to intervene in the operation of information and telecommunication networks; (3) to amend Part 1 Article 63 of the RF's Criminal Code by inserting a new section "committing a crime with the use of specific knowledge and (or) special skills".

AB the blockchain is an emerging technology with a core of a distributed ledger of connected blocks consisting of immutable transactions with decentralized management. The importance of blockchain technology and its impact in different domains highlights the need for understanding and evaluation of this technology. Understanding and evaluating technology from different aspects requires identifying the characteristics and specific criteria of that technology. In this regard, in this paper, after discussing the subject literature, the concept of the blockchain platform is described and a number of selected blockchain platforms are examined. Besides, the high-level benchmarking of the platform is evaluated from two aspects of the expected features of the platforms and their architectural components. Finally, due to the importance and significance of the criteria and their frequency, a set of effective criteria is chosen and accordingly, selected platforms of the blockchain are analyzed.

This study introduces a novel distributed control system using the Blockchain. A multi-robot path planning application is developed and deployed to benchmark a blockchain platform, the Hyperledger Fabric. Blockchain technology has the reputation of being sufficiently dilatory that it is inappropriate for time-sensitive applications. This research demonstrates how the enterprise-grade blockchain solutions overcome this shortcoming and investigates their potential for enabling secure and trusted distributed control systems for IoT.

AB Distributed ledger/blockchain has emerged as an important technology that can have a significant impact on the management of supply chains. This paper investigates the feasibility of adopting blockchain technology in both manufacturing and perishable goods supply chains. Two cases are used to illustrate the approach proposed in this work. The first case addresses the use of blockchain technology in the supply chain of composite materials in order to facilitate the certification process of components made of carbon fiber employed in the aerospace sector. The second case investigates the feasibility of adopting blockchain technology in the supply chain of live seafood. In the first case blockchain technology has the potential to be used by industry peers to perform experimental validation tests including flammability, crashworthiness, operational, etc. Additionally in both cases blockchain technology can be used for transportation, handling and storage, not to mention tamper proof checks, product history and provenance tracking.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain is the underlying technology of a number of digital cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is a chain of blocks that store information with digital signatures in a decentralized and distributed network. The features of blockchain, including decentralization, immutability, transparency and auditability, make transactions more secure and tamper proof. Apart from cryptocurrency, blockchain technology can be used in financial and social services, risk management, healthcare facilities, and so on. A number of research studies focus on the opportunity that blockchain provides in various application domains. This paper presents a comparative study of the tradeoffs of blockchain and also explains the taxonomy and architecture of blockchain, provides a comparison among different consensus mechanisms and discusses challenges, including scalability, privacy, interoperability, energy consumption and regulatory issues. In addition, this paper also notes the future scope of blockchain technology.

AB In drone environments using batteries, it is important to reduce unnecessary overhead. Also, for security of data, encryption is also an important factor. However, in the case of encryption, overhead is generated, but encryption and overhead are always in a trade-off relationship in this way. In this paper, in order to reduce overhead of drone, the concept of reliability was applied. We applied low level security to drone with high reliability to reduce overhead and conversely applied high level security to drone with low reliability. In order to adjust the security level, adjust the size of Key used for encryption and reduce the weight of the security algorithm itself. The reliability of the drone was determined based on the number of times of receiving data and by applying group reliability through drone grouping, it was made possible to determine hierarchical reliability. Moreover, by storing the communication records of all drones in the blockchain, the integrity of the reliability is guaranteed.

AB The Blockchain technology has been one of the major innovations in recent years. Crypto-currencies and decentralized applications are increasingly adopted. Their principles led the foundation for new ideas underlying others distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). In particular, decentralized storage employs non-recursive functions and similar algorithms compared to the Blockchain technology. Furthermore, digital signatures procedures have been used for storage validation. This paper summarizes IPFS and Swarm technologies and exposes how we managed to hide our malware on distributed storage. Our demonstration's results illustrate the possibility to hide malicious content by segregating it and reveal that decentralized storages have many concerns and lack security verification procedures.

TI A Blockchain Enhanced Framework for Social Networking
SO LEDGER
AB Social networking sites have given users unprecedented opportunities for the generation and dissemination of content. A variety of social networking sites exist for different purposes, to afford users a range of anonymous and non-anonymous options for self-expression, and the ability to be a part of a virtual community. These "affordances" enable users to create and share content;(1,2) however, the ability to partially or wholly detach user identity from the content has resulted in unique challenges for content access and content attribution. This paper proposes a framework for secure, trustworthy social networking that also creates value for user-generated content by using a blockchain-enhanced framework for social networking. This work explains the application of such a framework for collocated spaces of robots and IoT devices and identifies key challenges that result as a consequence of merging social networking sites and blockchain technology.

AB Due to the immutable nature of distributed ledger technology such as blockchain, it is of utter importance that a smart contract works as intended before employment outside test network. This is since any bugs or errors will become permanent once published to the live network, and could lead to substantial economic losses; as manifested in the infamous DAO smart contract exploit hack in 2016. In order to avoid this, formal verification methods can be used to ensure that the contract behaves according to given specifications. This paper presents a survey of the state of the art of formal verification of smart contracts. Being a relatively new research area, a standard or best practice for formal verification of smart contracts has not yet been established. Thus, several different methods and approaches have been used to perform the formal verification. The survey presented in this paper shows that some variant of model checking or theorem proving methodology seems to be most successful. However, as of today, formal verification is only successful on simple contracts, and does not support more advanced smart contract syntax.

TI Securing Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad Hoc Network with Fog Node based
   Distributed Blockchain Cloud Architecture
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Cognitive radio, ad hoc networks' applications are continuously increasing in wireless communication globally. In vehicles' environment, cognitive radio technology with mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) enables vehicles to monitor the available channels and to effectively function in these frequencies through sharing ongoing information with drivers and different frameworks to enhance traffic safety on roads. To fulfill the computational storage resources' limitations of a specific vehicle, Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) is used by merging VANET with cloud computing. Cloud computing requires high security and protection because authenticate users and attackers have the same rights in VCC. The security is enhanced in CRVANETs, but the distributed nature of cloud unlocks a door for dissimilar attacks, such as trust modal, data security, connection fault and query tracking attacks. This paper proposes an effective and secured blockchain scheme-based distributed cloud architecture in place of conventional cloud architecture to secure the drivers' privacy with low cost and on-demand sensing procedure in CRVANETs ecosystem.

AB This paper proposes a bitcoin-based triangular arbitrage, combining foreign exchanges in the bitcoin market and reverse foreign exchange spot transactions. An FX futures contract is used to reduce exposure to risk as a hedging instrument. The returns of the portfolio are jointly modeled using a bivariate DCC-GARCH model with multivariate standardized student's t disturbances due to the presence of leptokurtosis and fat tails observed. Based on the time-dependent covariance matrix, a dynamic optimal hedge ratio is formed, with a conditional correlation series as a by-product. Empirical results are obtained using Euros and U.S. dollars over the period from 21 April 2014 to 21 September 2018. Multiple rolling one-step-ahead forecasts are generated. The empirical results present bitcoin-based currency strategies dominate bitcoin trading in terms of risk management.

AB Trusted collaboration satisfying the requirements of (a) adequate transparency and (b) preservation of privacy of business sensitive information is a key factor to ensure the success and adoption of online business-to-business (B2B) collaboration platforms. Our work proposes novel ways of stringing together game theoretic modeling, blockchain technology, and cryptographic techniques to build such a platform for B2B collaboration involving enterprise buyers and sellers who may be strategic. The B2B platform builds upon three ideas. The first is to use a permissioned blockchain with smart contracts as the technical infrastructure for building the platform. Second, the above smart contracts implement deep business logic which is derived using a rigorous analysis of a repeated game model of the strategic interactions between buyers and sellers to devise strategies to induce honest behavior from buyers and sellers. Third, we present a formal framework that captures the essential requirements for secure and private B2B collaboration, and, in this direction, we develop cryptographic regulation protocols that, in conjunction with the blockchain, help implement such a framework. We believe our work is an important first step in the direction of building a platform that enables B2B collaboration among strategic and competitive agents while maximizing social welfare and addressing the privacy concerns of the agents.

AB Blockchain technology has been devised from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much more full range of applications beyond serving as the platform for the digital cryptocurrency. Conceptually, a blockchain ( BC) is defined as a decentralized ledger that registers every transactional operation made in encrypted data format. The implementation of such concept bring about augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in the work environment dynamics from the current centralized structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of transactions by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an overview of BC technology and its applications in the AEC industry and its potential integration with the building information ( BIM) process. Furthermore, the study explores how BC technologies can improve the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper discusses the fundamental principles of distributed ledgers, their current applications and potential future advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. The study presents some examples the prospective application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the code compliance checking process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, possible directions, and future research directions.

AB MedRec is a simple, distributed system for personal control of identity and distribution of personal information. The work is done in the context of a medical information distribution system where patients retain control over who can access their data. We present a new architecture for the MedRec project, creating a network of trusted data repositories, the access to which are determined by a set of "smart contracts". These contracts are stored on a distributed ledger maintained by those who generate data. The distributed nature of the system allows unified access from diverse sources in a single application with no intermediary. This increases patient control while retaining a measure of privacy of both data content and source. MedRec is amenable to extensions for decentralized messaging and distribution of information to third parties such as medical researchers, healthcare proxies, and other institutions. The system is based on a blockchain that contains smart contracts defining user identity and distribution specifics.

TI Choice of law for property issues regarding Bitcoin under English law
SO JOURNAL OF PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW
AB The dominant recent legal discourse concerning Bitcoin and later virtual currencies has been focused on regulatory issues such as anti-money laundering and financial and securities regulation. By contrast, scant attention has been given to the intersection between the uses of Bitcoin and commercial law even as its popularity has grown as both an asset class and as a means of payment for goods and services. In determining the commercial law consequences of transactions involving Bitcoin, the likely cross-border nature of Bitcoin-related transactions will give rise to choice of law issues which may have a determinative effect on a given dispute. Commercial disputes involving virtual currencies have already made their way into common law courts. This paper examines one of the most significant choice of law problems that arises - the law applicable to determine disputes concerning property in Bitcoins (and determining the situs of Bitcoins) through the lens of English conflict of laws.

AB To ensure that the data aggregation, data storage, and data processing are all performed in a decentralized but trusted manner, we propose to use the blockchain with the mining pool to support IoT services based on cognitive radio networks. As such, the secondary user can send its sensing data, i.e., transactions, to the mining pools. After being verified by miners, the transactions are added to the blocks. However, under the dynamics of the primary channel and the uncertainty of the mempool state of the mining pool, it is challenging for the secondary user to determine an optimal transaction transmission policy. In this paper, we propose to use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive an optimal transaction transmission policy for the secondary user. Specifically, we adopt a Double Deep-Q Network (DDQN) that allows the secondary user to learn the optimal policy. The simulation results clearly show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning algorithm outperforms the conventional Q-learning scheme in terms of reward and learning speed.

TI Towards Optimal Implementation of Decentralized Currencies: How to Best
   Select Probabilities in an Ethereum-Type Proof-of-Stake Protocol
SO THAI JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS
AB Nowadays, most financial transactions are based on a centralized system, when all the transaction records are stored in a central location. This centralization makes the financial system vulnerable to cyber-attacks. A natural way to make the financial system more robust and less vulnerable is to switch to decentralized currencies. Such a transition will also make financial system more transparent. Historically first currency of this type - bitcoin - use a large amount of electric energy to mine new coins and is, thus, not scalable to the level of financial system as a whole. A more realistic and less energy-consuming scheme is provided by proof-of-stake currencies, where the right to mint a new coin is assigned to a randomly selected user, with probability depending of the user's stake (e.g., his/her number of coins). What probabilities should we choose? In this paper, we find the probability selection that provides the optimal result - optimal in the sense that it is the least inductive to cheating.

AB With the development of decentralized consensus protocols, permissionless blockchains have been envisioned as a promising enabler for the general-purpose transaction-driven, autonomous systems. However, most of the prevalent blockchain networks are built upon the consensus protocols under the crypto-puzzle framework known as proof-of-work. Such protocols face the inherent problem of transaction-processing bottleneck, as the networks achieve the decentralized consensus for transaction confirmation at the cost of very high latency. In this paper, we study the problem of consensus formation in a system of multiple throughput-scalable blockchains with sharded consensus. Specifically, the protocol design of sharded consensus not only enables parallelizing the process of transaction validation with sub-groups of processors, but also introduces the Byzantine consensus protocols for accelerating the consensus processes. By allowing different blockchains to impose different levels of processing fees and to have different transaction-generating rate, we aim to simulate the multi-service provision eco-systems based on blockchains in real world. We focus on the dynamics of blockchain-selection in the condition of a large population of consensus processors. Hence, we model the evolution of blockchain selection by the individual processors as an evolutionary game. Both the theoretical and the numerical analysis are provided regarding the evolutionary equilibria and the stability of the processors' strategies in a general case.

AB The mandate of citizens for more socially responsible information systems that respect privacy and autonomy calls for a computational and storage decentralization. Crowd-sourced sensor networks monitor energy consumption and traffic jams. Distributed ledgers systems provide unprecedented opportunities to perform secure peer-to-peer transactions using blockchain. However, decentralized systems often show performance bottlenecks that undermine their broader adoption: propagating information in a network is costly and time-consuming. Optimization of cost-effectiveness with supervised machine learning is challenging. Training usually requires privacy-sensitive local data, for instance, adjusting the communication rate based on citizens' mobility. This paper studies the following research question: How feasible is to train with privacy-preserving aggregate data and test on local data to improve cost-effectiveness of a decentralized system? Centralized machine learning optimization strategies are applied to DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service and they are compared to decentralized self-adaptive strategies that use local data instead. Experimental evaluation with a testing set of 2184 decentralized networks of 3000 nodes aggregating real-world Smart Grid data confirms the feasibility of a linear regression strategy to improve both estimation accuracy and communication cost, while the other optimization strategies show trade-offs.

AB Smart grids are gradually becoming popular, but itself, especially its power distribution grids, faces many security issues, and false data injection is one of the most attack that happens. Blockchain is considered a key technology for protecting IoT due to its decentralization, non-deformable and high scalability. However, the current blockchain technology costs lots of resources storing and producing blocks, it cannot be directly applied to the power distribution grids with a large number of resource-limited nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes historical chain compression, and then modifys the DPOS and applies it to the blockchain, which help reduce the storeage burden and improve the effiiciency of block producing.

AB Supply Chain Tracking (SCT) is considered as a major challenge for stakeholders of heterogeneous production, processing, transporting, storing, and selling systems. Studies on solutions in SCT reveal that many centralized SCT applications lack a design, which can support or even enable main features of a reliable, transparent, and publicly accessible SCT system for end users. This work demonstrates the implementation of a SCT application which, employs SC on the Ethereum blockchain (BC). This Decentralized Application (Dapp) provides a hardware-and platform-independent approach that flexibly enables multiple object combinations and transformations to be tracked with a use case-agnostic design and utilization.

AB Proof-of-Work (PoW) in Blockchains (BC), which is a widely used consensus algorithm, suffers from high power consumption of miners and low transaction rates. This work demonstrates a Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based BC called Bazo, which is specially designed and adapted for Internet of Things (IoT) data streams. Bazo displays enhanced performance in terms of energy consumption and transactions processing in comparison to PoW-based BC. To further improve performance of Bazo, sharding and transaction aggregation methods are employed. Moreover, IoT-BC adaptation helpers of a modular and layered architecture are provided to allow wireless devices to submit data into the BC. The designed architecture can support multiple hardware and software platforms as well as network technologies.

Third, our approach is especially scalable to ever growing smart infrastructures.

AB Currently, storing patient's sensitive data by medical healthcare into Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) has evolved immensely. Specifically, distributed healthcare records have brought ease to how hospitals and other different third parties access the sensitive medical health information of patients for various uses leading to generation of big data. Big data in healthcare is important as it can be used in the prediction of outcome of diseases, prevention of co-morbidities fatality and saving the cost of medical treatment. However, this has also made it easy for security breaches and privacy violations during the data collection process. In this paper, we propose a platform which uses the blockchain technology for privacy preservation during collection, management and distribution of EHR data. The aim of this paper is to ensure the total privacy, integrity and access control of distributed electronic health records to the data owners during its distribution on the blockchain. Simulated results demonstrate our proposed system establishes total transparency and ensures perfect privacy within the distributed network of sharing EHRs in the medical setting using the blockchain.

AB The payment of a subscription-based model for the cloud service is regularly operated with the association of the bank as a centralized trustful third party. This system taxes the parties involved by requiring them to pay high transaction costs to the bank. In this paper, we propose a protocol to enable Fixed Subscription and Pay As You Go Subscription payments in the cloud service without the use of the third party. We achieve this goal by decentralizing the payment with blockchain. In return, this decentralized system generates low transaction costs. We implement our idea in the form of two smart contracts in Ethereum network. We also evaluate the security properties of our protocol. Based on the performance analysis, we can argue that all of the operations in the smart contract produces reasonable gas costs and the contracts are usable in the real network.

AB The blockchain is currently under the spotlight of trending technologies. It adds security to private applications in several areas of knowledge, and its versatility results in the development of multiple frameworks to meet the requirements of each application. Thus, it is a key challenge to ensure that blockchain frameworks provide security, access control, and high performance to applications. In this paper, we evaluate two frameworks for blockchain development, Parity, and Multichain, which provide configuration and permission flexibility. Our evaluation is a comprehensive comparison between the frameworks, focusing on the analysis of transaction-validation time, transactionmining time, transaction-seek time and block-seek time. To this end, we deploy peer-to-peer private permissioned networks, in which the frameworks generate the blockchain applications. For each framework, we provide a realistic workload, based on the distribution of probability of interarrival time of transactions on the Bitcoin network. The results show that each framework stands out under specific criteria, and their design decisions imply restrictions on features that are critical for creating secure and efficient blockchain applications.

AB As of 2014, a fifth of EU citizens relied on cloud accounts to store their documents according to a Eurostat report. Although useful, there are downsides to the use of cloud documents. They often accumulate sensitive information over time, including financial information. This makes them attractive targets to cybercriminals. To understand what happens to compromised cloud documents that contain financial information, we set up 100 fake payroll sheets comprising 1000 fake records of fictional individuals. We populated the sheets with traditional bank payment information, cryptocurrency details, and payment URLs. To lure cybercriminals and other visitors into visiting the sheets, we leaked links pointing to the sheets via paste sites. We collected data from the sheets for a month, during which we observed 235 accesses across 98 sheets. Two sheets were not opened. We also recorded 38 modifications in 7 sheets. We present detailed measurements and analysis of accesses, modifications, edits, and devices that visited payment URLs in the sheets. Contrary to our expectations, bank payment URLs received many more clicks than cryptocurrency payment URLs despite the popularity of cryptocurrencies and emerging blockchain technologies. On the other hand, sheets that contained cryptocurrency details recorded more modifications than sheets that contained traditional banking information. In summary, we present a comprehensive picture of what happens to compromised cloud spreadsheets.

AB The concept of smart grid infrastructure is already being implemented and progressing rapidly. The number of countries are transforming the traditional power grid so that it will be able to maintain the smart grid requirements. Smart grid is known as an evolutionary power grid which is proposed to make intelligent decisions on its own based on a current state of electrical power system. Microgrid (MG) is a "building block" of smart grid which supposed to provide wider control capability into the system, thus allowing to operate without connection to the grid. However, the remote and autonomous control of the smart grid may result in problems related to security. The main purpose of this paper is to consider various application scenarios of the Blockchain technology in smart grid. The utmost example is smart contract feature. It allows to reduce cost and increase security of trading operations without including third parties. In other words, direct communication between seller and consumer is implemented. Particularly, paper explain how the security and resilience of the system can be improved by the application of Blockchain technology. Furthermore, decentralized machine-to-machine interaction scheme is proposed. First of all, auction based electricity trading platform is established in Jade platform, and further on electricity trading history is stored in blockchain. The proposed case study shows implementation possibility of smart contracts in smart grid environment.

AB In Blockchain networks involving multiple applications, the quality of service of an application is affected by the transaction ordering. We study a setting where each application is represented by a node, which might attempt to prioritize its own transactions through including them early in blocks added to the blockchain. A fair block proposal of a node follows a random selection of the transactions among the set of pending transactions the node is aware of. On the contrary, a dishonest node includes more of its transactions at the expense of transactions of other applications. In this work, we propose a toolbox of techniques to enforce such a fair block selection. First, we design an accurate statistical testing for the honesty of a proposal and explain it. Next, we describe a reputation system, documenting honesty of nodes to encourage fairness. Our last technique enforces fair block selection through concise commitments on the set of pending transactions known to a node.

AB The main and challenging evolutionary process that leads towards the so-called Smarter City is still represented by the optimization of the Intelligent Systems for the Quality of Life (QoL) and the Quality of Services (QoS), and by the integration of heterogeneous IT services and different networks. The scientific interest in this field consists of promoting innovative solutions by use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) able to collect, analyse and obtain value added from a large amount of data generated by several sources: IoT devices, sensor networks, wearable devices as well as sensor grids, widespread within the urban environment. Furthermore, creating synergies and integrating different enabling technologies and informative platforms, remains the most challenge to overcome in order to obtain the optimization of the services and the quality of life. The Smart City involves the implementation of digital strategies that are necessary people-centred and lead into high technology-based innovations to build more capacities and opportunities. In this context, this paper intends to investigate the possibility to integrate the innovative and multi-purpose Blockchain Technology in the smart city evolutionary process, and in particular in the Smart Environment and Smart Mobility by allowing renewable energy sources traceability and by providing information about the kind of energy used to refuel, for example, the selected vehicle. The expected result consists of more user awareness regarding the environmental and energy sustainability.

AB Driven by the surge of interest generated around blockchain technologies over the last years, a new category of systems, called Blockchain-Oriented Software (BOS), which are strictly tied to Blockchain distributed environment, has become increasingly popular. Yet, there is not a thorough understanding of their structure and behaviour and if and to which extent they differ from traditional software systems. The present work provide a first statistical characterisation of BOS. We analysed and compared 5 C++ open source Blockchain-Oriented and 5 Traditional Java software systems, aiming at detecting potential differences between the two categories of projects, and specifically in the statistical distribution of 10 software metrics. Although, in general, the statistical distributions for Traditional software and Blockchain software show similarities, the distribution of Average Cyclomatic and Ration Comment To Code metrics reveal significant differences in their queue, whereas the Number of Statements metric shows meaningful differences on the double Pareto distribution.

AB We introduce Graphene, a method and protocol for interactive set reconciliation among peers in blockchains and related distributed systems. Through the novel combination of a Bloom filter and an Invertible Bloom Lookup Table (IBLT), Graphene uses a fraction of the network bandwidth used by deployed work for one-and two-way synchronization. We show that, for this specific problem, Graphene is more efficient at reconciling n items than using a Bloom filter at the information theoretic bound. We contribute a fast and implementation-independent algorithm for parameterizing an IBLT so that it is optimally small in size and meets a desired decode rate with arbitrarily high probability. We characterize our performance improvements through analysis, detailed simulation, and deployment results for Bitcoin Cash, a prominent cryptocurrency. Our implementations of Graphene, IBLTs, and our IBLT optimization algorithm are all open-source code.

AB Internet of Thing devices (IoT devices) are often constrained in terms of computing, memory, storage, power, and network resources. This makes them ill-suited to operate as first-class citizens on a blockchain, such as Ethereum, preventing the IoT devices from attaining the security guarantees that are available to better resourced nodes that are able to operate as full, validating nodes on the blockchain. IoT devices may use so-called light protocols to interact with the blockchain with minimal resource requirements, but these protocols provide only probabilistic security guarantees. In this position paper, we propose a new mechanism where an operator of IoT devices is able to send a "ground truth state" to the devices via a new mechanism, which we call "decentralized beacons", enabling them to gain full security guarantees of the blockchain state.

AB With the spread of pragmatic approaches to blockchains and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), the need to operate securely across multiple DLTs has become apparent. The class of operations that span two or more DLTs is generally referred to as interledger. Various interledger approaches have been proposed, researched and taken into use, including for example, atomic cross-chain transactions, sidechains, bridging approaches, ledger-of-ledger structures, and layered value transfer protocols, such as the W3C Interledger Protocol (ILP).
   In this demonstration, we exemplify ongoing work in our research group at Aalto University. We demonstrate how a resource-constrained IoT device may be made able to interact with an "IoT-friendly" ledger, with an interledger gateway service bridging to a public permissionless ledger. The demo use case reflects a scenario where an IoT device advertizes a service that is available for anyone on the Internet, pending a successful and validated payment has been made on the Ethereum ledger. This demonstration shows how this can be accomplished in an auditable and secure manner across ledgers using hashed timelock agreements (HTLAs) to provide payment escrow.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency. It is secure as long as majority of the computational resources are with honest miners who follow the Bitcoin protocol. There has been several attacks on Bitcoin mining process in recent years. Selfish mining has been proposed by which miners can get more reward than their fair share. If 33% of the miners are follow the selfish mining strategy, then the Bitcoin system will no longer remain decentralized. We propose a new mining strategy called the Rational Mining, following which only 28% of miners are enough to make Bitcoin decentralized.
   We analyze the different strategies and show how a miner can choose a strategy to maximize its gain under different parameter selection.

AB A blockchain is a distributed ledger of records called as blocks. These blocks are linked using cryptographic hash. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. Consensus layer is the main layer in Blockchain Architecture, in which consensus protocol is configured to decide how new block is added in blockchain. Consensus algorithm solves the problem of trust in blockchain. Consensus algorithms can be classified into two classes. The first class is voting-based consensus, which requires nodes in the blockchain network to broadcast their results of mining a new block or transaction, before appending the block to blockchain. The second class is proof-based consensus, which requires the nodes joining the blockchain network to solve and mathematical puzzle to show that they are more eligible than the others to do the appending or mining work. Performance of blockchain can be increased with the use of suitable consensus algorithm. However, theory and data support for the selecting suitable consensus in private blockchain is very limited. This paper contributes theory and data used for selecting suitable consensus algorithm and would help researchers for further exploring of consensus in private blockchain environment.

AB The specification and enforcement of network-wide policies in a single administrative domain is common in today's networks and considered as already resolved. However, this is not the case for multi-administrative domains, e.g. among different enterprises. In such situation, new problems arise that challenge classical solutions such as PKIs, which suffer from scalability and granularity concerns. In this paper, we present an extension to Group-Based Policy -a widely used network policy languagefor the aforementioned scenario. To do so, we take advantage of a permissioned blockchain implementation (Hyperledger Fabric) to distribute access control policies in a secure and auditable manner, preserving at the same time the independence of each organization. Network administrators specify polices that are rendered into blockchain transactions. A LISP control plane (RFC 6830) allows routers performing the access control to query the blockchain for authorizations. We have implemented an end-to-end experimental prototype and evaluated it in terms of scalability and network latency.

AB The primary aim of this work is to create a program simulating a private distributed blockchain using the functional programming language Idris. This simulation is implemented such that a rock-paper-scissors game can be played between any two users of the blockchain via the use of smart contracts. Our motivation is to assert, using relevant features of Idris, that such an implementation possesses some of the accepted properties of blockchains. This paper first presents some differences between our implementation and most real-world blockchains. Next the Idris language and some of its features are discussed, focusing on how the language is used to implement the simulation. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing Idris instead of an imperative programming language are examined.

AB Trajectory data has been widely used in many urban applications. Sharing trajectory data with effective supervision is a vital task, as it contains private information of moving objects. However, malicious data users can modify trajectories in various ways to avoid data distribution tracking by the hashing-based data signatures, e.g., MD5. Moreover, the existing trajectory data protection scheme can only protect trajectories from either spatial or temporal modifications. Finally, so far there is no authoritative third party for trajectory data sharing process, as trajectory data is too sensitive.
   To this end, we propose a novel trajectory copyright protection scheme, which can protect trajectory data from comprehensive types of data modifications/attacks. Three main techniques are employed to effectively guarantee the robustness and comprehensiveness of the proposed data sharing scheme: 1) the identity information is embedded distributively across a set of sub-trajectories partitioned based on the spatio-temporal regions; 2) the centroid distance of the sub-trajectories is served as a stable trajectory attribute to embed the information; and 3) the blockchain technique is used as a trusted third party to log all data transaction history for data distribution tracking in a decentralized manner. Extensive experiments were conducted based on two real-world trajectory datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

AB As the benefits of blockchain become clear, in the past year we have witnessed an explosive growth in the use of blockchain based systems. However, as with any new technology, adoption of blockchain carries with it, as yet not widely known, risks that should be properly evaluated and understood prior to design and development. Given the purely distributed nature of blockchain, in which nodes can span continents, a key aspect in planning and designing blockchain systems which is not readily incorporated in a modern architect's vernacular is consideration of eventual consistency, system stability and scalability when designing blockchain based systems. This is compounded by the fact that, as yet, very few practical tools are available to help architects better understand and plan for the above. In this paper we introduce BlockSIM, a comprehensive and open source blockchain system simulation tool which can assist blockchain architects better evaluate the performance of planned private blockchain networks by running scenarios and decide the optimal system parameters suited for their purposes. We compare the results of our simulation with real blockchain networks and demonstrate that BlockSIM can be used effectively by architects of blockchain systems to plan and implement scalable, stable and resilient blockchain networks. Finally, we demonstrate via a real-life example how architects can apply BlockSIM to plan and design real-world blockchain systems.

AB Currently, blockchain data storage systems are considered promising for storing important information, including personal data. However, the requirements of modern legislation in various countries pose challenges to such systems, including the need to delete data at the request of users, which contradicts the very concept of the blockchain. One way to solve this problem is to use encryption. The paper presents the most powerful asymptotic estimates of the cardinality of sets of correlation-immune and (n,m,k)-resilient Boolean mappings that are used in the construction of stream encryption systems. Also, a recurrence relation is proved, allowing to calculate the number of (n,m,k)-resilient mappings for small values n, m and k.

TI Blockchain and Social Concepts: Exposure of the Problem Field
SO SOCIOLOGICESKOE OBOZRENIE
AB The article studies the influence of blockchain technology on the formation of semantic structures in the social world. The feature of this influence is that the usage of a decentralized distributed database challenges traditional forms of social interactions, serving as a catalyst for constituting social values without analogues in the social world. Because the concepts developed in classical social theory are used to describe these values, this requires an actualization of its thesaurus. In particular, the article studies the concepts of trust, responsibility, time, and mining in the context of the introduction of blockchain technology. Because the content of these concepts is open and developing, they are given the status of social concepts. The study uses the actor-network theory as a theoretical and methodological basis. It lets us abandon conventions of common knowledge, and shows that these concepts are semantic nodes which emerge as trails (or links to trails) of the configured actions of actor-actants. In conclusion, the studied concepts are proposed to be used with the following meanings: (1) trust is confidence in algorithmized certainty processes and the actions of communication participants, and is based on the guarantees provided by decentralized information systems and on restricting freedom by subjecting anonymous collective identities; (2) responsibility is the personal willingness of participants to take actions in conditions of uncertainty, and to compensate risks; (3) block-time is the own-time of the technology of blocking, which characterizes the state of the protocol for the external observer. For the internal observer, block-time is chronological, since it fixes the timeless stability of the algorithm which connects blocks with each other; (4) mining is a kind of economic activity based on the synthesis of cryptographic technologies and the perception of archaic ideas about risk, luck, and wealth.

AB Distributed credit networks, such as Ripple [19] and Stellar [23], are becoming popular as an alternative means for financial transactions. However, the current designs do not preserve user privacy or are not truly decentralized. In this paper, we explore the creation of a distributed credit network that preserves user and transaction privacy and unlinkability. We propose BlAnC, a novel, fully decentralized blockchain-based credit network where credit transfer between a sender-receiver pair happens on demand. In BlAnC, multiple concurrent transactions can occur seamlessly, and malicious network actors that do not follow the protocols and/or disrupt operations can be identified efficiently.
   We perform security analysis of our proposed protocols in the universal composability framework to demonstrate its strength, and discuss how our network handles operational dynamics. We also present preliminary experiments and scalability analyses.

AB Across the world, the organisation and operation of the electricity markets is quickly changing, moving towards decentralised, distributed, renewables-based generation with real-time data exchange-based solutions. In order to support this change, blockchain-based distributed ledgers have been proposed for implementation of peer-to-peer energy trading platform. However, blockchain solutions suffer from scalability problems as well as from delays in transaction confirmation. This paper explores the feasibility of using IOTA's DAG-based block-free distributed ledger for implementation of energy trading platforms. Our agent-based simulation research demonstrates that an IOTA-like DAG-based solution could overcome the constraints that blockchains face in the energy market. However, to be usable for peer-to-peer energy trading, even DAG-based platforms need to consider specificities of energy trading markets (such as structured trading periods and assured confirmation of transactions for every completed period).

AB We propose a novel proof of delivery (PoD) mechanism to incentivize peers to participate in peer-to-peer content delivery services in a secure and effective fashion. By analyzing transaction records on a blockchain, the PoD can detect a fraudulent peer which does not pay for its content retrieval. Moreover, the PoD can enhance the delivery performance of a trustworthy peer by substantiating the notion of a trust window, whose size is proportional to the trustworthiness of a peer. That is, a trustworthy peer will experience enhanced delivery performance while a fraudulent one will be isolated from the network, which is checked by simulation results.

TI Nodes in the Bitcoin Network: Comparative Measurement Study and Survey
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has gained significant attention and growth in recent years. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin does not rely on a centralized authority to control the supply, distribution, and verification of the validity of transactions. Instead, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of volunteers to distribute pending transactions and confirmed blocks, to verify transactions, and to collectively implement a replicated ledger that everyone agrees on. This P2P network is at the heart of Bitcoin and many other blockchain technologies. In this paper, we present a comparative measurement study of nodes in the Bitcoin network. We measure and analyze how many the so-called "volunteers" are in the Bitcoin P2P network by scanning the live Bitcoin network for 37 days in 2018 and compare them with the data reported by prior work in 2013 similar to 2016. This paper is motivated by the fact that Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth in terms of a number of users, transactions, value, and interest over a recent couple of years. Our investigation includes the IP addresses of Bitcoin nodes, size of the network, power law in the geographic distribution, protocol, and client versions, and network latencies and shows how today's network is different from early days. In addition, based on the observations made from the measurement study, we propose a simple distance-based peer selection rule for improved connectivity and faster data propagation. The evaluation results show that our proposed lightweight and backward-compatible peer selection rule has the potential to reduce data dissemination latency.

AB In this paper, we address the performance analysis of Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based cryptocurrency on the basis of its native structure. Several attempts on existing blockchain-based cryptocurrencies to resolve the limitation of the transaction processing rate has resulted in numerous form of solutions, such as side-chain, off-chain or data sharding. While those efforts are dedicated to overcome the limitation that the one-dimensional data structure has, a two-dimensional form of distributed ledger as known as DAG-based cryptocurrency has been emerged. Comparing with blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, DAG-based cryptocurrencies feature relatively faster issuance and confirmation of the transactions due to the individual processing method of the transactions. However, existing DAG-based cryptocurrencies also suffer from the instability of the performance, since the confirmation or validation delay can be varied by network condition such as transaction incoming rate. We derive the generic performance model of DAG-based cryptocurrency while varying the parameters. From the derived models, we propose some novel strategies to improve the performance of the DAG-based cryptocurrency system which encourages the participants of the cryptocurrency (both traders and nodes) to boost the transaction processing speed while keeping the ledger healthy. We show the effectiveness of our proposal by numerical statistics obtained by simulation, which results in maximum 46 percent of increase in our case.

AB There are various methods and approaches to electronic voting all around the world. Each is connected with different benefits and issues. One of the most important and prevalent problems is lack of auditing capabilities and system verification methods. Blockchain technology, which recently gained a lot of attention, can provide a solution to this issue. This paper presents Auditable Blockchain Voting System (ABVS), which describes e-voting processes and components of a supervised internet voting system that is audit and verification capable. ABVS achieves this through utilization of blockchain technology and voter-verified paper audit trail.

TI Blockchain-Based System for Multiparty Electronic Registered Delivery
   Services
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB European Regulation (EU) 910/2014 lays down the rules for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Qualified Electronic Registered Delivery is one of the trust services included in the regulation, and it requires nonrepudiation of origin and reception together with the integrity of the data. This kind of services usually relies heavily on the use of trusted third parties. These entities are an obstacle to extend the use of protocols. In this paper, we use the blockchain-based technologies to provide, for the first time, two multiparty registered eDelivery schemes that reduce the involvement of trusted third parties compared with traditional approaches while satisfying the requirements of the norms created by the European Union for registered eDeliveries. Since confidentiality is not considered a compulsory property in the directive, we propose two protocols. The first one is well suited for those deliveries that do not require the confidentiality of the message or delivered data or even for those in which it is required that the message can be public and accessible to everybody. The second solution for multiparty registered eDelivery allows the message to be hidden to others than the receiver. We present the smart contracts for both proposals and also a complete analysis of their properties and performance.

AB Bitcoin, the most popular blockchain system, does not scale even under very optimistic assumptions. Lightning networks, a layer on top of Bitcoin, composed of one-to-one lightning channels make it scale to up to 105 Million users. Recently, Duplex Micropayment Channel factories have been proposed based on opening multiple one-to-one payment channels at once. Duplex Micropayment Channel factories rely on time-locks to update and close their channels. This mechanism yields to situation where users funds time-locking for long periods increases with the lifetime of the factory and the number of users. This makes DMC factories not applicable in real-life scenarios.
   In this paper, we propose the first channel factory construction, the Lightning Factory that offers a constant collateral cost, independent of the lifetime of the channel and members of the factory. We compare our proposed design with Duplex Micropayment Channel factories, obtaining better performance results by a factor of more than 3000 times in terms of the worst-case constant collateral cost incurred when malicious users use the factory. The message complexity of our factory is n where Duplex Micropayment Channel factories need n(2) messages where n is the number of users. Moreover, our factory copes with an infinite number of updates while in Duplex Micropayment Channel factories the number of updates is bounded by the initial time-lock.
   Finally, we discuss the necessity for our Lightning Factories of BNN, a non-interactive aggregate signature cryptographic scheme, and compare it with Schnorr and ECDSA schemes used in Bitcoin and Duplex Micropayment Channels.

AB The energy market is entering the transitional period, and various types of energy markets such as solar energy will be formed beyond oil and gas. Correspondingly, energy prosumers that individuals and institutions produce and trade surplus electricity will become more widespread. Using the block chain, it guarantees the immutability and transparency of energy transactions, generates ERC20 tokens based on smart contracts, and transactions are automatically executed without third party intervention and can be extended to various transaction conditions. In the transaction, the energy is transferred using the Energy Storage System(ESS) which the seller and the buyer belong, and payment is made by transferring the token through a transaction. Based on this information, this paper suggests proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) system that can freely trade the produced energy.

In this paper, we discuss online test and management system using private blockchain and CPABE(Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, create an 'Access tree' based on the user attribute to encrypt the information) algorithm. In the system, the private blockchain network is constructed with the nodes of the system manager, examiners, and examinees, and each node has different authority. Since the data encrypted by the CP-ABE algorithm cannot be decrypted without the corresponding attribute, it is impossible to read or modify the data.

AB With the widespread of cloud computing, the delegation of storage and computing is becoming a popular trend. Concerns on data integrity, security, user privacy as well as the correctness of execution are highlighted due to the untrusted remote data manipulation. Most of existing proposals solve the integrity checking and verifiable computation problems by challenge-response model, but are lack of scalability and reusability. Via blockchain, we achieve efficient and transparent public verifiable delegation for both storage and computing. Meanwhile, the smart contract provides API for request handling and secure data query. The security and privacy issues of data opening are settled by applying cryptographic algorithms all through the delegations. Additionally, any access to the outsourced data requires the owner's authentication, so that the dat transference and utilization are under control.

AB Traditional tea sets are biased on the design, manufacture and sale of handicrafts. In the context of Blockchain, the comparison of tea makers' consumer wishes and data statistics, combined with the design cloud service platform, will inevitably bring about a huge change in the design industry chain. Through two experiments, this paper reveals the relationship between consumer and product closeness, psychological distance and social distance. At the same time, based on the research and analysis of tea product design impact factor, it is uploaded to the product design cloud service platform. Let users mine design requirements, set up design teams, establish an open and shared industrial design, network interaction environment, and realize the design life cycle process through collaboration between front-end and back-end of the cloud service platform, combined with corresponding access technologies and virtualization technologies. Sharing and collaboration will also provide data and technical support for the breakthrough of the block industry chain in the later period.

AB Smart Contracts, which derive from Blockchain technology, are one of the most peremptory applications of this. However, as it is a very recent technology, investors' uncertainty and fear makes their development slowly and cautiously. There are, therefore, a number of questions and legal problems that arise. The paper identifies what revolution Blockchain adds to the contractual processes, exploring its potential and analysing the main legal difficulties it is facing. It seeks the analysis of the pros and cons of this new technology, specially the questions about enforcement, nature and form, consent and (in) flexibility. The purpose of this investigation is to recognize the nature of this technology and its impact on the Contract Law. And because of this, the impact and challenges that it brings to the Governance of a nation as well as on private companies and individuals. Therefore this study is based mostly in the review of already existing embryonic laws about Blockchain technology or similar, authors that wrote about Smart Contracts and also some recent news to show the social and economic impact in the world. In short, the subject that this paper presents is the beginning of a true technological, social and economic revolution that must be anticipated and prepared by the law and those who work with it.

SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are the internal mechanism used in many cryptocurrencies to represent coins. Such representation has some clear benefits, but also entails some complexities that, if not properly handled, may leave the system in an inefficient state. Specifically, inefficiencies arise when wallets the software responsible for transferring coins between parties) do not manage UTXOs properly when performing payments. In this paper, we study three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin, by analysing the state of their UTXO sets, that is, the status of their sets of spendable coins. These three cryptocurrencies are the top-3 UTXO-based cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Our analysis shows that the usage of each cryptocurrency presents some differences, and led to different results. Furthermore, it also points out that the management of the transactions has not always been performed efficiently and therefore, the current state of the UTXO sets is far from ideal.

AB Blockchain technology along with Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing is expected to cause disruption in the existing business processes at unprecedented scale. Smart Contracts which represent business logic are consolidated by blockchain architecture. A smart contract is a self-executing program that may be triggered on events generated by IoT sensors, actuators or tags. Blockchain and smart contracts which find their optimum suitability in multiparty arrangements are anticipated to bring a paradigm shift in the domains of Supply-chain and logistics. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the disruptive innovation happening in the logistics processes due to blockchain, smart contracts and Internet of Things. We highlight the some of the most important Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the logistics domain being positively affected due to this digital disruption and the required characteristics in the blockchain technologies for this paradigm shift to take place.

AB "Blockchain", "distributed ledger" and "smart contract" are terms that were anonymous only a decade ago, but today they are increasingly aggressive present in our daily lives. The financial industry is one of the areas in which the implementation of blockchain technology is reasonably expected to lead to dramatic changes. The time of the initial euphoria is gone, giving way to realism and "sobering" of the illusions about the possibilities and limitations to the feasibility of the new technology. The main research goal of the present study is systematization and testing using selected criteria, to arrive at a differentiated assessment of the degree of applicability of blockchain in different segments of the financial services industry. The methodological tools used are based on literature review and secondary data, through which the expected positioning of blockchain in the financial industry in line with the Gartner Hype Cycle of Emerging Technologies is explored. Based on the analysis of the specificities of the selected segments of the financial industry and the comparative analysis of the benefits and limitations in the development and application of the technology, the criteria for assessing the degree of applicability and the expected impact of blockchain technology on the analyzed segments are systematized. The results of the study testify to the uneven level of impact and penetration of blockchain in various spheres of the financial industry. The main challenges and barriers to the application of the technology and the possible solutions for overcoming them are outlined.

AB Smart contracts are transactional scripts on the top of the blockchain technology that are created for executing and enforcing legal contracts. Self-executable they check contractual pre-defined conditions and automatically fulfil respective actions or transactions, respectively. Through this form of automation, the layers of middlemen can be reduced or even completely replaced. Accordingly, smart contracts bear the potential to decrease transaction and enforcement costs. In addition to this narrow obvious characteristic, we argue that smart contracts encase the potential to foster entrepreneurial collaborations of cross-organisational business processes and enabling trans-national networks of entrepreneurs and SMEs to enter into new business sectors which are currently still closed due to high entry barriers or to domination of big players. Especially, the logistics sector is well-known for dominating global players that try to limit entrepreneurial activities of small companies by using closed organisational structures and dedicated IT systems. The foundation and the organisational support for entrepreneurial collaborations in such logistics-related networks can be realised by the implementation of decentralized autonomous organisations based on blockchain technology and smart contracting. Accordingly, this paper discusses the research question how smart contracting and blockchain technology can facilitate the implementation of collaborative business structures for sustainable trans-national entrepreneurial activities in logistics networks. Our research is based on expert interviews, surveys and case studies from several EU projects with a focus on the ongoing project "Connect2SmallPorts". The research results will showcase and assess this potential of using smart contracting in the case of charter-parties.

AB As of today, most of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices work in a centralized environment. With IoT devices having to execute thousands of operations per second, it has become difficult for centralized systems to handle such platforms. Also, factors like operational and maintenance cost of these server machines and danger of DoS(Denial of Service) attack on such servers has threatened the practitioners to come up with a more distributed way of storing the contents. With its decentralized and privacy preserving features, blockchain technology fits well into the scheme of things. This mitigates the quintessential challenges faced in most of the centralized systems. In this paper, we are focusing on the new firmware update scheme to perform the update operations securely. We propose a blockchain based solution for managing firmware updates in IoT. Improper management of devices and distribution of firmware updates from the device vendor could sabotage the IoT ecosystem. The objective of this proposed scheme is to verify and distribute the firmware binaries securely to the IoT device deployed by the device vendor. The PUSH-based method is used for a firmware update in which verification of firmware is done by Hash Chain. It preserves the integrity of firmware by linking the latest version information by previous versions information with the help of a smart contract mechanism.

AB This paper presents a proposal for developing secure social media spaces for groups of people that could be vulnerable to external influences. These could be refuges from war torn or politically unstable countries that could be persecuted by political opponents, or young children that could be targeted online by paedophiles and other online criminals. The system utilizes Block-Chaining technologies to provide the secure environment and Recommender Systems to link members to sub-groups based on their preferable discussion topics and ideas. There are challenges in the proposal as the key issue of trust in the system must be guaranteed by a third party. This organization will need to verify the identity of every subscriber and then create secure user identities / profiles that guarantee the anonymity of members. Block-chaining technologies will also allow the monitoring of user behaviour to ensure the trustworthiness of the environment is maintained. The cost of the system and its operation will be another consideration. The reputation of Block-Chaining technologies due to its links with crypto-currencies should not be considered a negative factor as there are many successful implementations in everyday life

AB Security and Privacy are some of the important aspects to be considered in the large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Due to the large number of IoT devices and the different administrative domains in which they operate, traditional approaches involving a Centralized server for managing Authorizations will not be scalable or efficient. In this paper, we propose a Decentralized Capability-Based Access Control framework using IOTA (DCACI); IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger that enables fee-less micro transactions for the IoT. The DCACI framework enables complete privacy and integrity of the Capability tokens using IOTA's Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM) technology. It enables device owners and users to Grant, Update, Delegate and Revoke the capability tokens. The proposed DCACI framework has been implemented as a proof-of-concept on a resource constrained machine; the results indicate that it is capable of scaling up to large-scale infrastructure such as a Smart City, having millions of IoT devices.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this work, we perform a comprehensive empirical study of smart contracts deployed on the ethereum blockchain. The objective of the analysis is to provide empirical results on smart contracts features, smart contract transactions within the blockchain, the role of the development community, and the source code characteristics. We collected a set of more than 10 000 smart contracts source codes and a dataset of meta-data regarding their interaction with the blockchain from etherscan.io . We examined the collected data computing different statistics on naming policies, smart contract ether balance, number of smart contract transactions, functions, and other quantities characterizing the use and purpose of smart contracts. We found that the number of transactions and the balances follow power-law distributions and the software code metrics display, on average, values lower than corresponding metrics in standard software but have high variances. Focusing the attention on the 20 smart contracts with the topmost number of transactions, we found that most of them represent financial smart contracts and some of them have peculiar software development stories behind them. The results show that blockchain software is rapidly changing and evolving and it is no longer devoted only to cryptovalues applications but to general purpose computation.

AB While direct allocation of spectrum and evolved medium access protocols provide a base for ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the existing TCP/IP and OSI models were designed for wired networks and do not address open interconnection of air interfaces. Without an interworking model for the air interface, existing network designs continue to tie wireless medium access to that of the backhaul provider for ownership of access and identity trust, resulting in limitations on functionality and coverage.
   In this paper, we propose a novel solution to access ownership and identity trust by extending the TCP network standard, under a new model we propose, named TCP-Air which integrates distributed ledger technologies directly at the air interface. Further, we present two use cases of the TCP-Air model, demonstrating applications not feasible under existing permissioned-access network designs.

In addition to traditional graph analysis methods, new metrics need to be engineered specifically for the bitcoin transaction graph. Hence, we propose a new centrality measure named mint centrality. The measure uses the inherent tree structure of transactions in bitcoin and their relation to the corresponding set of coinbase transactions, and can be evaluated with linear complexity. We present preliminary results of the mint centrality on the first 200,000 blocks of the public bitcoin blockchain.

TI ENSURING OF THE SHIPPING ECOSYSTEM EFFICIENCY IN THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
   PARADIGM: E-NAVIGATION CONCEPT
SO MARINE INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGIES
AB Topic. Maritime shipping is an important component of the transport system, ensuring the development of trade relations both within a particular country and abroad. At the same time, this is an infrastructure sector, which makes it dependent on current trends in the economic development of the world. In this regard, one of the primary tasks of the transport industry should be a movement towards ensuring the growth of the national economy and its integration into the world economic system, which is impossible without the adoption and implementation of the digitalization concept of the global economy.
   Purpose of the study is to identify potential opportunities for improving shipping efficiency based on the paradigm of the digital economy.
   Methods of research. The methodology is based on the analysis of approaches to the formation of sustainable competitive advantages of shipping; comparative, statistical and dynamic analysis of indicators characterizing the possibility of increasing the efficiency of navigation through the use of the digital economy paradigm.
   Results. It is substantiated that at the moment the prerequisites have already been formed and the conditions have been created for the active implementation of digital technologies in the practice of maritime navigation. Several key concepts are highlighted, such as single window, e-Navigation, blockchain.
   Conclusion. The impact of the implementation of the e-Navigation concept on improving of Russian ports and shipping companies activity is analyzed in the article. The novelty lies in the consideration of the "ship-seaport" logistics link as a business ecosystem and the use of "end-to-end technologies" of digitalization, which allow switching to the "single window" mode from the point of view of information support. The practical implementation of the proposed approach will allow identifying additional sources of competitive advantages of the national segment of the shipping business.

TI Business institutions of economic activity digitalization
SO UPRAVLENETS-THE MANAGER
AB The paper discusses the special features of transformation of business institutions in the process of economic activity digitalization. Methodologically the research is premised on the theoretical concepts of evolutionary and neo-institutional theory, the concepts of the sharing and digital economy. The basic research method is a logical-structural analysis of theoretical and empirical data in the public domain. The study reveals socio-technological driving forces of the development of the digital economy: big data, cloud and blockchain technologies, digital platforms, the Internet of things, the concept of a smart city and the sharing economy. The author formulates the characteristics of economic activity digitalization: an increase in the share of services in total production, a growing decentralization of resources, a rise in the share of instant transactions, the use of cloud technologies, the development of the sharing economy and institutional support for business. The article lays down the principles of economic activity digitalization based on decentralization of resources that embrace expediency, usefulness and effectiveness of digitalization. The paper also identifies the principles of evolutionary development: uncertainty, formality and inevitability of digitalization. It looks at the transformation of business institutions in the process of economic activity digitalization, which lies in three processes: a significant reduction in life cycles of business institutions resulting from making rapid managerial decisions, as well as the increasing role and the shifting content of informal business institutions to the field of rational values and self-expression. The author demonstrates the application of socio-technological driving forces to manage a firm's resources. The use of blockchain technologies and big data is expedient to manage labour resources. Cloud technologies and crowdfunding are used to regulate financial resources. When managing the development of material resources, it is advisable to apply the Internet of things and the sharing economy. Information resources are organized through digital platforms. The research findings can be of use when mapping out strategies for the development of individual companies, sectoral markets and state management of economic sectors.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) promises technical solutions to many important societal problems relating to the environment, healthcare, transportation, etc. One approach to making IoT solutions more cost-effective is the idea of horizontal integration, where sensors and actuators are shared between different applications. In such environments, economic transactions between system components are used to pay for data and services. Blockchain-based overlay networks have been developed to provide such financial mechanism for IoT devices with sufficient processing power and operating system support. However, no practical solutions for low-end devices exist. In addition, existing solutions also require setting up multiple blockchain accounts for a single administrative domain, which incurs high fees when consolidating those accounts. In this paper, we propose a Ticket-Based Verification Protocol, which defines two separate logical entities, contract manager and transaction verifier. Our design limits the need for high-performance embedded systems to only one unit per administrative domain and reduces the processing and networking overhead other IoT devices in that domain.

TI Digital Forensics Architecture for Evidence Collection and Provenance
   Preservation in IaaS Cloud Environment Using SDN and Blockchain
   Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Cloud forensics is an intelligent evolution of digital forensics that defends against cyber-crimes. However, centralized evidence collection and preservation minimizes the reliability of digital evidence. To resolve this severe problem, this paper proposes a novel digital forensic architecture using fast-growing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Blockchain technology for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud. In this proposed forensic architecture, the evidence is collected and preserved in the blockchain that is distributed among multiple peers. To protect the system from unauthorized users, Secure Ring Verification based Authentication (SRVA) scheme is proposed. To strengthen the cloud environment, secret keys are generated optimally by using Harmony Search Optimization (HSO) algorithm. All data are encrypted based on the sensitivity level and stored in the cloud server. For encryption, Sensitivity Aware Deep Elliptic Curve Cryptography (SA-DECC) algorithm is presented. For every data stored in the cloud, a block is created in the SDN controller and the history of data is recorded as metadata. In each block, the Merkle hash tree is built by using Secure Hashing Algorithm-3 (SHA-3). Our system allows users to trace their data by deploying Fuzzy based Smart Contracts (FCS). Finally, evidence analysis is enabled by constructing Logical Graph of Evidence (LGoE) collected from the blockchain. Experiments are conducted in an integrated environment of java (for cloud and blockchain) and network simulator-3.26 (for SDN). The extensive analysis shows that proposed forensic architecture shows promising results in Response time, Evidence insertion time, Evidence verification time, Communication overhead, Hash computation time, Key generation time, Encryption time, Decryption time and total change rate.

TI Shifting digital currency definitions: current considerations in
   Australian and US tax law
SO EJOURNAL OF TAX RESEARCH
AB Digital currency as an intangible asset is designed, in part, to circumvent the reach of regulatory bodies. As such, the emergence of this asset into global markets requires tax regulators to be particularly nimble with respect to regulation.
   This article reviews the rapidly shifting regulatory landscape of digital currency by comparing its definition, for tax purposes, as an intangible asset under Australian and US tax law. The article finds that reactive regulatory responses triggered a piecemeal inclusion of digital currencies into a pre-existing taxation framework, causing unintended regulatory consequences. The article concludes that the regulation of digital currency needs to be increasingly proactive, as the placement of new market products under an existing definitional framework leads to inconsistencies in regulatory application. While tax administration will not drive stabilisation of the digital marketplace, tax administrators might consider that regulation of digital currency, as a new hybrid intangible asset in a global marketplace, may provide an opportunity to consider forward-thinking global harmonisation.

AB The consensus algorithm played a significant role in successful adoption of Blockchain technology. The security of bitcoin blockchain hugely depends on the complexity and reliability of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus. However, a non-financial application, whose security requirements are less demanding, requires faster operation and so PoW is not suitable for many of the commercial applications. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Trust-dependent Consensus scheme (TCON) for a blockchain based IoT access control framework. TCON ensures that the blocks are added at a faster rate, spending minimal energy compared to PoW based systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the notion of trust is quantified and used as a means to simplify the consensus problem in blockchain. A comparison of the various metrics to understand the differences in overhead involved suggest that the proposed scheme outperforms other non-trust-based consensus schemes.

AB We present an approach for analyzing Ethereum smart contracts regarding to the issue of 'gasless send' [1, p. 8]. Gasless send is about contracts which lose the ability to receive Ether due to gas depletion when executing the contract's fallback function. Our approach is based on the security analysis tool Mythril which is a framework for analyzing security issues in Ethereum smart contracts. Mythril's analysis engine is based on symbolic code execution and features different analyses for security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We upgraded the analysis engine in order to model the gas usage of Ethereum smart contracts during execution. In order to utilize the newly acquired data, we added an analysis module to detect fallback functions, whose execution may exceed the defined threshold of gas. Our analysis of 167,698 smart contracts currently deployed to the live Ethereum network shows that a total of 96.3 thousand (or 57%) might be affected by the issue of gasless send.

TI Blockchain in healthcare
SO AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Blockchain is treated as a ledger system that manages data and their transactions using time-stamped blocks through cryptography and works in a decentralised manner over the computing network. Although blockchain is originally used as a backbone for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, its capabilities and applications have yet to be extended far beyond cryptocurrencies. In this paper, through conducting a latest systematic literature review aiming to produce new source of evidence, we identify potential applications of the blockchain technologies in healthcare. The comprehensive review looks at the professional and academic open-sourced journals published between 2008 to 2019 to recognise the potential of blockchain based approaches in the purpose of healthcare information disseminations, as well as to segregate issues for the implementation and development of blockchain applications. We identify several major application domains that present research opportunities and challenges for the future advancements and directions for the benefits of IS researchers and professionals.

AB Technologies such as blockchains, smart contracts and programmable batteries facilitate emerging models of energy distribution, trade and consumption, and generate a considerable number of opportunities for energy markets. However, these developments complicate relationships between stakeholders, disrupting traditional notions of value, control and ownership. Discussing these issues with the public is particularly challenging as energy consumption habits often obscure the competing values and interests that shape stakeholders' relationships. To make such difficult discussions more approachable and examine the missing relational aspect of autonomous energy systems, we combined the design of speculative hairdryers with performance and deliberation. This integrated method of inquiry makes visible the competing values and interests, eliciting people's wishes to negotiate these terms. We argue that the complexity of mediated energy distribution and its convoluted stakeholder relationships requires more sophisticated methods of inquiry to engage people in debates concerning distributed energy systems.

AB Supply chain networks are global, multi-modal platforms that are expected to facilitate seamless exchange of physical goods, information across multiple industries and enterprises and stakeholders. Current supply chain information systems are limited in term of providing validated, real-time asset specific business relevant information during its lifecycle. Only one or few stakeholders have information access privilege causing both information asymmetry and inefficiencies in the $35T global supply chain market. Emerging technologies such as IoT and Blockchain democratize "trustworthy" data availability and empower stakeholders to make the right decision at the right time in the most cost-effective manner. Digital supply chain integration is progressively becoming a competitive differentiation of enterprises. Organizations leading to this approach of digital supply chain are rapidly improving their asset utilization and enabling new data-based services. This paper presents the idea about relevance of complementary technologies like IoT and Blockchain technology for complete digitization of supply chain. The business case of pallet renting vendor is taken to showcase the use of technology integration to improve efficiency of its supply chain and asset management.

TI INTER-MARKETS VOLATILITY SPILLOVER IN US BITCOIN AND FINANCIAL MARKETS
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT
AB This paper investigates the volatility spillover dynamics between U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets from July 19, 2010 to December 29, 2017. Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) volatility spillover index, Barunik, Kocenda, and Vacha (2017) Spillover Asymmetry Measure, and Barunik and Krehlik (2018) frequency connectedness methodologies are applied to investigate the time varying dynamics of volatility spillover among U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets. The findings of the study indicate the presence of low level of integration and contagion between U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets. Asymmetric nature of volatility spillover is also detected. The connectedness among the U.S. Bitcoin and financial markets is found to be concentrated at high frequency, suggesting that markets process information rapidly. Moreover, the turbulence in Bitcoin market will have insignificant effect on U.S. financial markets. This non-contagion nature of Bitcoin markets provides significant risk hedging and diversification benefits for domestic and foreign investors in the U.S.

AB This paper proposes a new device-to-device edge computing and networks (D2D-ECN) framework which facilitates low-latency execution of real-time Internet-of Things applications through computation offloading with minimal overhead. Our framework accounts for key challenges of D2D-ECN in terms of the efficiency of the resource management and the resulting security concerns caused by lacking trustworthy between task owners and resource providers. In particular, we propose to use a blockchain-empowered framework for implementing resource trading and task assigment as the smart contracts. However, the existing Proof-of-Work (PoW) is impractical for the resource-constrained toT devices due to high computational complexity of the mining process. Thus, we present a reputation-based consensus mechanism called proof-of-reputation (PoR), where the device with the highest reputation score is responsible for packaging the resource transactions and reputation records in the blockchain. Furthermore, we evaluate the reputation score of each device according to the current computation performance and history reputation. Security, feasibility analysis and numerical results show that our proposed computation offloading scheme can be deployed in the decentralized D2D-ECN system safely and effectively.

AB With the continuous development and wide application of blockchain technology, the problem of privacy leakage is becoming more and more prominent and must be fully taken seriously. This paper proposes a new blockchain signature scheme based on the aggregation signature scheme for the privacy protection of transaction addresses in blockchain. Compared with related schemes, the privacy protection scheme reduces the computational overhead of the signature and verification process, reduces the storage overhead of the blockchain, and improves the communication efficiency. The theoretical analysis results show that the scheme is safe and effective, and can protect the identity privacy of the receiver in the blockchain transaction.

AB Attribute-based encryption describes the access policy with the attribute information of users. In practice, attributes usually have a certain lifespan. The existing time-based access control methods directly relate attribute keys to time. Thus, under the constraint of fine-grained time, when the attribute expires, the update of key and policy adds a large additional burden to the data user and owner. In this paper, we propose a dynamic attribute-based access control scheme to set a fine-grained valid time period for each attribute, which not only facilitates dynamic data sharing, but also enables flexible attribute revocation. We use smart contract to set valid time period for attributes. It provides smart management on users' attributes and avoids the waiting time of CSP caused by manual operations. We also introduce trapdoor that are indirectly related to time and proxy decryption method to reduce computational cost on data owners and users. Extensive security and performance analysis shows the security strength and effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Blockchain technology is transforming traditional financial systems. Cross-border money remittance industry is in a crossroad being challenged. The traditional SWIFT system is facing new comers like Ripple system which is based on the blockchain distributed ledger technology with its own crypto tokens. This paper conducts a SWOT analysis on both technologies to find out whether the blockchain technology has the potential to transform a traditional industry and how this may be possible. We conclude that Ripple has all of the advantages over SWIFT despite some minor issues. In short-term, SWIFT will still take the lead in the remittance market due to the economy of scale. However, in long-term, emerging technology like Ripple will eventually revolutionize the remittance industry or even other financial systems. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Blockchain is a database technology that provides the integrity and trust of the system can't make arbitrary modifications and deletions by being an append-only distributed ledger. That is, the blockchain is not a modification or deletion but a CRAB (Create-Retrieve-Append-Burn) method in which data can be read and written according to a legitimate user's access right(For example, owner private key). However, this can not delete the created data once, which causes problems such as privacy breach. In this paper, we propose an on-off block chained Hybrid Blockchain system to separate the data and save the connection history to the blockchain. In addition, the state is changed to the distributed database separately from the ledger record, and the state is changed by generating the arbitrary injection in the XOR form, so that the history of modification / deletion of the Off Blockchain can be efficiently retrieved.

AB Applications in the area of IoT and smart cities rely heavily on data to manage and control their operational environments. In such applications, machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms help the government officials, city administrators, and industries to make an informed decision on managing their cities and factories using the data collected from various sources. As we step into the era where "data is termed as new oil", there is a need for protocols with support for selling and buying data without giving up the data ownership to third-parties. In this demo, we present Streaming Data Payment Protocol (SDPP), which is an application layer protocol for selling and buying data. SDPP uses blockchain and distributed ledger technology for micropayments and immutable storage of transaction records. In addition, our protocol has a built-in mechanism to set data granularity since the bulk transfer of data between a seller and a buyer may lead to a loss for the seller if the buyer terminates the connection after receiving the data without making a payment. In this demo, we present SDPP and explain how it can contribute to the emerging data economy using a proof-of-concept implementation that uses TCP protocol for data communication and IOTA as both cryptocurrency and a distributed ledger.

AB The proliferation of renewable energy systems and high-capacity batteries has enabled customers to trade their excess energy on the market in a peer-to-peer manner through the smart grid. At the same time, electric vehicles (EVs) are enjoying widespread acceptance, leading to a higher demand for charging stations. In this paper, we propose a system where energy traders and EV owners collectively work to satisfy the energy demands of EVs. Specifically, energy traders make bids to EV owners who, in turn, reserve their preferred charging station for a specific period of time. To protect the privacy of EV owners, we also introduce an anonymous payment system that cannot link individual owners to specific charging locations. Finally, to guarantee the security and transparency of the entire system, we store all transactions on a consortium blockchain that is managed by the energy traders and the financial institutions that support the anonymous payment system. Our experimental results indicate that the overhead of the cryptographic operations involved in the major transactions is low, in terms of both computational and communication cost.

AB Custom tokens are an integral component of decentralized applications (dapps) deployed on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. For Ethereum, the ERC20 standard is a widely used token interface and is interoperable with many existing dapps, user interface platforms, and popular web applications (e.g., exchange services). An ERC20 security issue, known as the multiple withdrawal attack, was raised on GitHub and has been open since October 2017. The issue concerns ERC20's defined method approve() which was envisioned as a way for token holders to give permission for other users and dapps to withdraw a capped number of tokens. The security issue arises when a token holder wants to adjust the amount of approved tokens from N to M (this could be an increase or decrease). If malicious, a user or dapp who is approved for N tokens can front-run the adjustment transaction to first withdraw N tokens, then allow the approval to be confirmed, and withdraw an additional M tokens. In this paper, we evaluate 10 proposed mitigations for this issues and find that no solution is fully satisfactory. We then propose 2 new solutions that mitigate the attack, one of which fully fulfills constraints of the standard, and the second one shows a general limitation in addressing this issue from ERC20's approve method.

AB Blockchain technology holds great promise to rewire the current financial system which relies on the third party. Every transaction is recorded in a secure and transparent for the parties in the blockchain network. Blockchain technology in the energy sector becomes an interesting topic among researchers at this moment. The use of blockchain allows producers and consumers to trade energy transactions through smart grids because of a decentralized energy trading system. The trading activities without a third party involved would reduce the cost of a transaction thus it brings to a new level of quality of service in the trading system. In this paper, we propose an architectural model for decentralized energy trading system among the neighbors that allows the producer who has the surplus energy to conduct a trading activity with his/her neighbors. The transactions manage by the miners in the same blockchain network. Moreover, we analyze the security issues from various attacks and presenting the performance of the selected attack that might occur in the model.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The shared storage is essential in the decentralized system. A straightforward storage model with guaranteed privacy protection on the peer-to-peer network is a challenge in the blockchain technology. The decentralized storage system should provide the privacy for the parties since it contains numerous data that are sensitive and dangerous if misused by maliciously. In this paper, we present a model for shared storage on a blockchain network which allows the authorized parties to access the data on storage without having to reveal their identity. Ring signatures combined with several protocols are implemented to disguise the signer identity thereby the observer is unlikely to determine the identity of the parties. We apply our proposed scheme in the healthcare domain, namely, decentralized personal health information (PHI). In addition, we present a dilemma to improve performance in a decentralized system.

AB Once a subject is diagnosed with cancer, a patient goes through a series of diagnosis and tests, referred to as after cancer treatment. Due to the nature of the treatment and side effects on regular lifestyles, maintaining quality of life in the home environment is a challenging task. Sometimes within a home environment, a cancer patient's situation changes abruptly, as the functionality of certain organs deteriorate, which affects their quality of life. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain and off-chain based framework which will allow multiple medical and ambient intelligent IoT sensors to capture quality of life information from one's home environment and securely share it with one's community of interest. Using our proposed framework, both transactional records and multimedia big data - consisting of a user's physiological as well as mental states - can be shared with an oncologist or palliative care unit for real-time decision support. We have also developed Blockchain-based data analytics, which will allow a clinician to visualize the immutable history of the patient's data available from an in-home secure monitoring system for a better understanding of a patient's current or historical states. We further designed a generic oncologist smart contract and digital wallet for different stakeholders to automate the treatment plan of a particular patient. Finally, we will present our current implementation status, which provides significant encouragement for further development.

AB Blockchain's properties in addressing trust in highly decentralized environments can make it an enabler for novel sharing economy services. In this paper, we demonstrate the practicality of blockchain-based Secure IoT as a Service ( SIoTaaS), where an IoT device can be rented from a service provider, securely and in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our framework allows the simultaneous operations of distinct providers of IoT-based sharing economy services at a large scale. Multiple parties can securely share text and multimedia in the context of location and point-of-interest sharing, perform financial transactions by hiding true identity of parties involved in various online transactions, perform user and IoT registration, transfer value transactions via Ethereum tokens between providers and consumers, as well as raw IoT data payload. This can turn smart room IoT devices, such as smart locks, light bulbs, air conditioning and fans into rentable business entities within a secure sharing economy platform. We will demonstrate such a proof of concept IoT sharing economy framework, which is specifically designed to support the temporary IoT needs of very large numbers of users, such as Hajj pilgrims concentrating for a short period of time at a single area in Saudi Arabia.

TI A Blockchain-Based Non-Invasive Cyber-Physical Occupational Therapy
   Framework: BCI Perspective
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Although ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG) signals allow subjects suffering from neuromuscular disorders to interface their brains with the cyber-physical world, occupational therapy can be enhanced with the introduction of further modalities better assist the disabled person. In this paper, we propose an in-home occupational therapy environment, which leverages a rich set of occupational therapy-related activity recognition modalities, namely, EEG signals to understand brain activity, ElectroMyoGram (EMG) signals for muscle activity, gesture-tracking sensors for forward and inverse kinematics activities, and smart home appliance control sensors. To support a wide variety of disabled people's in-home occupational therapy, we have incorporated both selective attention and motor imagery processes for mapping a mental command with that of an occupational therapy-related command within a serious game environment. To attain higher accuracy and to avoid a higher number of false positives, a subject is first recommended to use a selective attention-based serious game in which a digital avatar of the subject acting as a model therapist will guide the therapy session. Once familiar with the generation of proper motor imagery, an advanced user can use self-paced motor imagery signals to perform occupational therapy activities within the serious game environment. The occupational therapy consists of a serious game environment in which smart home appliances are mapped with therapeutic activities through forward and inverse kinematics. The therapy data has been secured through blockchain and off-chain-based distributed repositories. The test results show the viability of using the framework in a clinical environment.

AB Autonomous Driving car is an upcoming technology. In our project, we are taking a step towards this vision by developing a system using Raspberry Pi, image processing and machine learning and connect the system to any electric car. The proposed system provides an autonomous car feature to any existing electric car on the road that doesn't have autonomous driving feature inbuilt within it. Most existing electric cars that are on roads don't have this technology and this is mostly found in new and expensive cars. An alarming fact about autonomous cars is that many of them are being frequently hacked, indicating a problem related to security. The application of blockchain network, which seems to provide security and transparency in the usage of the network is employed to transfer data. Using the proposed system, such autonomous car feature can be installed separately at a cheaper expense in all existing electric cars. We aim to achieve the above by using image processing which is trained by using neural networks to create a model through which autonomous cars are achieved. With the usage of blockchain network, security and transparency of data transfer can be achieved. The hardware components used in this project are Raspberry PI 3 B microcomputer and camera module. This Raspberry Pi and camera unit forms a separate system which, when connected to the electronic control unit, helps the car to drive automatically.

AB In high-stakes multi-party policy making based on machine learning and simulation models involving independent computing agents, a notion of trust in results is critical in facilitating transparency, accountability, and collaboration. Using a novel combination of distributed validation of atomic computation blocks and a blockchain-based immutable audit mechanism, this work proposes a framework for distributed trust in computations. In particular we address the scalability problem by reducing the storage and communication costs using a lossy compression scheme. This framework guarantees not only verifiability of final results, but also the validity of local computations, and its cost-benefit tradeoffs are studied using a synthetic example of training a neural network.

AB In this work we investigate which aspects of data protection regulation must be carefully observed when implementing Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. This technology provides interesting properties and allows governments to develop flexible and innovative data management systems. Nevertheless, realizing the benefits of using Blockchains requires understanding the government processes along with the legal framework and political setting imposed on government. Though it is a buzzword, Blockchain may not always be the best solution for data processing, and carrying out a Data Protection Impact Assessment could allow an analysis of the necessity and proportionality of the mechanism. Furthermore, principles relating to security of data remain applicable to Blockchains. We discuss points of interaction between Blockchain technology and the European Union data protection framework, and provide recommendations on how to better develop Blockchain-based projects in smart cities. The findings of the study should provide public sector actors with a guideline to assess the real necessity and better format of a Blockchain-based application.

In this paper, we investigate whether an M2M economy would be feasible within the IOTA network, a popular cryptocurrency for IoT. We build and present a simple industrial lot-size one production system involving three agents that cooperate to create an artistic painting. Payments between agents and users are autonomously executed via IOTA. Amongst other points of criticism, we found that an M2M economy would benefit from the support of smart-contracts and conclude that IOTA is not a fitting solution. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB A Smart Contract is self-executable and self-enforceable program code that runs on the top of blockchain to manage complex business logic. It eliminates the need of extrinsic enforcement of legal agreements. Furthermore, it enforces the terms and conditions of an agreement that lies between untrustworthy parties in which the trusted third parties cannot interfere. The cryptography logic used in smart contract enables the blockchain network to provide trust and authority to all parties in transaction. Network decentralization, data immutability and transparency, resiliency and security make blockchain technology more versatile. Recently, it has become a potential quality and capability of IoT to connect uncountable electronic objects or devices at the same time. The most prominent feature of blockchain-based IoT applications is the integration of smart contracts between blockchain and IoT.
   A brief comparison has been given in the paper that how the smart contracts react on multiple blockchain platforms with respect to scalability, system complexity and consensus protocol factors. Furthermore, the context of Smart contract integration between blockchain and IoT with highlighting the integration opportunities and challenges along with future research directions. Therefore, we have concluded in the current paper that amalgamation of Blockchain with IoT through Smart Contract can provide a strong framework for distributed application and the newly introduced business communities.

TI A Roadmap Toward the Resilient Internet of Things for Cyber-Physical
   Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous system connecting many different devices-the things-which can be accessed from the distance. The cyber-physical systems (CPSs) monitor and control the things from the distance. As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined. The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This paper summarizes the state of the art of existing work on anomaly detection, fault-tolerance, and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the main challenges in building a resilient IoT for the CPS, which is crucial in the era of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions, work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable "Trustworthy IoT for CPS". Finally, this framework is illustrated on a selected use case: a smart sensor infrastructure in the transport domain.

AB Connected vehicles are designed to make informed safety-related decisions based on the data/information they receive from various on-board sensors and other vehicles in their vicinity. However, attacks directed towards on-board sensors and network attacks on the wireless communication channels can adversely impact the correctness and integrity of this information and present a grave security and safety challenge to connected vehicles. Current centralized security solutions are not a good fit as they do not scale well and are unable to validate the correctness of the shared data. Decentralizing security provisioning in connected vehicles by means of the blockchain technology is an interesting alternative for overcoming these limitations. However, current permission-less linear hash-chain based blockchain solutions have low transaction throughput, high computational cost and are resource intensive, thereby making their adoption for designing a security solution for resource constrained connected cars difficult. In this paper, we present TangleCV, a decentralized technique for secure message sharing for connected vehicles using an approach like Tangle, a directed acyclic graph based blockchain architecture. We introduce an initial design of TangleCV and describe how it provides improved efficiency and scalability against information correctness and information integrity attacks in connected vehicle networks.

AB Cryptocurrencies are an encrypted, digital peer-to-peer network used for facilitating digital barter, developed ten years ago. Cryptocurrencies provide anonymity while making transactions and have a decentralized structure when compared to other currencies. The first cryptocurrency can be traced back to the period of financial crisis (2007-08). The financial crisis pointed out the instability and the flaws of the prevalent currencies. This resulted in the introduction of a digital, decentralized currency- Bitcoin, which did not require the involvement of any third party. Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, numerous cryptocurrencies have emerged in the market. Cryptocurrency named Namecoin was introduced after Bitcoin back in the year 2011, which was later followed by Litecoin and other respective cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin obtained significant attention after its consistent rise in prices and market capitalization. In 2017, Bitcoin's price was nearly $19,000 and held a market capitalization of $314 billion USD making it the oldest, popular and highest valued cryptocurrency of all time. Currently, the market capitalization of Bitcoin has declined to $63.6 Billion and its price stands at $3,638 USD. Cryptocurrencies have observed a varied acceptance around the world. Countries like Japan, USA, Germany, Australia and many more are accepting cryptocurrencies, but these countries take some preventive measures to avoid its use for illegal transactions. Whereas, Countries like China, Vietnam, Russia, Bolivia, Columbia and Ecuador have banned the use of cryptocurrencies in their countries. Certain countries like India. Jordan, Thailand and many more remain uncertain and are yet to decide regarding its legality in their countries. Till date, a major concern remains the sustainability and stability of cryptocurrencies in the future. This paper focuses on the history of cryptocurrencies and their performance over a period 2008-17. This paper throws light on the exchange platforms and their market capitalization.

AB Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, NEO and Ripple have their own advantages and disadvantage. Bitcoin causes massive depletion of energy and computational power. NEO rewards rich miners with more blocks to validate. Ripple can only process a mere 1500 transactions per second [1] with a block time of 3.5 seconds[2]. All these major blockchains have major flaws. My Consensus Protocol "Circle of Trust" overcomes the drawbacks of other consensus protocols such as PoW, PoS and DPos. Apart from this, Circle of Trust also has an architecture capable of scaling the transactions per second, as the network of miners grow, which no other blockchain on the market is capable of doing. This consensus protocol will be able to beat VISAs 56,000 transactions per second[3] while maintaining the sequence of blocks. All this can be done because, the concept of trust score is at the heart of this consensus protocol.

AB Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Service Function Chaining (SFC) offer flexible end-to-end services that deploy virtual network functions in clouds of competing providers. Orchestration of virtual network functions occurs in a distributed and trustless environment that must tolerate byzantine failures and collusion attacks. This paper proposes BSec-NFVO, a blockchain-based system that secures orchestration operations in virtualized networks, ensuring auditability, non-repudiation and integrity. We propose an NFV-tailored blockchain and a transaction model. BSec-NFVO provides a modular architecture to secure orchestration in a simple and agile way. We develop a prototype of BSec-NFVO for the Open Platform for Network Function Virtualization (OPNFV) with an adaptation of the normal-case of a collusion-resistant consensus protocol. The results show BSec-NFVO incurs low overhead to the cloud orchestrator and presents stable performance as the number of consensus participants increases.

AB Smart city blueprint is constructed by increasing deployment of various Internet of Things devices. In this paper, we focus on data transmission and request for lane property right under the domain of an intelligent traffic system. IoT devices are usually deployed in a heterogeneous environment, with the natural gene of decentralization. Compared with cloud-based centralized architecture, in this paper, we introduce blockchain as a decentralized technology to let vehicles jointly collaborate without having to go through a central computing node authority. Data transmission between vehicles uses a peer-to-peer network in which every node communicates directly with every other node, verified by their relevant end-point nodes; lane's acquisition right is approved by all relevant vehicle nodes, as well as with consensus agreed upon via smart contract.

AB Many applications by design depend on costly trusted third-party auditors. One such example is the industrial application case of federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO), in which different organizations contribute to a complex engineering design effort. Although blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) has strong potential in reducing the dependence on such intermediaries, the architectural complexity involved in designing a solution is daunting.
   In this paper, we analyze the architectural variants for decentralized private data sharing while guaranteeing auditability and non-repudiation of data access operations, as well availability of the shared data. The architectural variants analyzed focus on attaining: (i) confidential data exchange, (ii) governing access to the shared data, (iii) providing data access auditability, and (iv) data validation or conflict resolution. We systematically enumerate architectural decisions at the levels of: storage, policy-based file access control, data encryption methods, and auditability mechanisms for private data.
   The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive overview of architectural variants for decentralized control of private encrypted data, and the involved trade-offs in terms of performance, storage overhead, auditable trust and security. These findings are validated in the context of the aforementioned industry case that involves federated multi-disciplinary optimization (MDO).

AB Lithopia is a prototype of a blockchain-managed fictional village that uses satellite and drone data to trigger smart contracts on the open source blockchain platform, Hyperledger. The project is testing the possibility of anticipatory governance of emerging blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by involving stakeholders in the design process over templates. The goal is to question the promises of blockchain governance happening over automation and smart contracts and to offer an alternative to the misuses of emerging technologies in the so-called predictive and anticipatory design.
   The prototype consists of a functional Node-RED dashboard used as an interface for the Hyperledger smart contracts and a design fiction movie about the lives of the Lithopians.

AB Access control models for the Internet of Things (IoT) proposed in the literature are based on centralized architecture and raise security issues due to the spontaneous and dynamic interaction between IoT devices. In addition to the scalability and lightweight features, the need of secure and distributed access control architecture to overcome the single point failure problem of a centralized entity becomes a big challenge. This can be done through the Blockchain technology which is used recently to provide access control services. Exploiting this technology to manage access IoT devices in term of distribution, heterogeneity, scalability, fault tolerance capability, security and privacy are promising. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the existing access control models based on Blockchain is presented and discussed with comparison and analysis.

AB This work demonstrates how a multi-company shareholder rights management system has been implemented using Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). In this demo(1), we use a permissioned blockchain to store our corporate data, such as the list of all registered companies, each company's shareholders and how many shares everyone holds. It is assumed that the nodes of the blockchain are controlled by the main stakeholder agents but we show that users who do not run a node can still use multiple websites to access company information. On top of this, we show our system can be used to allow any shareholder to participate in elections for company matters. Lastly, we describe how we designed our system's architecture so that it could be implemented even on a public blockchain.

AB The volume of traffic generated by modern Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks suggests that centralized defenses are not the most effective approach to counter these attacks. An alternative to reduce the burden of detection and mitigation is to combine centralized defense systems, creating a global and cooperative protection system. However, existing approaches suffer from the complexity of deployment and operation across different systems. Blockchains appear in this scenario as an alternative to simplify the exchange of information in a cooperative defense. This work evaluates in both local and global experimentations the performance of the blockchain system proposed in [8] concerning the latency to perform the signaling of blacklisted addresses.

AB Lost luggage is one of the main fears when boarding a plane, especially on long flights. Around 10,000 suitcases are lost every day at airports around the world. The proposed solution is to locate much faster and more efficiently the lost object. There are currently a multitude of players involved in this process, who could synchronize by sharing information, which would save airlines costs. This way, the customer and the airline can know where the luggage is at any time.

AB The transmission and tabulation of results are critical steps in the election process. If election results are provided quickly and transparently, they may inspire trust and confidence in the overall management of the contest. On the contrary, the late and questionable delivery of results might raise concerns and suspicion. In some cases, improper counting and tabulation procedures have brought candidates to question election results and even spurred long periods of violence. In this paper, we explore the potential of blockchain technology to enhance the counting and tabulation procedures during elections. Blockchains are distributed ledgers technologies whose transactions are protected cryptographically. It means that their contents cannot be tampered with nor modified in the long term. We argue that blockchain technology meets the requirements for electronic transmission and consolidation of election results. To prove so, we have implemented a proof of concept with a smart contract running on an Ethereum blockchain that registers the address of several polling stations and records the tally sheets that these submit at the end of the election. We also resort to the smart contract for the automatic and accurate consolidation of the election results once they have been submitted.

That led to the increase of the demand on cryptocurrency, which subsequently influenced on its prices a lot. Investors are considering such instrument as an alternative investment, an acceptable substitution to ordinary stocks, bonds or commodities. In that case it becomes necessary to clearly determine the approach of estimation of the intrinsic value of such kind of assets. The article examines what type of asset is closer to the cryptocurrency. Moreover, the extent to which traditional methods of assessing financial assets applicable to the cryptocurrencies is also estimated.

AB The potential of blockchain has been extensively discussed in practitioner literature, yet rigorous empirical and theory-driven information systems (IS) research on blockchain remains scarce. This special issue addresses the need for innovative research that offers a fresh look at the opportunities and challenges of blockchain. This editorial integrates and goes beyond the papers included in this special issue by providing a framework for blockchain research in IS that emphasizes two important issues. First, we direct the attention of IS research toward the blockchain protocol level, which is characterized by recursive interactions between human agents and the blockchain protocol. Second, we highlight the need for IS research to consider how the protocol level constrains and affords blockchain applications, and how these constraints and other concerns at the application level lead to changes at the protocol level. Rooted in a sociomaterial view of IS, we offer a multi-paradigmatic IS research agenda that underscores the need for behavioral (individual, group, and organizational), design science, and IS economics research on blockchain. Our research agenda emphasizes issues of blockchain governance, human and material agency, blockchain affordances and constraints, as well as the consequences of its use.

AB Blockchain is the promising technology of recent years, which has attracted remarkable attention in both academic studies and practical industrial applications. The smart contract is a programmable transaction that can perform a sophisticated task, execute automatically, and store on the blockchain. The smart contract is the key component of the blockchain, which has made blockchain a technology beyond the scope of the cryptocurrencies and applicable for a variety of applications such as healthcare, IoT, supply chain, digital identity, business process management, and more. Although in recent years the progress toward improving blockchain technology with the focus on the smart contract has been impressive, there is a lack of reviewing the smart contract topic. This paper systematically reviews the key concepts and proposes the direction of recent studies and developments regarding the smart contract. The research studies are presented in three main categories: 1) security methods and tools; 2) performance improvement approaches; and 3) decentralized applications based on smart contracts.

AB Protecting and securing data that reside at various hosts in the Internet has become more important than ever before because of the growing number of cyber attacks. Though there have been several studies related to denial of service and cache attacks, those studies are primarily based on simulations and investigations of attacks on real networks are still lacking. In this paper, we experimentally investigated the effects of cache attacks on blockchain based information-centric networks. We used the hyperledger fabric to implement the blockchains for small and medium-sized networks. We implemented cache attacks where the attacker target the cache with unpopular content, forcing the user to fetch the data from the web servers. We experimented with two different topologies ( linear and mesh) and also considered two cache sizes at the nodes. Three cache replacement policies were used: Least Recently Used, Random, and First In First Out. The cache hit, time taken to get the data, and the number of hops to serve the request were obtained with real network traffic. On the hyperledger fabric framework, we implemented two types of requests and showed how the query delay, invoke delay, and update delay vary with time. Based on our results, we find that most of the information centric networks, including the ones based on blockchains, are vulnerable to cache attacks.

TI No Need to Ask: Creating Permissionless Blockchains of Metadata Records

AB This article will describe how permission less metadata blockchains could be created to overcome two significant limitations in current cataloging practices: centralization and a lack of traceability. The process would start by creating public and private keys, which could be managed using digital wallet software. After creating a genesis block, nodes would submit either a new record or modifications to a single record for validation. Validation would rely on a Federated Byzantine Agreement consensus algorithm because it offers the most flexibility for institutions to select authoritative peers. Only the top tier nodes would be required to store a copy of the entire blockchain thereby allowing other institutions to decide whether they prefer to use the abridged version or the full version.

AB In this paper we review and analyze redundancy-based fault-tolerant techniques for the IoT as a paradigm to support two of the main goals of computer security: availability and integrity. We organized the presentation in terms of the three main tasks performed by the nodes of an IoT network: sensing, routing, and control. We first discuss how the implementation of fault-tolerance in the three areas is primary for the correct operation of an entire system. We provide an overview of the different approaches that have been used to address failures in sensing and routing. Control devices typically implement state machines that take decisions based on the measurement of sensors and may also ask actuators to execute actions. Traditionally state-machine replication for fault-tolerance is realized through consensus protocols. Most protocols were developed in the 80's and 90's. We will review the properties of such protocols in detail and discuss their limitations for the IoT. Since 2008, consensus algorithms took a new direction with the introduction of the concept of blockchain. Standard blockchain based protocols cannot be applied without modifications to support fault-tolerance in the IoT. We will review some recent results in this new class of algorithms, and show how they can provide the flexibility required to support fault-tolerance in control devices, and thus overcome some of the limitations of the traditional consensus protocols.

AB Falls are one of the major health concerns for the elderly people. These falls often result in severe injuries which lead into huge medical expenses. Over the recent years, many ICT based fall detection and fall prevention solutions emerged to address the risk factors associated with falls. However, despite of these research studies, predicting the likelihood of falls still remains as a huge challenge in both medical and IT research domains. Data related to these risk factors being scattered among different healthcare providers can be attributed as a main reason for this challenge. This is further amplified by healthcare providers being reluctant to disseminate the data beyond their entities due to the security and privacy concerns. However, in recent years, blockchain has been proven as a promising technology to address the security and privacy challenges in healthcare data exchange as it provides a shared, immutable, and transparent audit trail for accessing data. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to propose a conceptual blockchain based fall prediction model leveraging smart contracts and FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard to identify the elderly people who are at a higher risk of falling.

AB The world monetary system is a mechanism that links the economies of individual countries into a global economy. Therefore, any violations arising in the functioning of the global monetary system lead to significant problems in the development of the economy of separate countriesandthe world economy as a whole. Historically, the world monetary system passed through four stages in its development. The first world monetary system was the gold standard system. The existence of the gold standard prevented inflation and ensured the equilibrium of balance of payments of states. The next stage was the period of the Genoa currency system. During this period, only some currencies including the British pound sterling and the US dollar began to be considered as gold equivalents. The Bretton woods monetary system was adopted in 1944, which consolidated the leading role of the United States and its currency in the world monetary system, due to the post-war economic power of this country. Under this system, only the US dollar was pegged to gold and exchanged for gold at the request of central banks of other countries. The Jamaican currency system replaced the Bretton woods monetary system in 1971. According to the new system, the rate of the currency of each country began to change according to changes in supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The modern monetary system is based on the functioning of two currencies, the US dollar and the Euro. Unfortunately, exchange rate fluctuations of these leading currencies negatively affect the economies of other countries. Some experts consider cryptocurrency as the global currency of the future global monetary system. The current situation in the global economy confirms that the world monetary system will inevitably be transformed and this process will be long, ambiguous and possibly not predictable.

AB Routing on the Internet is defined among autonomous systems (ASes) based on a weak trust model where it is assumed that ASes are honest. While this trust model strengthens the connectivity among ASes, it results in an attack surface which is exploited by malicious entities to hijacking routing paths. One such attack is known as the BGP prefix hijacking, in which a malicious AS broadcasts IP prefixes that belong to a target AS, thereby hijacking its traffic. In this paper, we propose RouteChain: a blockchain-based secure BGP routing system that counters BGP hijacking and maintains a consistent view of the Internet routing paths. Towards that, we leverage provenance assurance and tamper-proof properties of blockchains to augment trust among ASes. We group ASes based on their geographical (network) proximity and construct a bi-hierarchical blockchain model that detects false prefixes prior to their spread over the Internet. We validate strengths of our design by simulations and show its effectiveness by drawing a case study with the Youtube hijacking of 2008. Our proposed scheme is a standalone service that can be incrementally deployed without the need of a central authority.

Towards that end, we study such an attack on Bitcoin mempool and explore its effects on transactions fee paid by legitimate users. We also propose countermeasures to contain such an attack. Our countermeasures include fee-based and age-based designs, which optimize the mempool size and help in countering the effects of DDoS attacks. We further evaluate our designs by simulations and analyze their usefulness in varying attack conditions. Our analyses can be extended to other blockchain-based applications which use memory pools to cache network activities.

AB Selfish mining is a well known vulnerability in blockchains exploited by miners to steal block rewards. In this paper, we explore a new form of selfish mining attack that guarantees high rewards with low cost. We show the feasibility of this attack facilitated by recent developments in blockchain technology opening new attack avenues. By outlining the limitations of existing countermeasures, we highlight a need for new defense strategies to counter this attack, and leverage key system parameters in blockchain applications to propose an algorithm that enforces fair mining. We use the expected transaction confirmation height and block publishing height to detect selfish mining behavior and develop a network-wide defense mechanism to disincentivize selfish miners. Our design involves a simple modifications to transactions' data structure in order to obtain a "truth state" used to catch the selfish miners and prevent honest miners from losing block rewards.

AB Blockchain was only used as a foundation of cryptocurrency initially, but today, we can see the rise of this new emerging technology being implemented in many industries. In the future, most technologies around the world are expected to use blockchain as an efficient way to make online transactions. One of the areas that blockchain technologies can be applied is crowdfunding platforms. The most common problem with current crowdfunding scene in Malaysia (and around the world) is that the campaigns are not regulated and some of the crowd-funding campaign turned out to be fraud. Besides, the completion of some projects also was significantly delayed. This project aims to solve these problems by applying Ethereum smart contracts to the crowdfunding site to that the contracts will be fully automatically executed, thus preventing frauds and ensuring that the projects can be delivered within duration given.

TI Transformation of Blockchain as Social Good
SO HELIX
AB Blockchain is currently considered as a key technology that can significantly reduce the level of transaction costs in the economy, reduce the level of economic and financial risks, and increase the efficiency of economy and financial sector.
   In this regard, it is relevant to study the possible trajectories of blockchain transformation under conditions when the state has not yet developed a universal model for blockchain integration into the economic system.
   The blockchain research method as a good is represented by economic sociodynamics, which studies the typology of goods and their transitions under the influence of interests that society presents to a particular product or service. The models of dynamics of social groups of M. Olsen and R. Putnam are also used.
   The endowment of blockchain with the features of a social good by the state shall not be accompanied by the deprivation of blockchain of the properties of a private good that can satisfy private, not just public interests. This will create conditions for increasing the share of Putnam's groups and reducing the share of Olsen's groups, which will increase the level of trust in society and stimulate the improvement of macroeconomic indicators, such as economic growth and increase in the GDP investment share.

IoT applications is expected to have difficulties in security and privacy issues in the near future. Speed improvement of quantum computers threatens the crypto algorithms used. Strong Mathematics encryption algorithms in today's world can cause weaknesses later. They can be solved by the computers which have large enough transaction volume in the labs. Changes in technology require the change in approaches to security solutions. Smart objects can be managed over the network, including critical applications. The basis of security on data lies in the science of cryptography. Privacy and fidelity of data collected over IoT and its accurate transmission are very important. This study provides an approach on reliability of next-generation encryption algorithm in the context of objects' relativity.

AB Subsequent to the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency has seen unprecedented growth. Mobile applications known as wallets often facilitate user interaction to these cryptocurrencies. With a perceived real world value these wallets are a target for attackers. Unlike mainstream financial services applications, cryptocurrency wallets are not subject to the same stringent security requirements of their regulated counterparts. In this paper, we examine the security profiles of commonly used Android cryptocurrency applications. We examine these applications for common vulnerabilities outlined by OWASP mobile top 10. We establish a baseline for our tests by evaluating commonly used banking and trading applications. We compare the results from our baseline test and establish the state of security provided by cryptocurrency wallet applications. The paper also examines the possible privacy implications of mobile applications. We report that the conventional financial services applications are only marginally better than cryptocurrency application in security provisions but they provide greater privacy.

AB This paper considers the development of attractive strategies featuring cryptocurrency assets, considering their costs and potential risks. The object of analysis in this paper is cryptocurrency as an investment instrument. The main hypothesis of the research is that modern portfolio theory can be applied to cryptocurrency investments to design an investment portfolio with appropriate risk and profitability characteristics. The authors of the paper: (i) place cryptocurrencies in the context of modern financial market and financial technology development; (ii) develop assessment criteria for determining attractiveness of individual cryptocurrencies; and (iii) develop recommendations for creating an optimal cryptocurrency investment portfolio. In order to test the hypothesis, the authors performed calculations and used such methods of scientific research as the collection and processing historical values for cryptocurrency rates from July 2017 to January 2018, as well as data analysis for correlation, covariance, and return on investment. It is shown that a cryptocurrency investment portfolio should be created considering investor objectives and should obey a logical relationship between risk and profitability. Therefore, cryptocurrencies should not be correlated; an investment portfolio should be sufficiently diversified to minimize risk; cryptocurrencies should be liquid, that is freely exchangeable to a fiat currency on an appropriate exchange (e.g. dollars, euros). Investors should also consider regular rebalancing of the portfolio, which could help increase its profitability.

AB Along with the increase in international travel there is a consequential rise in the amount of leftover currency (LFC) or the paper bills/coins that people cannot spend during their international travel. This cash mostly stay in people's pockets and travels back to people's home country. There are ways that LFC can be brought back into the economy such as souvenir shopping at the airports, donations to a charity wending machine or throwing into fountains to wish. However, these means of utilization have various limitations associated with them. Hence, there is a need for a transparent and a more convenient method to spend the LFC. In this work, we implement a system that solves the LFC problem by converting it into a cryptocurrency. The process of conversion requires depositing the LFC at a kiosk. The users can then use an android application to receive the cryptocurrency which they deposit in the foreign country. The amount of cryptocurrency bought by current rate appears in the users' e-wallet. The kiosk backend handles the currency and storage of critical transactions in a blockchain. The proposed system gives a fairly simple solution for a long lasting problem that is only possible because of the blockchain technology.

AB Security is nonnegotiable key point for in-vehicle networking. However, all communication between Electrical Control Unites (ECU) still suffer from security drawbacks like highly processing time or preserving confidentiality, integrity and authenticity. In this paper, we propose an approach to assess the feasibility of a private Blockchain technology to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks. In this approach, we consider in-vehicle networking contains two parts, namely, central (or connected) gateway (cGW) and switches. cGW and switches are Blockchain nodes, wherein Blockchain consensus protocols are what keep all the nodes on a network synchronized with each other. The approach considers any communication type between ECUs as an individual event, which can be a transaction, data entry or application execution. A use case of secure communication between two ECUs is presented as an evaluation mechanism for securing in-vehicle networking using the proposed Blockchain approach.

This research uses as a theoretical background the Technology Acceptance Model, strongly inspired by the statistical modeling of Abramova and Bohme (2016), with the inclusion of theoretical constructs: Perceived Benefit, Perceived Use Ease, Perceived Risk. These constructs aim to explain the endogenous construct Possibility and Use Behavior and significant determinants, using the multivariate statistical method of modeling Structural Equations. The results demonstrate that the benefit perceived by the individual is the main factor that positively influences the users of cryptocurrency. In addition, the risks perceived by the individuals were not significant for the results, divergent than expected, from the determinants financial losses, legal risk and operational risk.

AB The idea of connecting physical things and cyber components to enable new and richer interactions is a key component in any smart space concept. One of the central challenges in these new smart spaces is the access control of data, services and things. In recent years, Distributed Ledger technology (DLT) like Blockchain Technology (BCT), emerged as the most promising solution for decentralized access management. Using capability-based access control, access to data/services/things is achieved by transferring tokens between the accounts of a distributed ledger. Managing how the access tokens are transferred is, of course, a major challenge. Within the IoT space, smart contracts are at the center of most of the proposals for DLT/BCT networks targeting access control. The main problem in using smart contracts as a means for checking if and what access token can be transferred from one account to another is their immutability and accessibility. Smart contracts and chain code are by design meant to be immutable since they represent a binding contract between parties. In addition, they need to be accessible since they are to be executed on many nodes. This allows an attacker to study them and design the attack in a manner that passes the rules of the smart contract/chain code. This paper focuses on the use of metadata as a more effective means to prevent attackers from gaining access to data/services/things in a smart living space.

TI DIGITAL FINANCIAL ASSETS: SEGMENTS AND PROSPECTS OF LEGAL REGULATION IN
   THE BRICS COUNTRIES
SO BRICS LAW JOURNAL
AB In the environment of the current trend towards digitalization of the world economy, the issue of the legal regulation of the institute of digital financial assets as well as the activity relating to the generation of these assets is of considerable interest. As practice shows, individual countries face the situation where these assets are already turning over, but there is still no legal regulation. This state of affairs may give rise to cases of illegal turnover of financial assets and fraud in this sphere. Presently, the geopolitical map on digitalization of the economy is fragmented. Some countries have recognized and legalized the turnover of digital financial assets, others have so far not adopted an unambiguous attitude with respect to this new institute, while a third group of countries has not even recognized their legal nature nor their very existence. This ambiguity raises many issues relating to the legitimacy of digital financial assets and the feasibility of the introduction of this new financial product. The article analyzes the state of the legal regulation of the institute of digital financial assets in the BR/CS countries, considers the standpoints of legislators and scientists on the legal nature of these financial assets.

AB Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence models are created, trained and used by different entities. The entity that curates data used for the model is frequently different from the entity that trains the model, which is different yet again from the end user of the trained model. The end user needs to trust the received AI model, and this requires having the provenance information about how the model was trained, and the data the model was trained on. This chapter describes how blockchain can be used to track the provenance of training models, leading to better trusted Artificial Intelligence.

AB Electronic transactions with cryptocurrency systems based on blockchain in our days have become very popular due to the good reputation of this technology. However, that good reputation cannot deny the serious anomalies and the risks that can cause these cryptocurrencies. In this work, we propose a new model for anomaly detection over bitcoin electronic transactions. We used in our proposal two machine learning algorithms, namely the One Class Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) algorithm to detect outliers and the K-Means algorithm in order to group the similar outliers with the same type of anomalies. We evaluated our work by generating detection results and we obtained high performance results on accuracy.

AB Today a massive amount of data is used for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to derive knowledge about the world and do automated decision making. All this data contains personal and/or sensitive data, and thus privacy is becoming more and more important. The European Union's GDPR [9] recognizes the importance of transparency with respect to the handling of personal data. Hence it is desirable to devise means for increasing the transparency of personal data handling within an organization besides documenting processes of personal data handling. We employ blockchains as a basic building block to increase transparency with respect to personal data handling. A public blockchain serves as a trust anchor for a private blockchain, whereas the private blockchain serves as a log storage for the handling (i.e., access to and processing of) of personal and/or sensitive data. By giving the customer access to the private blockchain the customer's trust in the enterprise is increased.

AB Blockchain technology is developing at a rapid pace. For consumers that are only interested in simplifying processes and reducing costs by using a blockchain solution a new problem has occurred. It is not only necessary to select the appropriate solution, but also to configure and operate considering blockchain interoperability with different chains. For the industry, there is a need for solutions based on open standards. This paper proposes a Policy-based Blockchain Agnostic Framework that not only connects different blockchains but also facilitates their configuration and operation. Moreover, a case study is presented considering the cold-chain supply-chain, where each actor defines its policies based on blockchain requirements.

AB Service Level Agreements (SLA) are documents that specify what Service Providers (SP) are delivering to customers. They contain information about the service, such as target performance level or monthly availability, and penalties for the violations of the SLA. The information about the penalties is essential because if the SP does not deliver what is defined, the customer must be compensated accordingly. However, the current compensation process is cumbersome and complex because of the amount of involved manual effort. To address this issue, it is proposed in this paper an approach based on blockchain and Smart Contracts (SC) to automate the compensation process while enabling dynamic payments during the SLA lifetime. The proposed approach was evaluated in an use case that simulates the management of a Quality of Service SLA between an SP and a customer. Based on the performed evaluation, parts of the SLA management process were successfully automated using a decentralized solution, and the payment of the compensation occurred without the intervention of a third party.

AB The Data Market Austria (DMA) is an ecosystem of federated data and service infrastructures. It aims at establishing a market platform where data assets can be made accessible and offered for purchase. To support this, the DMA offers a central portal with catalogue and search services as well as a set of microservices for metadata mapping or enrichment, data quality assessment, data set submission, storage, management, and dissemination. The DMA relies on blockchain technology to allow a network of DMA members sharing information about the provenance and trading of datasets and services. This paper describes the blockchain application scenarios and the implementation of the blockchain-based distributed setup of the DMA.

TI Decentralization: an incomplete ambition
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB Decentralization is a term widely used in a variety of contexts, particularly in political science and discourses surrounding the Internet. It is popular today among advocates of blockchain technology. While frequently employed as if it were a technical term, decentralization more reliably appears to operate as a rhetorical strategy that directs attention toward some aspects of a proposed social order and away from others. It is called for far more than it is theorized or consistently defined. This nonspecificity has served to draw diverse participants into common political and technological projects. Yet even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate about how such power should operate. For decentralization to be a reliable concept in formulating future social arrangements and related technologies, it should come with high standards of specificity. It also cannot substitute for anticipating centralization with appropriate mechanisms of accountability.

AB Blockchain innovations are having a profound effect on the global financial industry, yet little is known about how the emerging technology can potentially disrupt other industries. The supply chain industry represents a prominent and very promising application scenario for blockchain to enable transparency among untrusted stakeholders as well as increased efficiency and traceability throughout production and distribution processes, however there is a lack of empirical research available in that field. The primary purpose of this research is to address that research gap by exploring the application of blockchain technologies in supply chains. First, this research examines recent literature to identify current inefficiencies in existing supply chain information technologies. Secondly, key features of blockchain are identified to provide a clear understanding of the technology. Thirdly, current applications are documented and categorized to identify where blockchain applications can have the most impact on the three flows of the supply chain. The analysis shows most of the process areas in supply chain that blockchain is expected to improve are informational, which given the large amount of interdependencies between flows, has a positive impact on the subsequent financial and material flows. Finally, recommendations for future research are given to address further research questions.

AB The past few years have witnessed the explosive growth of mobile user equipment (UEs) and the popularity of computation-intensive applications, leading to a mobile edge computing paradigm for Ultra-dense wireless networks (UDNs). Since numerous UEs need to offload a large amount of computation tasks to edge servers/UEs, it is very challenging to coordinate computation offloading among UEs and edge servers in UDNs. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized computation offloading coordination platform that is based on the blockchain. Specifically, we first establish a blockchain platform for announcing computation offloading requests and coordinate computation offloading among UEs and edge servers. Then, we develop a modified GS-based user matching algorithm to find the matching relationship between offloading requester's computation tasks and the edge server/UEs. In particular, user matching is based on task execution time and energy consumption. We conduct simulations and provide extensive simulation results to show the significant performance improvement achieved by the proposed offloading scheme.

AB In a typical consumer electronics generation, diverse forms of attacks exist, e.g., system security, information security, information privacy, system trustworthiness, hardware IP protection, information copyright protection. Each of the attacks have their own threats and serve different purposes. Objective of this chapter is to differentiate each of these attacks in the context of internet of things (IoT). IoT is a very hot, trending topic of research, where different devices, sensors, and computers are connected to a network, collect data, and process for different purposes. A network of devices and sensors connected to the cloud can complete many unimaginable tasks, and without the existence of cloud, almost all task would have been very difficult to achieve and complete. Since, most connectivity occurs in cloud, there is always a probability of security and privacy threats. Because all types of the different devices are connected to the internet, attackers pose a huge threat to the system. For example, if any electronic system that is responsible for home care, healthcare, running an entire city, etc., are attacked, then the consequence of this threat will be a major catastrophe.
   This chapter is organized as follows: Section 2.1 presents an introduction and broad overview of IoT; Section 2.2 presents a broad view of security, energy, and cost trade-offs in consumer electronic systems; Section 2.3 presents different security threats and solutions to the memory modules of the system; Section 2.4 provides different threats and solutions to the radio-frequency identification (RFID) modules; Section 2.5 provides security flaws and how to mitigate them in an near-field communication (NFC) module of the system; Section 2.6 discusses different security flaws in the smart vehicles, the autonomous cars, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); Section 2.7 discusses different ways on how an attacker can attack a healthcare device and provides solutions for some of the attacks; Section 2.8 discusses the threats on firmware of the devices; and Section 2.9 discusses the emerging technology of blockchain, its advantages, and issues. The conclusion and future directions are presented in Section 2.10.

AB This paper presents the Random Neural Network in a Deep Learning Cluster structure with a new learning algorithm based on the genome model, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves. The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast and local decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the learned information to future generations. This structure has been applied and validated in Fintech, a Bitcoin Smart Investment application based in an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk. Our results are promising; we have connected the human brain and genetics with Machine Learning based on the Random Neural Network model where Artificial Intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) devices currently rely on centralized, brokered conununication models which call for a number of security flaws and threats. Privacy & security remain a challenge owing to the existing systems being centralized creating a single point of failure. In this paper, we lay out an architecture for incorporating a concept similar to Blockchain the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to provide decentralized security and privacy for loT devices. Currently, the issue with most loT devices is that they lack the processing power, storage and computational overhead to run consensus algorithms to be an active part of the Blockchain network The current issue with the blockchain on the other hand, is its low scalability and low number of transactions per second. We present an innovative approach using a technology called IOTA. This addresses some of the most important problems with existing blockchain infrastructure such as being able to run on lightweight devices with constrained memory. We eliminate transaction fees and the concept of mining which requires a large amount of processing power to compete with other miners. IOTA's main component is the Tangle, a guided acyclic graph (DAG) for transaction storage. We discuss creation of two IoT applications on the tangle - a smart utility meter system and a smart car transaction system which are connected to internet through Low Power Wide Area IoT networks.

AB This paper explores a methodology for training recurrent neural networks in replicating path planning solutions from optimization problems of multi-agent systems. Training data is generated by solving a centralized nonlinear programming problem, from which both centralized (representing all agents) and decentralized (representing individual agents) recurrent neural networks are trained with reinforcement learning to produce an agent's state path through fixed time-step execution. Path-tracking controllers are formulated for each agent to follow the path generated by the network. The control signal from such a controller should mimic that of the optimized solution. Results for a 10 agent, 2D dynamics problem with synchronized arrival and collision avoidance constraints showcase the ability of this approach to achieve the desired controller execution and resulting state path. Through these results, this work showcases the ability of recurrent neural networks to learn and generalize centralized and synchronous multi-agent optimization solutions, the end of which is a much more computationally fast multi-agent path planner that trends the slower-to-compute optimization solutions.

AB Future blockchain applications are anticipated to serve millions of users. Thus the evaluation of new blockchain applications have to consider large-scale assessment of the technologies behind the scene. Most of current testing approaches have been done either on simulators or via local small blockchain networks. Hence, the performance in real world conditions is unpredictable. This demonstration introduces BlockZoom, a large-scale blockchain testbed that runs on top of a highly reconfigurable and controllable HPC platform. BlockZoom presents a reproducible environment for experimenting distributed ledgers technologies and smart contract applications. Through different configuration scenarios developers can evaluate the applications performance and the blockchain behavior at a scale comparable to the production environment. The target audience of this demonstration includes researchers and developers in blockchain technology.

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has been widely used because of its high efficiency and real-time collaboration. A wireless sensor network is the core technology to support the operation of the IoT, and the security problem is becoming more and more serious. Aiming at the problem that the existing malicious node detection methods in wireless sensor networks cannot be guaranteed by fairness and traceability of detection process, we present a blockchain trust model (BTM) for malicious node detection in wireless sensor networks. First, it gives the whole framework of the trust model. Then, it constructs the blockchain data structure which is used to detect malicious nodes. Finally, it realizes the detection of malicious nodes in 3D space by using the blockchain smart contract and the WSNs' quadrilateral measurement localization method, and the voting consensus results are recorded in the blockchain distributed. The simulation results show that the model can effectively detect malicious nodes in WSNs, and it can also ensure the traceability of the detection process.

TI Efficient and Unconditionally Anonymous Certificateless Provable Data
   Possession Scheme With Trusted KGC for Cloud-Based EMRs
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) are the collection of patient's health data systematically in a digital format. They eliminate the complicated paper-based medical records and ensure the accuracy and legibility of health data to improve quality care. As the amount of the EMRs explosion, the traditional medical system is unable to equip with sufficient storage and computing capacities. Therefore, it is crucial to outsourcing this EMRs to the cloud server, which is a flexible and cost-effective mode in data management. However, the loss of control over the patient's EMRs makes it a severe challenge in the integrity of outsourced data. In this paper, we propose an efficient certificateless provable data possession (CL-PDP) scheme without bilinear pairing for the EMRs stored in the cloud medical server. A formal security proof on the random oracle model demonstrates the security of our proposal. In addition, our CL-PDP protocol satisfies the following properties: unconditionally anonymous, privacy preservation, public verifiability, and reliability of the trusted third party. At last, an elaborate performance evaluation with other related schemes shows that this proposal is efficient and practical.

TI Dynamic Distributed Honeypot Based on Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Honeypot technology can be applied to efficiently attract attackers and exhaust their resources. However, the traditional static honeypot is easy to be recognized by anti-honeypot technology. By contrast, most of the dynamic honeypots can simulate the real system in time, thus interacting with an intruder in disguise. In this paper, we employ the dynamic property of honeypot in four kinds of services of our system. However, this dynamic property shows up in a location and identification, indicating that genuine or fake services (honeypots) are changeable in different hosts. Thus, the dynamic property of our system differs from the dynamic honeypot aforementioned. Besides, we adopt the blockchain platform (Ethereum) to decentralize our system and store the port access data by delivering a private chain. To illustrate the effectiveness of our scheme in theory and practice, security analysis, eavesdropping attack, scanning attack, and DoS attack experiments are conducted. The results show that our scheme is valid in safeguarding against network attack.

TI DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF GLOBAL BANKING: CHALLENGES AND PROSPECTS
SO FINANCIAL AND CREDIT ACTIVITY-PROBLEMS OF THEORY AND PRACTICE
AB Based on the analysis of trends and threats of digital transformation of global banking, we concluded that there is an unevenness of digitization of banking in different regions. The development of digital technology has an impact on the global banking market, its structure and services. Cloud technology, blockchain and Big Data, artificial intelligence, biometrics, and open source APIs are used by financial institutions both in routine client work (optical character recognition, language, voice, customer image and face recognition, etc.), and in complex analysis of unstructured data sets (pattern recognition in money laundering transactions, counter-terrorism financing). The major segments where the biggest changes were made - are retail, corporate banking, payments, bank transactions, investment banking, and infrastructure projects. There are considered the concept of open banking, its impact on the ecosystem of financial market. The use of digital technologies, on the one hand, increases competition and market efficiency, and on the other, creates new systemic risks to financial stability and integrity.
   The main obstacles to digital transformation are not technological ones, but the differences in the organizational culture of traditional banks and fintech, different strategic vision of top management, lack of qualified personnel, which makes it difficult for banks to transform for cooperation. The use of digital technology increases the systemic risks associated with cyber security, fraud and ethical issues. In order to reduce the fraud, it is important to improve the verification procedures: the integration of offline and online modes, the use of implicit factors, and consumer biometric behaviour. Given the likelihood of recession in the coming years, geopolitical problems, trade and currency wars, traditional banks need to transform their businesses in line with new trends. In modern global world, there are not the largest banks that the competitive advantages get but the ones that are the most adapted to changes.

TI A Fog Computing-Based Architecture for Medical Records Management
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The aging of the world's population and the growth in the number of people with chronic diseases have increased expenses with medical care. Thus, the use of technological solutions has been widely adopted in the medical field to improve the patients' health. In this context, approaches based on Cloud Computing have been used to store and process the information generated in these solutions. However, using Cloud can create delays that are intolerable for medical applications. Thus, the Fog Computing paradigm emerged as an alternative to overcome this problem, bringing computation and storage closer to the data sources. However, managing medical data stored in Fog is still a challenge. Moreover, characteristics of availability, performance, interoperability, and privacy need to be considered in approaches that aim to explore this problem. So, this article shows a software architecture based on Fog Computing and designed to facilitate the management of medical records. This architecture uses Blockchain concepts to provide the necessary privacy features and to allow Fog Nodes to carry out the authorization process in a distributed way. Finally, this paper describes a case study that evaluates the performance, privacy, and interoperability requirements of the proposed architecture in a home-centered healthcare scenario.

AB A key characteristic of Smart Cities is the ability to improve decision making by combining the maximum possible information provided by sensors or people. This paper presents a Blockchain-based reputation system for allowing citizens to assess the quality of information shared by other participating citizens. Citizens have the possibility to confirm or refute information posted by others, and the reputation of participants has a role in the final credibility of the information shared. Individual reputation is used as a "currency", citizens bet with their reputation when giving an opinion, and get some reputation back when they are considered to be right. The reputation system is supervised by municipality stakeholders, which have the role of giving a final decision on the quality of the information and, consequently, in the update of the reputations associated with it. Stakeholders use Blockchain technology as a natural solution to spread their power regarding reputation management, ensuring a trustworthy dissemination of information, for instance, when reporting accidents.

AB Information exchange among architects, contractors, and clients is found to be limited and not completely digital, which creates difficulty in tracking and analyzing the generated unstructured data. Design drawings are developed during the design phase, but not transparently shared among contractors, due to the fear of uncertain changes in design without knowing who changed the designed element and what element is been modified, which can lead to disputes. Blockchain technology enables the transaction of digital information, and revolutionizing different industries like banking, crypto exchanges, insurance, etc., due to its decentralized, encrypted, and secured functionality. This paper proposes the potential application of blockchain technology in design development phase of architecture, engineering, and construction ( AEC) processes by developing a blockchain framework. In this research, the design data generated from design development software and its log files are categorized, and flow of data encryption is determined by using blockchain concepts in order to have a secure ledger, which has the potential to provide a validation to an argument of disputes. The expected contribution of this proposed research is to create a framework to track and register the design commands and events in a secured, transparent, and collaborative platform. The anticipated benefits of this research include the record of proof of work and the mitigation of disputes and litigations related to design defects which includes design error and omissions and construction defects which includes either replacement or modifications in design, resulting to change orders and monetary losses.

AB We present and evaluate models that allow clients to access IoT resources using secure and trusted device-to-device (D2D) communication, while utilizing smart contracts to obtain the benefits of blockcain technology. These benefits include decentralized trust, immutability, transparency, and high availability. The models consider different network connection capabilities of the clients and the IoT resources, namely continuous network connectivity and D2D-only connectivity. We describe two approaches for utilizing blockchains and smart contracts in the authorization process: in the first approach, only hashes of the authorization information are recorded on the blockchain. In the second approach, a smart contract handles authorization requests. We implement the approaches using the OAuth 2.0 delegated authorization framework and evaluate the implementations on the public Ethereum testnet Rinkeby, in terms of execution cost, contract creation cost, and delay. Our evaluation quantifies the tradeoffs of blockchain cost and smart contract functionality, such as blocking and non-blocking operation, and the reduction of the transaction cost that can be achieved when multiple authorization requests are concatenated in a single transaction.

The models involve different trade-offs in terms of privacy, delay, and cost, while exploiting key advantages of blockchains and smart contracts. These include linking payments to authorization grants, immutably recording authorization information and policies in smart contracts, and offering resilience through the execution of smart contract code on all blockchain nodes.

TI Interledger Approaches
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB While blockchains and more generally distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are passing over their hype curve peak, their shortcomings are becoming more apparent. One relatively recent approach to address their performance, scalability, privacy, and other problems are to use multiple different DLTs instead of relying on just one. While there are no really established standards for combining several DLTs, a few repeating patterns can be observed. In this paper, we present a survey of interledger approaches, discussing and comparing their underlying mechanisms. A shared motivation for all of the discussed interledger solutions is to move away from the "one chain rules them all" model to one that allows the interconnection of multiple ledgers, with different features and advantages, while also supporting innovation. The interledger approaches discussed in this survey include 1) atomic cross-chain transactions, 2) transactions across a network of payment channels, 3) the W3C Interledger Protocol (ILP), 4) bridging, 5) sidechains, and 6) ledger-of-ledgers. The approaches are compared according to whether they support the transfer or the exchange of value, their interconnection trust mechanism, complexity, scalability, and transaction cost.

TI DECISION SUPPORT IN SOCIO-CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS: CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
   AND DECISION MAKING STAGES
SO COMPTES RENDUS DE L ACADEMIE BULGARE DES SCIENCES
AB The aim of the present research is to develop a conceptual framework to support decision making in socio-cyber-physical systems. The framework develops the idea that initially cyber components of a system make decisions, and if they cannot do this, they ask human for help. Agreements between the cyber components on decision implementation are regulated by smart contracts. The application of the developed framework and the proposed decision support models is illustrated through a scenario in which robots plan joint actions on task execution. The conceptual framework enables to organize collaboration of cyber objects and humans in socio-cyber-physical systems. The reported results contribute to overcoming the consequences of the emergent behaviour of such systems.

For raising awareness on the Bitcoin reward system, a new attack scheme is proposed, where the attackers infiltrate into an open pool and launch the selfish mining as well as the block withholding attack. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed attack outperforms the conventional block withholding attacks.

SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE INOVACAO
AB According to the World Economic Forum, the water crisis ranks among the five most dangerous risks to global welfare. In this context, water governance is becoming increasingly vital in various regions, especially as the multiple and competitive uses of water mount increasing pressures on its supply. Despite the evolution of water governance rationales, global water resources are, unfortunately deteriorating. Current water governance models are limited by two intertwined aspects: financial sources and trust. In this context, the objective of this paper is to discuss how blockchain technology can aid in improving water governance, increasing financial transparency, and stakeholders' trust. Such an improvement could be achieved, for example, with the creation of cryptocurrencies to encourage actions aimed at the conservation of water resources, and also via the adoption of smart contracts.

AB This paper researches the building principles and administration of virtual data processing centers based on hyper-converged systems over Open Flow. We provide the implementation features of such virtual centers on the basis of software-defined networking that is managed by a dedicated controller (a server). We suggest the graph administration model of hyper-converged system resources compliant with required performance on the one hand and economic requirements on the other. Based on the proposed model, the implementation of a greedy control algorithm for the virtual data processing center over OpenFlow was examined. This algorithm assigns the requests to physical resources by using of dedicated server software. The advantages of such hyper-converged system model on performance issues were outlined, e.g., multi-threaded routing and security, elimination of the majority of current threats. We summarize the possibilities of transition to network infrastructure in these virtual data processing centers. Such infrastructure is focused on data and usage of blockchain technology providing high reliability and content protection.

AB Following the recent increase in smart factories and smart cities and the fourth industrial revolution, the number of IoT devices has been increasing and accordingly, the security of IoT devices has also become an important issue. However, due to reasons such as the low performance of IoT devices, the currently existing security solutions can be hardly applied and even if safe firmware is supplied, security problems may arise due to attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks and roll-back attacks. To resolve such problems, we propose a new firmware management architecture using blockchains and IPFS (The InterPlanetary File System). Using IPFS can ensure the integrity of the firmware. However, IoT device version management and IPFS URL integrity cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, IoT devices are enabled to be provided with firmware information and updated through blockchian networks to ensure the integrity of the IPFS URL, and an IoT devices management function is provided. The proposed system enables safe firmware distribution and update, and IoT devices' security level is expected to be higher. Through the proposed system, safe firmware distribution and update will become possible and IoT device security levels are expected to be enhanced.

With the advent of smartphones, social media platforms have become an undeniably popular way to communicate with people across the world. However, fake news and maliciously fabricated screenshots are continuously produced and distributed on social media. Since blockchain technology can store data in a secure and tamper-proof way, it is a suitable platform for notarizing online activity. The problem is how we can verify the data to notarize. We propose an architecture that can authentically archive the contents on social media using blockchain technology. Based on the proposed method, an instant messaging scenario is presented as a proof-of-concept.

AB This short paper recovers the term 'imaginaries' which is often used in the social sciences to describe a meaning system that frames individuals lived experience of an inordinately complex world. The paper goes on to reflect on the extent to which design has the capability to disrupt imaginaries through the development of products in order for people to construct new ones, or whether the discipline is perpetuating old models of the world. The paper uses a workshop method to explore socioeconomic models in order to better balance the multiple imaginaries that participants hold with the opportunity to design disruptive and critical propositions. Reflections upon the workshop and the concept of imaginaries allows the authors to identify a challenge for design in which it must accept its role as mediator and exacerbator.

AB In 2013 a new fund-raising modality was born. It's called Initial Coin Offering (ICO), it's based on blockchain technology and requires a significant enterprise business model review. ICO is not only a new financing approach; through token issue, it permits to establish a wide range of direct relationships between interested counterparts as entrepreneurs, investors, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders; this set of relationships can generate several types of token-based communities depending on each ICO specific goals. ICO is under regulation in several countries and one of the first is Switzerland through government and FINMA ICO Guidelines, which supplies an institutional and legal framework. Given that ICO is recently born and there is a lack of well-defined standards and phenomenon comprehension, investors are not yet confident to operate in this market. In order to face this matter, a deep knowledge of operative mechanisms and a consolidation of standards for fully potential exploitation are needed. The goal of this Paper is to integrate in an innovative way enterprise Business Model, Business Plan and Communication Plan with the Token Plan in order to exploit the ICO critical success factors. As deliverable the Paper identifies some critical factors and furnishes a set of key recommendations, suggestions and guidelines for a successful ICO.

AB The development of patients' electronic healthcare records has been hampered by bureaucracy and by heavy regulation within the medical field. Medical data recorded in a patient health records is a valuable source of information that can be used by doctors and researchers to improve the quality of healthcare and the quality of life. Medical data should be owned and controlled by the patient instead of being scattered in different healthcare systems that does not support transfer and semantic interoperability between different healthcare providers. Blockchain technology has demonstrated in the financial field that it is possible to create a safe, secure and auditable mechanism by using a decentralized network along with a public ledger. But with the adoption of the newly General Data Protection Regulation, all technological advances discovered by the Blockchain are now blocked. In this paper we present the main aspect of the GDPR and Blockchain technology in healthcare and a way in which this two can work together.

AB The integrity of executable binaries is essential to the security of any device that runs them. At best, a manipulated binary can leave the system in question open to attack, and at worst, it can compromise the entire system by itself. In recent years, supply-chain attacks have demonstrated that binaries can even be compromised unbeknownst to their creators. This, in turn, leads to the dissemination of supposedly valid binaries that need to be revoked later.
   In this paper, we present and evaluate a concept for publishing and revoking integrity protecting information for binaries, based on the Ethereum Blockchain and its underlying peer-to-peer network. Smart Contracts are used to enforce access control over the publication and revocation of integrity preserving information, whereas the peer-to-peer network serves as a fast, global communication service to keep user clients informed. The Ethereum Blockchain serves as a tamper-evident, publicly-verifiable log of published and revoked binaries. Our implementation incurs costs comparable to registration fees for centralised software distribution platforms but allows publication and revocation of individual binaries within minutes. The proposed concept can be integrated incrementally into existing software distribution platforms, such as package repositories or various app stores.

TI BLOCKCHAIN IN DIGITAL CRIMINOLOGY: PROBLEM STATEMENT
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB The problem under consideration is highly topical as damage from cybercrime is predicted to reach six trillion dollar in 2021, compared with 3 trillion in 2015. The authors put forth a hypothesis that blockchain could become the technology that will reduce the scale of damage from criminal infringements in the sphere of digital economy by simplifying control over illegal movement of capital. The goal of this research is to analyze the role that the technology of distributed registers/blockchain plays in digital criminology and counteracting cybercrime. In blockchain, there is no single point of attack on the database, and it is impossible to access data encrypted with a key without that key. There is not centralized storage for keys: each user-owner stores them. The authors study the technology of storing data in blockchain or distributed register (blockchain being a special case of distributed register). If such a server center is attacked, it is impossible to steal all data that are stored on it at once. This will deliver a serious blow on the criminal transactions because the whole history of operations is saved, the financial flows are transparent in the chain of blocks and it will be virtually impossible to hide them, which will eliminate all illegal transactions and make the financing of terrorist and extremist organizations much more difficult. Because all users-owners have the database, the theft will be noticed immediately, and it cannot be hidden. It will get known whose secret key is used for access, and it will point directly at the perpetrator and could, in itself, stop them. The authors describe how distributed registers can be used to fight cybercrime. They believe that 1) the problem of cybercrime is most relevant for developed countries (with high GDP) because the more developed a society is, the more it depends on digital technologies; 2) the distributed registers/blockchain technology will help counteract cyberattacks and, consequently, will protect finances and confidential information against criminal infringements.

AB The article discusses the main approaches to the blockchain technology for managing financial flows between enterprises, and between the state and enterprises. The entry of Ukraine into the global information space and the introduction of cryptocurrency in the domestic financial market will expand the investment market and provide targeted budgetary investments to national producers. They, in turn, can increase production through final product, services, net exports or the creation of products that replace imported ones. Three important functions of the blockchain technology-based financial services sector have been proposed: registration of transactions in an enterprise, identity verification (legal address), and contracting. The principles of state policy in the field of financial institutions in the cryptocurrency market are considered. Operations on the cryptocurrency market carried out by their participants at their own risk are described. The article discusses state guarantees for the observance and protection of property and other rights and legal interests of professional participants of the cryptocurrency market and other persons engaged in mining or operations with cryptocurrency, conditions of free competition in the provision of financial services in the cryptocurrency market.

AB In the past few years block chain has gained lot of popularity because blockchain is the core technology of bitcoin. Its utilization cases are growing in number of fields such as security of Internet of Things (IoT), banking sector, industries and medical centres. Moreover, IoT has expanded its acceptance because of its deployment in smart homes and city developments round the world. Unfortunately, IoT network devices operate on limited computing power with low storage capacity and network bandwidth. Thus, they are extra close to attacks than other end-point devices such as cell phones, tablets, or PCs. This paper focus on addressing significant security issues of IoT and maps IoT security issues in contradiction of existing solutions found in the literature. Moreover issues that are not solved after implementation of blockchain are highlighted.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) supports a wide range of applications including smart cities, traffic congestion, waste management, structural health, security, emergency services, logistics, retails, industrial control, and health care. IoT is mega-technology that can establish connection with anything, anyone, at any time, place, service on a platform and any network. It has a great impact on the whole block chain of businesses, smart objects and devices, systems and services that are enabled by heterogeneous network connectivity and is developed as a smart pervasive framework of smart devices. IoT devices are in use in many fields, they connect to complex devices, interface with hostile environments and are deployed on various uncontrolled platforms, therefore faces many security issues and challenges. Since the IoT offers a potential platform for integrating any type of network and complex system it could encounter vulnerabilities inherent to the individual systems which are available within the integrated network. This research paper is a study of the security issues of the individual systems responsible for IoT interconnection and their impact towards the integrated IoT system.

AB With the recent boom in the cryptocurrency market, hackers have been on the lookout to find novel ways of commandeering users' machine for covert and stealthy mining operations. In an attempt to expose such under-the-hood practices, this paper explores the issue of browser cryptojacking, whereby miners are secretly deployed inside browser code without the knowledge of the user. To this end, we analyze the top 50k websites from Alexa and find a noticeable percentage of sites that are indulging in this exploitative exercise often using heavily obfuscated code. Furthermore, mining prevention plug-ins, such as NoMiner, fail to flag such cleverly concealed instances. Hence, we propose a machine learning solution based on hardware-assisted profiling of browser code in real-time. A fine-grained micro-architectural footprint allows us to classify mining applications with >99% accuracy and even flags them if the mining code has been heavily obfuscated or encrypted. We build our own browser extension and show that it outperforms other plug-ins. The proposed design has negligible overhead on the user's machine and works for all standard off-the-shelf CPUs.

AB Money, when viewed as a social construct, can be a powerful tool for organizing society and allocating finite resources. However, existing monetary systems are highly centralized and this centralization has caused many crises in recent times. We therefore propose a token-based economic system that is self-regulating, can adjust the quantity of tokens to provide liquidity as needed, and avoids moral hazards. An early version of this system has been implemented on a blockchain platform as the Sora decentralized autonomous economy (DAE). Through allocating votes in a Sybil-resistant way, the Sora DAE democratically allocates new purchasing power according to open referendums. A dual-token system allows both stability of value for payments and creation of tokens for economic growth.

AB As scaling of CMOS slows down, there is growing interest in alternative technologies that can improve performance and energy-efficiency. Superconducting circuits based on Josephson Junctions (JJ) is an emerging technology that provides devices which can be switched with pico-second latencies and consumes two orders of magnitude lower switching energy compared to CMOS. While JJ-based circuits can operate at high frequencies and are energy-efficient, the technology faces three critical challenges: limited device density and lack of area-efficient technology for memory structures, low gate fanout, and new failure modes of Flux-Traps that occurs due to the operating environment.
   Limited memory density restricts the use of superconducting technology in the near term to application domains that have high compute intensity but require negligible amount of memory. In this paper, we study the use of superconducting technology to build an accelerator for SHA-256 engines commonly used in Bitcoin mining. We show that merely porting existing CMOS-based accelerator to superconducting technology provides 10.6X improvement in energy efficiency. Redesigning the accelerator to suit the unique constraints of superconducting technology (such as low fanout) improves the energy efficiency to 12.2X. We also investigate solutions to make the accelerator tolerant of new fault modes and show how this faulttolerant design can be leveraged to reduce the operating current, thereby improving the overall energy-efficiency to 46X.

AB Due to emerging disruptive technologies, Internet of Things (IoT) play a vital role for smart living domains, for examples, elderly and disabilities healthcare services and home safety and security monitoring and automation control services. These systems will send automatically an emergency call with home user information and location as a privacy data to public services like hospitals, police offices, or fire departments. This paper introduces emergency service for a Smart Home System (SHS) based on Ethereum blockchain with smart contract for decentralized handling access control among untrusted public services so called Home Service Providers (HSPs) and smart home IoT devices. Our SHS testbed consists of (1) smart home sensor manger equipped with Raspberry Pi (RPi) represented as an edge IoT gateway for gathering environmental sensor data, (2) HSP miners deployed Meteor and Ethereum platform, and (3) web-based applications for home users and HSP staffs. Furthermore, our contribution includes the integration of digital signature for the IoT device authentication, the One Time Passcode with QR code for HSP staff access control, and IPFS for manipulating emergency call from SHS in peers. Our implementation results focusing on HSP miners will be presented and analysed.

TI Food Safety Supervision System Based on Hierarchical Multi-Domain

SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The traditional food supervision system has problems such as lack of industry chain and data fragmentation, which has caused the phenomenon of field regulation to be uncomprehensive in the existing regulatory system and the disposal of response lag. Combining the characteristics of blockchain such as distribution, transparent, and collegiality with the actual needs of regional autonomy, we propose the hierarchical multi-domain blockchain (HMDBC) network structure and the secondary-check mechanism, which can support timely correction and replacement of the malicious supervision nodes by regional nodes co-governance, auxiliary verification of supervision nodes, and arbitration of superior regions. In order to optimize the supervision nodes election, we proposed fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model of credibility, which can be used to objectively and fairly evaluate the comprehensive reputation of each node in that region by considering various influencing factors of node performance indicators. Furthermore, we designed the data block structure model, which can support the supervisor node replacement. Our system can perform automatic food quality detection and warning of substandard food in the entire industrial chain, with the use of smart contracts combined with the food industry standards. Finally, comparing the complexity of the traditional blockchain system with PBFT consortium, our system is more secure, with lower broadcast complexity.

AB This article is part of a series of articles that describe an Integrated Decision Making Platform modeled after the human anatomy. In the first articles we presented the main components of the platform and the way they integrate with each other to form a cohesive and heterogeneous system. A resources is a quantifiable source of value and represents the scope or object of any decision making process. The allocation, management and distribution of resources is the main reason why a good decision making process becomes the essential factor that determines the success of any person, corporation, institution or state. The difference between success and failure is given by the way we decide to spend our resources. For this reason one vital component for a good decision making platform or system is the resource management component. The resource management and logistics component we will describe uses the blockchain as a robust, transparent and distributed ledger. The blockchain will not only allow us to keep track of our resources but using stored blockchain procedures, popularly called smart contracts, we can create the logistics for how we add, allocate, distribute and spend our resources

AB Many cryptocurrency wallet applications on desktop provide an open remote procedure call (RPC) interface that other blockchain-based applications can use to access their functionality. This paper studies the security of the RPC interface in several cryptocurrency wallets. We find that, in many cases, a malicious process running on the computer regardless of its privileges can impersonate the communication endpoints of the RPC channel and, effectively, steal the funds in the wallet. The attacks are closely related to server and client impersonation on computer networks but occur inside the computer. The malicious process may be created by another authenticated but unprivileged user on the same computer or even by the guest user. The main contribution of this paper is to raise awareness among wallet developers about the need to protect local RPC channels with the same prudence as network connections. We also hope that it will discourage users to run security-critical applications like cryptocurrency wallets on shared systems or computers with guest account enabled.

TI Blockchain-Based Access Control Model to Preserve Privacy for Personal
   Health Record Systems
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Personal health record system (PHR system) stores health-related information of an individual. PHR system allows the data owner to manage and share his/her data with selected individuals. The originality or tamper resistance feature is crucial for PHR system because of the irreversible consequence of incorrect information. Blockchain technology becomes a potential solution due to its immutability and irreversibility properties. Unfortunately, some technical impediments such as limited storage, privacy concern, consent irrevocability, inefficient performance, and energy consumption exist. This work aims to handle these blockchain drawbacks and propose a blockchain-based PHR model. The proposed model is built using the blockchain technology to support a tamper resistance feature. Proxy reencryption and other cryptographic techniques are employed to preserve privacy. Features of the proposed model include fine-grained and flexible access control, revocability of consent, auditability, and tamper resistance. A detailed security analysis shows that the proposed model is provably secure for privacy and tamper resistance. The performance analysis shows that the proposed model achieves a better overall performance compared with the existing approach in the literature. Thus the proposed model is more suitable for the PHR system usage.

AB Business processes in companies lead to an enormous number of event logs in their IT systems. Evaluating these event logs using data mining can provide companies with valuable process analysis information which can uncover process improvement potentials. However, media breaks frequently occur in these processes, so that there is a risk of optimizing isolated subprocesses only. Blockchain technology may avoid these media breaks and thus create the basis for complete event log analysis. The focus of our paper is to investigate existing requirements and to identify a blockchain based solution scenario evaluated by experts.

AB Since appearance of www protocol in 1991, the trend in different aspects of e-commerce is diminishing the role of mediators. "Disintermediation" become the keyword defining many e-commerce technologies. Bitcoin, the original application motivated development of Blockchain technology, aimed removing banks as the mediators and trusted third party in financial transactions. But the scope of this underlying technology is much broader than purely the word of cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology offers new paradigm of connectivity, information exchange and information use, exploring decentralized, distributed data processing, and encrypting via public and private keys.
   Blockchain was launched as the underlying technology in introducing bitcoins. Research conducted on the dynamics of publications addressing Blockchain, shows that this technology deserted recently from purely bitcoin / crypto-currencies application domain. The intensity of publication addressing applications of this technology demonstrated its relevance to different business domains, mostly Internet of Things (IoT), but also sectors as Energy, Healthcare, and Finance, mostly related to retailed services.
   Consideration of Blockchain technology from this broader perspective, justify the needs of introducing it to students in fields like Computer Science, Information Systems, and Information Technology, but it is especially valuable for programs training Data Science competences.
   The paper shares experience of introducing Blockchain technology, which is still in its infantry stage according to maturity life cycle, in Data Science Master Program. Resolving problems like lack of sufficient well-developed training materials, lack of competent trainers, and lack of adequate equipment to experiment are among the overcome major barriers.
   Dynamics of innovations in area of information technologies and shortening the life cycle from discovery to wide distribution forces education institutions, traditionally conservative in adopting innovation, to develop experience in fast adjustment of their curriculum to react to the emerging challenges. The case of incorporated Blockchain related content into curriculum is discussed as a possible practice.

AB Blockchain technologies and smart contracts are becoming mainstream research fields in computer science and researchers are continuously investigating new frontiers for new applications. Likewise, microservices are getting more and more popular in the latest years thanks to their properties, that allow teams to slice existing information systems into small and independent services that can be developed independently by different teams.
   A symmetric paradigm applies to smart contracts as well, which represent well defined, usually isolated, executable programs, typically implementing simple and autonomous tasks with a well defined purpose, which can be assumed as services provided by the Contract. In this work we analyze a concrete case study where the microservices architecture environment is replicated and implemented through an equivalent set of smart contracts, showing for the first time the feasibility of implementing a microservices-based system with smart contracts and how the two innovative paradigms match together.
   Results show that it is possible to implement a simple microservices-based system with smart contracts maintaining the same set of functionalities and results. The result could be highly beneficial in contexts such as smart voting, where not only the data integrity is fundamental but also the source code executed must be trustable.

AB Internet of Things (IoT), an significant support for strategic emerging industries, is re-building industrial systems, such as transportation, healthcare and energy, while a number of new features and requirements like data cross-industry sharding appear in recent years. The emerging Blockchain technology has provided a promising opportunity to break information island and single-domain management in multi-domain IoT systems by leveraging distributed storage. On the other hand, the transaction consensus throughput in the mainstream blockchain systems, such as Ethereum and Fabric, is far from meeting the demand for massive data storage in time in multi-domain IoT systems. In this paper, we design a sharding protocol called MDIoTSP. The protocol first partitions the overall blockchains into many small shards, each of which generally recognized as a micro-blockchain according to the multiple domains, and then make the final consensus by merging the hash digests of the sub-blocks which generated from the shards for the multi-domain IoT blockchains ecosystem specifically. We also develop MicrothingsChains to run MDIoTSP in multi-domain IoT blockchains to prove our assumption that MDIoTSP scales up the transaction consensus throughput near linearly with the number of shards.

TI A Novel Methodology for HYIP Operators' Bitcoin Addresses Identification
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bitcoin is one of the most popular decentralized cryptocurrencies to date. However, it has been widely reported that it can be used for investment scams, which are referred to as high yield investment programs (HYIP). Although from the security forensic point of view it is very important to identify the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, so far in the open technical literature no systematic method which reliably collects and identifies such Bitcoin addresses has been proposed. In this paper, a novel methodology is introduced, which efficiently collects a large number of the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses and identifies them based upon a novel analysis of their transactions history. In particular, a scraping-based method is first proposed which is able to collect more than 2,000 HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses from the Internet thus providing a large number of the HYIPs' samples. Second, a supervised machine learning technique, which classifies, whether or not, specific Bitcoin addresses belong to the HYIP operators, is introduced and its performance is evaluated. The proposed classification method is based upon two novel approaches, namely the rate conversion technique that mitigates the effect of Bitcoin price volatility and the sampling technique that reduces the computational amount without sacrificing the classification performance. By employing close to 30,000 real Bitcoin addresses, extensive performance evaluation results obtained by means of computer simulation experiments have shown that the proposed methodology achieves excellent performance, i.e., 95% of the HYIP addresses can be correctly classified, while maintaining a false positive rate less than 4.9%. In order to further validate the proposed classifier's ability to detect the HYIP operators' Bitcoin addresses, our designed classifier has been tested against a recently published list of the HYIP addresses maintaining its excellent detection accuracy by achieving a 93.75% success rate.

SO TEKNOKULTURA: REVISTA DE CULTURA DIGITAL Y MOVIMIENTOS SOCIALES
AB Creating fair, transparent and genuinely democratic modes of decentralized decision-making has been a key concern for many developers and users of blockchains. This article evaluates several popular methods of maintaining consensus and achieving decentralized decision-making on blockchain networks in order to assess the extent to which blockchains challenge the norms of the liberal-democratic order. In particular, it compares and contrasts Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanisms, assessing not just how they operate in a technical sense but also (and most important) the political, economic and social dimensions of these different blockchain governance strategies. This comparison highlights efforts by blockchain communities to redefine or push the bounds of democracy, as well as the challenges they have faced in their efforts to create digital democracies that do not reproduce the same economic and social inequalities present in traditional democratic systems.

AB This paper presents a new Beagle framework for Smart Contracts (SCs) taking account of law. Different from previous SC development or execution frameworks, this framework takes a practical approach to integrate law into SCs. Instead of translating legal contracts into codes directly, this paper proposes to treat SCs as a key component of legal contracts, use SCs to partially automate the executions of legal contracts, and produce legal evidence during the process. Thus, the proposed SC design will be significantly different from previous SC designs, not in programming languages to be used, but in the way SCs are designed and executed. This Beagle framework has five stages: SC template development from domain analysis, formal SC model and code development from templates, verification and validation (V&V), SC execution, and runtime monitoring.

TI Blockchain-Driven IoT for Food Traceability With an Integrated Consensus
   Mechanism
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Food traceability has been one of the emerging blockchain applications in recent years, for improving the areas of anti-counterfeiting and quality assurance. Existing food traceability systems do not guarantee a high level of system reliability, scalability, and information accuracy. Moreover, the traceability process is time-consuming and complicated in modern supply chain networks. To alleviate these concerns, blockchain technology is promising to create a new ontology for supply chain traceability. However, most consensus mechanisms and data flow in blockchain are developed for cryptocurrency, not for supply chain traceability; hence, simply applying blockchain technology to food traceability is impractical. In this paper, a blockchain-IoT-based food traceability system (BIFTS) is proposed to integrate the novel deployment of blockchain, IoT technology, and fuzzy logic into a total traceability shelf life management system for managing perishable food. To address the needs for food traceability, lightweight and vaporized characteristics are deployed in the blockchain, while an integrated consensus mechanism that considers shipment transit time, stakeholder assessment, and shipment volume is developed. The data flow of blockchain is then aligned to the deployment of IoT technologies according to the level of traceable resource units. Subsequently, the decision support can be established in the food supply chain by using reliable and accurate data for shelf life adjustment, and by using fuzzy logic for quality decay evaluation.

AB Conventional data storage methods like SQL and NoSQL offer a huge amount of possibilities with one major disadvantage, having to use a centralized authority. This authority may be in the form of a centralized or decentralized master server or a permissioned peer-to-peer setting. This paper looks at different technologies on how to persist data without using a central authority, mainly looking at permissionless peer-to-peer networks, primarily Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and a combination of DLTs with conventional databases. Afterwards it is shown how a system like this might be implemented in two prototypes which are then evaluated against conventional databases.

AB It is difficult to overstate how large a role Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technology has played in advancing safety, mobility, and productivity in our daily lives. ITS encompasses a broad range of technologies, including information and communication technologies, transportation and communication infrastructures, connected vehicles, and emerging technologies such as Internet-of-Things (IoT). It has been studied extensively in many different disciplines, including transportation, communication, database and management communities. Unfortunately, there are still many unsolved challenges that hinder the large deployment of advanced ITS systems. Recent studies have proposed using Blockchain, an emerging technology that enables decentralized coordination, to address inherent challenges in ITS such as security and scalability. However, these studies did not address a key question: how can we achieve a sustainable ITS ecosystem? This paper presents our preliminary study where we first point out the limitations of prior Blockchain-based ITS systems and then outline an architecture to support a sustainable ITS ecosystem. Our main goal is to stimulate further effort and cross-disciplinary collaboration by providing guidance and reference for future studies.

Methodology: In course of article the authors employed general scientific and comparative-law methods as well as the method of legal forecasting. Results: The article deals with the issue to determine, enshrine and regulate smart contracts in modern legislation of the Russian Federation and of some foreign countries. Special attention is paid to ambivalent approaches to the definition of smart contracts: as a computer code and as a civil-law contract. The authors study the current foreign legislation on the regulation of smart contracts as well as the most recent edition of the Bill Draft "On Digital Financial Assets" in the Russian Federation. Potential applications of the blockchain technology and smart contracts are considered particularly. Conclusion/recommendations: The authors prove a conclusion on the need for additional legal regulation of smart contracts, especially in terms of regulating the definition and interpretation hereof. They believe that any smart contract should be considered as a new form of civil-law contract, but not as a computer code.

AB Technology is seen as an enabler for gaining new capabilities in universities. Nowadays, higher education institutions have seen how technology enhances the competitive advantage for not only the business environment but as well for their teachers and students. Innovation is mainstream and is creating opportunities to access and learn technologies that were not possible before. Universities should no longer be behind technology compared with other sectors. Although this is not yet explored, new technologies that as next-generation security, the blockchain, cloud, AI conversational interface, and digital credentials can be leverage from different industries. Innovative thinking on the basis of which institutions collaborate with various suppliers, distributors and customers to generate unique value easily replaces the traditional thinking that considers innovation as a property and marketing activity as a static show in one direction. Personalization is the key to offering quality services, and this is what disruptive technologies are offering. Universities have to focus on technologies that are appropriate for their strategy but at the same time to align with key market trends. Students are being more informed and empowered by personal devices that help and assist them in fulfilling their tasks and goals. Anticipating and meeting their needs and expectations suppose automating process and increasing digitization offering in universities. People and things are exchanging data at every moment. The barrier between the digital world and the physical world is crumbling which implies that higher education institutes need to be aligned with them for attracting and retaining students. The most significant technological opportunity for today's institution is to reduce total spend by targeted IT investments that are converted from fixed capital models to a variable cost operating models. Collaboration and co-creation are increasingly crucial for creating value for students and teachers."value" (including the age-old issue of cost optimization) but also higher levels of customer experience.

AB The present paper deals with the problem of comprehension within the framework of digital communication. The digital communications functioning within the framework of the post-information society are characterized by interactivity, unlimited capacity, the exchange of communicants' roles and only a conditional possibility for determining directions, values and possible consequences of communication.
   The authors come to a conclusion that new technologies (blockchain, AI, Big data) contribute to implementation of efficient communicative strategies, in which each communicant takes into account the social and personal characteristics of communication participants. The choice of discursive strategies should be based on the possibility of forming multiple identities of all communication participants. But achieving full understanding between the communication participants is difficult due to the impossibility of merging the communicating " Ego" and " the Other".

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors have become cheaper and more ubiquitous than ever [1]. From smart thermometers to home assistants and smartphones, massive amounts of data are being streamed in real-time by sensors that are continuously connected to the web. However, these data tend to be amassed in private silos that are difficult to access. Many private companies and public institutions could build valuable services with these data but so far few solutions have been proposed on how to bridge this gap. In this paper we introduce Hermes, a platform for trading sensor data using distributed ledgers as intermediaries to add safeguards against malicious behavior.

In this article, we advance a Blockchain based decentralized architecture for the storage of IoT data produced from smart home/cities. The architecture includes a secure communication protocol using a sign-encryption technique between power constrained IoT devices and a Gateway. The sign encryption also preserves privacy. We propose that a Software Agent executing on the Gateway selects a Miner node using performance parameters of Miners. Simulations demonstrate that the recommended Miner selection outperforms Proof of Works selection used in Bitcoin and Random Miner Selection.

AB Nowadays, the automobile industry is integrating many new features into vehicles. To provide these features, various electronic systems are being added. These systems are coordinated by different ECUs (Electronic Control Unit). Vehicle ECUs are internally connected through multiple communication buses. Any ECU connected to the bus can read or send data to other ECUs. As a result, if an adversary can compromise one of the ECUs, then the adversary will be able to access and exploit the data of other important ECUs. Moreover, an adversary can modify the stored data of an important ECU, if it is compromised. To solve these problems, we propose the use of symmetric key cryptography and elliptic curve-based Public Key Encryption (PKE) for ensuring confidentiality and the use of digital signature for ensuring integrity and authenticity. In addition, we propose the adoption of an identity-based access control to control the communication permissions. We also introduce a Blockchain-inspired mechanism to secure data stored in ECUs. Finally, we integrate a watcher to monitor the stored data and report if it is modified. We implement our concept using the ARM architecture-based Raspberry Pi Board and show that our approach can improve security in ECU communications and the watcher reports when an ECU data is modified.

When electronics devices are delivered through non trusted supply chains, there is a risk of malware injection. Bare metal architecture defeats these threats, but raises the issue of programmer integrity insurance. We propose to use innovative integrity probe software whose goal is to detect malicious bootloader thanks to which they are downloaded in the programmer memory.

AB Lyra2REv2 is a hashing algorithm that consists of a chain of individual hashing algorithms and it is used as a proof-of-work function in several cryptocurrencies that aim to be ASIC-resistant. The most crucial hashing algorithm in the Lyra2REv2 chain is a specific instance of the general Lyra2 algorithm. In this work we present the first FPGA implementation of the aforementioned instance of Lyra2 and we explain how several properties of the algorithm can be exploited in order to optimize the design.

AB Smart contracts are applications that are deployed and executed on a blockchain's decentralised infrastructure. Many smart contract applications rely on data that resides outside the blockchain. However, while traditional web applications can communicate with trustworthy data sources directly through the Internet, this is not possible for smart contracts because their execution must be deterministic. Bringing external data into the blockchain has been a topic of research since the first introduction of Ethereum. A system that can provide this data to smart contracts is called an oracle. The primary requirement in designing oracles is that the authenticity of the data must be publicly verifiable, which can be achieved through signatures. However, transmitting data to the blockchain and performing the verification is costly, especially if applications require data from multiple sources. In that case, current approaches would need to retrieve the data from each source separately. In this paper, we present the concept of MUlti-Source oraCLE (MUSCLE) for retrieving data from multiple sources, which we believe to be the first to focus on the multi-source scenario. We implement five variants of MUSCLE, each using a different signature or aggregate signature scheme and compare their performance with two oracles that are based on TLS-N, which represents the current state of the art. Our results show that the ECDSA-based MUSCLE features the lowest total gas expenditure, while the BGLS-based oracle provides lower transaction and storage costs.

AB This paper investigates the specification and verification of atomic swap multi-party transactions. It is argued that logics with the ability to express properties of strategies of players in a multi-agent setting are conceptually useful for this purpose, although ultimately, the less expressive setting of temporal logic suffices for verification of concrete implementations. This is illustrated through the use of a model checker to verify atomic swap smart contracts in on-chain and cross-chain settings.

AB Organizations nowadays are largely computerized, with a mixture of internal and external services providing them with on-demand functionality. In some situations (e.g. emergency situations), cross-organizational collaboration is needed, providing external users access to internal services. Trust between partners in such a collaboration can however be an issue. Although (federated) access control policies may be in place, it is unclear which data was requested and delivered after a collaboration has finished. This may lead to disputes between participating organizations. The open-source permissioned blockchain Hyperledger Fabric is utilized to create a logging mechanism for the actions performed by the participants in such a collaboration. This paper presents the architecture needed for such a logging mechanism and provides details on its operation. A prototype was designed in order to evaluate the performance of an asynchronous logging approach. Measurements show that the proposed logging mechanism enables organizations to create a log of service interactions with limited delay imposed on the data exchange process.

AB Nowadays, the authenticating procedure for transactions is still complicated, and the current Value-Added Tax (VAT) administration system works as centralized server, which consists of high-risk attacks from hackers. Therefore, only a few countries use digital technologies to calculate and manage the VAT payment despite of their benefits. In this paper, by combining decentralized storage network (DSN) with the smart contract (SC), we propose a new model based on Blockchain technology to authenticate the transaction, calculate Value-Added Tax and approve VAT payment. This system runs in a host computer (host PC) for encrypting and decrypting data. The smart contract is implemented in Remix Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the Ethereum platform. Experiential results show that the new model not only saves the cost for authenticating transactions but also protects the data from hacker's attacks due to consensus property of the Blockchain technology.

TI Towards a commodity theory of token money: on 'Gold standard thinking in
   a fiat currency world'
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB Via a discussion of public debates surrounding the potential minting of a trillion dollar platinum coin in the context of the American debt ceiling crises of 2011 and 2013, this essay seeks to make sense of the popular persistence of 'commodity' or 'metallist' understandings of money's value in the face of a scholarly consensus that all currency is 'token' or 'fiat' in nature. Scholars from Knapp to Desan have elaborated token theories of commodity money, wherein both precious and non-precious currencies are treated as the products of social construction. By contrast, I suggest the need to supplement such approaches with what I term a commodity theory of token money, wherein money objects made from both precious and non-precious materials are treated as inherently valuable. Exploring the semiotic convergence between gold, Bitcoin and modern paper money, I suggest that the broadly Peircean notion of rhematization in which symbol and indexical signs are (mis)taken for iconic ones is particularly suited to unpack the continuing social salience of commodity theories of money across the gold/paper divide. Moreover attention must be paid to how we define the icon itself.

TI Perceptions on self-regulation and transaction friendliness relevant to
   smart contracting
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND MANAGEMENT
AB Purpose This paper aims to report on signs of public awareness and empowerment among the general public that are presumed to determine the viability of the smart contracting (SC) approach and identifies prevailing concerns regarding individual transactional experiences.
   Design/methodology/approach A mixed approach was followed to explore perceptions of self-regulation and transaction friendliness by using an interpretative multiple case study method and by presenting a descriptive summative analysis of the data.
   Findings On self-regulation, the study reveals spread awareness, empowerment, contractual competences and responsibility. Regarding transaction friendliness, subject matter influences transaction experiences the most, and trust and engagement are the most problematic factors. The findings support the viability of SC, endorsing the application of proactive perspectives in legal and managerial practice.
   Research limitations/implications The study confirms the foundational assumptions of SC, identifies key transactional issues that should be further addressed to improve the functionality of digital trade environments and contributes to the consolidation of the legal design research field on transaction usability.
   Practical implications The findings point to the viability of SC. Organizations and practitioners are given indications on transaction upgrade priorities and invited to adopt and help disseminate the proposal.
   Social implications The expansion of a collaborative transactional culture can reduce legal disputes, improving the legal environment of business and strengthening private governance regulatory models.
   Originality/value This is the first empirical study on the viability conditions of the SC-approach, identifying transactional usability testing and intervention priorities.

TI A Decentralized Context Broker Using Byzantine Fault Tolerant Consensus
SO LEDGER
AB A context broker is a reliable message-relaying service used to connect devices by integrating all device protocols and communication methods, and reliably transporting messages while isolating data from other application service layers and networking complexities. A highly scalable decentralized context broker stack is composed of three layers-starting with a peer-to-peer network connecting a byzantine fault-tolerant (i.e., blockchain-based) consensus protocol-and it manages the communication using a web-socket streaming protocol as interface to other applications. This paper presents such a concept for a decentralized context broker stack for intercommunication between heterogeneous materials handling systems, and deploys the stack as proof-of-concept using ROS-based robots in a logistics scenario.

TI Big data security challenges and strategies
SO AIMS MATHEMATICS
AB Big data, a recently popular term that refers to a massive collection of very large and complex data sets, is facing serious security and privacy challenges. Due to the typical characteristics of big data, namely velocity, volume and variety associated with large-scale cloud infrastructures and the Internet of Things (IoT), traditional security and privacy mechanisms are inadequate and unable to cope with the rapid data explosion in such a complex distributed computing environment. With big data analytics being widely used by businesses and government for decision making, security risk mitigation plays an important role in big data infrastructures worldwide. Traditional security mechanisms have failed to cope with the scalability, interoperability and adaptability of contemporary technologies that are required for big data. This paper takes an exploratory initial step using first principles to address this gap in literature. Firstly, we establish the current trends in big data comprehensively by identifying eleven Vs as important dimensions of big data, which form the contributing factors having an impact on the impending security problem. Next, we map the eleven Vs to the three phases of big data life cycle in order to unearth the major security and privacy challenges of big data. Finally, the paper provides four practical strategies adapted from contemporary technologies such as data provenance, encryption and access control, data mining and blockchain, identifying their associated real implementation examples. This work would pave way for future research investigations in this important big data security arena.

TI A Short Server-Aided Certificateless Aggregate Multisignature Scheme in
   the Standard Model
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Aggregate signature scheme allows each signer to sign a different message and then all those signatures are aggregated into a single short signature. In contrast, multisignature scheme allows multisigners to jointly sign only one message. Aggregate multisignature scheme is a combination of both aforementioned signature schemes, where signers can choose to generate either a multisignature or an aggregate signature. This combination scheme has many concrete application scenarios such as Bitcoin blockchain, Healthcare, Multicast Acknowledgment Aggregation, and so on. On the other hand, to deal with the problems of expensive certificates in certified public key cryptography and key escrow in identity-based cryptography, the notion of certificateless public key cryptography has been introduced by Riyami and Paterson at Asiacrypt'03. In this paper, we propose the first certificateless aggregate multisignature scheme that achieves the constant-size of signature and is secure in the standard model under a generalization of the Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. In our scheme, however, the signature is generated with the help of the authority.

AB Throughput is a key property for any distributed ledger technology. However, limited resources, such as bandwidth or node computational power, can lead to network congestion when nodes try to issue more transactions than the network can handle. Consequently, priority criteria are necessary to determine whether a transaction should be accepted or not. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive rate control algorithm for the Tangle, a new-generation distributed ledger allowing large throughput. Our approach combines various concepts, such as resource tests and Proof-of-Work with dynamic difficulty. Our algorithm not only serves as an anti-spam mechanism, but also achieves fair representation. This is to be contrasted with pure Proof-of-Work blockchains, which lead to wasteful mining races.

AB This work develops a principled approach for coordinating decentralized systems that can exchange information, issue and service requests, and perform outcome-focused actions together. It harnesses the resiliency and robustness offered by blockchain frameworks to enable sustained activity in the presence a diverse set of failure modes, operating constraints, and changing task requirements. We accomplish this through the Tactical Distributed Ledger, a distributed computer that can accommodate a wide range of sensors, agents, vehicles, and devices to create a decentralized system. We have used this framework to deploy a multi-participant system that combines sensing, vehicle mobility, and situational awareness to perform coordinated activities in a simulated city environment. The key mechanism that enables this interaction is a robust auction framework implemented on top of a smart contract blockchain system. This paper details the design, components, and features of the auction system.

AB Is a blockchain revolution happening now or has its hype been seriously overstated? In the data-driven world, blockchain technology can potentially bring many benefits to people and organisations that suffer from a lack of information infrastructure or access to reliable integrated data. So, there is no surprise that leading actors of global environmental governance, including the United Nations and the World Bank, have started to support initiatives to develop blockchain platforms. However, the successful implementation of this technology and its ability to contribute to effective environmental policies depend on a range of factors that are often difficult to manage. In this paper, we aim to systematise theoretical and practical approaches to blockchain platforms in environmental management as well as to analyse existing barriers to this adoption. Based on our study, we concluded that the main obstacles preventing a blockchain revolution in global environmental governance are not connected to technological development, but rather to modern information cultures and worldviews.

The methods of qualitative, quantitative, and correlation analysis, graphical modelling, causality tests, comparisons and generalizations were used. Results. The essence of the institutional environment of the state financial control is determined and its contradictions are revealed. It is established that in order to overcome the contradictions of the institutional environment of state financial control, it is necessary to resolve the issue of intensifying its digitalization since the use of financial technologies affects the state of governance. Directions of the digitization of the institutional environment of the state financial control were examined through the prism of relations "control-state", "control-enterprise", "controlsociety", and "control-European Community", with the justification of proposals that should be implemented in the context of isolated components. Practical importance. The digitalization of the institutional environment of state financial control should be based on electronic democracy, parameterization of annual reports of controlling bodies, blockchain interoperability, automation of control measures, use of artificial intelligence and cloud computing technologies, services based on open data, interactive methods of information sharing (social networks, television programs, and video blogs), and electronic tax fraud identification services in international trade. Value/originality. The level of digitalization of the external institutional environment of the state financial control is higher than the level of digitalization of the internal environment. This creates the basis for the development of the theory of state financial control, as well as the practice of its implementation, which requires appropriate innovative and technological transformations.

AB Blockchain systems promise to mediate interactions of mutually distrusting parties without a trusted third party. However, protocols with full smart contract-based security are either limited in functionality or complex, with high costs for secured interactions. This observation leads to the development of protocol-specific schemes to avoid costly dispute resolution in case all participants remain honest. In this paper, we introduce SmartJudge, an extensible generalization of this trend for smart contract-based two-party protocols. SmartJudge relies on a protocol-independent mediator smart contract that moderates two-party interactions and only consults protocol-specific verifier smart contracts in case of a dispute. This way, SmartJudge avoids verification costs in absence of disputes and sustains interaction confidentiality among honest parties. We implement verifier smart contracts for cross-blockchain trades and exchanging digital goods and show that SmartJudge can reduce costs by 46-50% and 22% over current state of the art, respectively.

TI Securing Data With Blockchain and AI
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Data is the input for various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to mine valuable features, yet data in Internet is scattered everywhere and controlled by different stakeholders who cannot believe in each other, and usage of the data in complex cyberspace is difficult to authorize or to validate. As a result, it is very difficult to enable data sharing in cyberspace for the real big data, as well as a real powerful AI. In this paper, we propose the SecNet, an architecture that can enable secure data storing, computing, and sharing in the large-scale Internet environment, aiming at a more secure cyberspace with real big data and thus enhanced AI with plenty of data source, by integrating three key components: 1) blockchain-based data sharing with ownership guarantee, which enables trusted data sharing in the large-scale environment to form real big data; 2) AI-based secure computing platform to produce more intelligent security rules, which helps to construct a more trusted cyberspace; 3) trusted value-exchange mechanism for purchasing security service, providing a way for participants to gain economic rewards when giving out their data or service, which promotes the data sharing and thus achieves better performance of AI. Moreover, we discuss the typical use scenario of SecNet as well as its potentially alternative way to deploy, as well as analyze its effectiveness from the aspect of network security and economic revenue.

AB With the widespread of Bitcoin, blockchain has been focused by researchers from many fields, such as digital cryptocurrencies, finance security exchange, decentralized trade platform and so on. However, the operation efficiency (about 10min/per block) has limited its practical application except of Bitcoin. In this paper, we conduct further research based on the existing hybrid blockchain architectures, say N + X Hybrid Blockchain, which may significantly improve blockchain efficiency with the negligible cost of security. Moreover, we gave an evaluation model for the feedback process of nodes in the N+X Hybrid Blockchain and obtained optimal strategies. For the application of Energy Internet (EI), we proposed a scheduling mechanism based on the above evaluation model, and given an algorithm to implement it.

TI Blockchain-Based Personal Health Records Sharing Scheme With Data
   Integrity Verifiable
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The sharing of personal health records can help to improve the accuracy of the doctor's diagnosis and to promote the progress of medical research. Currently, to reduce the maintenance cost of data, personal health records are usually outsourced to a third party such as the cloud service provider. In this case, patients may lose direct control over their personal health records and the semi-trusted cloud service provider may tamper with or reveal personal health records. Therefore, ensuring the privacy and integrity of personal health records and realizing the fine-grained access control are crucial issues when personal health records are shared. As a distributed architecture with decentralized and tamper-proof features, blockchain provides a new way to protect the personal health records sharing system. In this paper, we propose a new personal health records sharing scheme with data integrity verifiable based on blockchain. Aiming at the problems of privacy disclosure, limited keyword search ability and loss of control rights in the process of personal health record sharing, the new scheme uses searchable symmetric encryption and attribute-based encryption techniques to achieve privacy protection, keyword search, and fine-grained access control. Compared with the existing similar schemes, the new scheme allows patients to distribute attribute private key for users, avoiding many security problems caused by the existing of attribute authority in the scheme. Furthermore, the new scheme uses blockchain to manage keys in the scheme, avoiding the single point failure problem of centralized key management. In particular, the new scheme stores the hash values of encrypted personal health records in blockchain, and the related index set is stored in smart contract, which can further improve the efficiency of data integrity verification. Finally, performance evaluation and security analysis indicate that our scheme is secure and feasible for practical use.

TI Auditable Protocols for Fair Payment and Physical Asset Delivery Based
   on Smart Contracts
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the rapid development of electronic information technology, online transaction will gradually surpass traditional market transaction, among which online payment and asset delivery become the focus of attention. But in fact, due to the incomplete third-party payment mechanism and the intrusion risk of various charging Trojan, it is easy to cause a trust crisis. The existing centralized framework often leads to information asymmetry between the two parties. Therefore, how to realize the fairness of payment and the auditability of assets in the distributed system is a challenging problem. The emerging blockchain technology provides a new method with its openness, transparency and verifiability. Existing researches do not provide a complete shopping model for consumers, most of which focuses on payments or only on asset delivery. In this paper, we propose an auditable fair payment and physical asset delivery protocol based on smart contracts. Three types of smart contracts are designed to achieve reliable and fair payment among merchants, consumers and logistics companies. The traceability and auditability of blockchain provide an effective method to audit assets and data sharing in the whole transportation. In view of the phenomenon of goods being switched, the way of "pre-verification" is added. In order to prevent the illegal elements to fake pickup code, induce consumers to conduct illegal operations, cause property loss, in our system the pickup codes are generated by consumers to reduce the risk of fraud. In addition, our plan designs a complete return process for the first time, providing better service experience and higher efficiency for consumers. Finally, all the contracts involved in the scheme are implemented and deployed on the ethereum test network. The results of security analysis and evaluation showed that our scheme was improved in cost, with high security and availability.

TI A Secure Cloud Storage Framework With Access Control Based on Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Now more and more data are being outsourced to cloud services. In order to ensure data security and privacy, data are usually stored on the cloud server in the form of ciphertext. When a user requests access to the encrypted data, an access key distributed by a third party is needed. However, if the third party is dishonest, the security of the system will be threatened. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new secure cloud storage framework with access control by using the Ethereum blockchain technology. Our new scheme is a combination of Ethereum blockchain and ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE). The proposed cloud storage framework is decentralized, that is, there is no trusted third party in the system. Our scheme has three main features. First, as the Ethereum blockchain technology is used, the data owner can store ciphertext of data through smart contracts in a blockchain network. Second, the data owner can set valid access periods for data usage so that the ciphertext can only be decrypted during valid access periods. Finally, as the creation and invocation of each smart contract can be stored in the blockchain, thus, the function of the trace is achieved. The analysis of the security and experiment shows that our scheme is feasible.

TI Smart Contract-Based Product Traceability System in the Supply Chain
   Scenario
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the improvement of living standard, people begin to pay more attention to food safety and product quality. Therefore, for consumers, it is necessary to establish a reliable system that can trace the source of products. However, most existing traceability systems tend to lack transparency, data is primarily stored within the enterprise, and the cost of tampering with data is very low. Besides, the supply chain nodes are easy to evade responsibility when product safety or quality issues arise under the traditional centralized management model, and it is difficult to trace the root of issues. The development of blockchain technology provides us with new ideas for realizing the traceability of products in supply chain scenarios. Due to its characteristics of decentralization, transparency, and immutability, blockchain can be effectively used to alleviate the above problems. In this paper, we propose a product traceability system based on blockchain technology, in which all product transferring histories are perpetually recorded in a distributed ledger by using smart contracts and a chain is formed that can trace back to the source of the products. In particular, we design an event response mechanism to verify the identities of both parties of the transaction, so that the validity of the transaction can be guaranteed. And all events are permanently stored in the form of logs as a basis for handling disputes and tracking responsible entities. Furthermore, a system prototype is constructed based on the testing framework of Truffle. The contract code is deployed on a test network TestRpc that runs in local memory, and a decentralized web page interface is implemented based on the prototype. Finally, the system security analysis and experimental results show that our solution is feasible.

TI EIDM: A Ethereum-Based Cloud User Identity Management Protocol
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In cloud system, user identity authentication is a key problem. If design defects persist in a cloud user identity authentication scheme, direct risks of sensitive data loss and severe information breach will be incurred. At present, the main problem of cloud user identity management system is that it relies too much on third-party services. Although some third-party-detachment schemes have been proposed in recent years, most of them still rely heavily on cloud server-centered design system. In this paper, a cloud user identity management protocol based on ethereum blockchain was proposed, followed by an establishment of a simple credit management system framework. The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers. The new protocol solves the problem of over-reliance on third parties in the existing identity management system solutions. In the end, an analysis on the security of the new protocol showed that the EIDM protocol proposed in this paper presents more diversified security guarantees relative to the CIDM protocol. The performance evaluation results also indicated that the new protocol demonstrates better practicability and flexibility.

TI Blockchain-Based Fair Payment Protocol for Deduplication Cloud Storage
   System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Today more and more enterprises and individuals are outsourcing their data to cloud storage system. Data deduplication is one of the important technologies to reduce the storage cost of cloud storage system. In a cloud storage system with deduplication technology, the client can outsource the data files to the cloud storage server and pay for them. Fair payment is one of key issues in the cloud deduplication storage system. At present, a variety of secure deduplication encryption schemes have been designed to protect the privacy of client data. However, most existing fair payment solutions use traditional electronic cash systems to generate payment tokens, which requires a trusted authority to prevent double-spending. Trusted authorities will become bottlenecks in the payment system. Faced with this problem, in this paper, we propose a new decentralized fair payment protocol for cloud deduplication storage system by utilizing ethereum blockchain technology. The new protocol takes advantage of the decentralization of blockchain technology, allowing direct transactions without the participation of trusted third parties. In the new protocol, if a malicious situation occurs, the system can guarantee fair payment by pre-storing penalty money in the smart contract. Safety analysis and experimental analysis show that our new protocol is feasible.

AB The great market success of Blockchain makes it an extremely valuable target for attackers. A well-known attack in Blockchain is the forking wrack, where divergent blockchains are produced for inserting some new features to facilitate security breaches. The state-of-the-art works mostly focus on how to detect attacks in real-time transactions, which is in hindsight and cannot deter the lOrking attack from the root. To take precautions, we employ the large deviation theory to study the vulnerability of blockchain networks incurred by intentional forks front a micro point of view, boosting forward-looking and strategic planning mechanisms for resisting the forking attack. Our study is fine-grained, because it offers not only the vulnerability probability of a blockchain network but also its decay speed, through which we find setting the parameter related to the robust level has more power than enhancing the computer power in speeding up the failure of attacks. This finding is valuable since it renders an opportunity to improve the robustness of a blockchain network in a cost-efficient way. Our analysis is comp/ementory, since it studies both the impacts of the computational power as well as the number of confirmations on the vulnerability of a blockchain network, providing a theoretical basis to design reasonable schemes for invigorating a blockchain network from technical as well as managerial levels. Extensive experiments carried out on a large-scale cloud plathirm running the Ethereum protocol show the experimental and analytical results match well, verifying the effectiveness of our analysis.

TI Decentralized Construction of Knowledge Graphs for Deep Recommender
   Systems Based on Blockchain-Powered Smart Contracts
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Since first coined by Google in 2012, knowledge graph has received extensive attention from both industry and academia, and has been widely used in many scenarios with success, e.g. information retrieval, online recommendation, question-answering, and so on. However, traditional centralized construction of knowledge graph faces many challenges, such as laborious and time-consuming, vulnerable to manipulation or tampering, lacking scrutiny, among others. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel decentralized knowledge graph construction method by means of crowdsourcing, and the business logic of crowdsourcing is implemented by blockchain-powered smart contracts to guarantee the transparency, integrity, and auditability. On this basis, the decentralized knowledge graph is used for a deep recommender system, and case studies validate the effectiveness of the system. This paper is aimed at providing a novel decentralized approach for constructing knowledge graph and serving as reference and guidance for future research and practical applications of knowledge graph.

AB Blockchain is an enabler of many emerging decentralized applications in areas of cryptocurrency, Internet of Things, smart health-care, among many others. Although various open-source blockchain frameworks are available in the form of virtual machine images or docker images on public clouds, the infrastructure of mainstream blockchains nonetheless exhibits a technical barrier for many users to modify or test out new research ideas in blockchains. To make it worse, many advantages of blockchain systems can be demonstrated only at large scales, e.g., thousands of nodes, which are not always available to researchers. This paper presents an accurate and efficient emulating system to replay the execution of large-scale blockchain systems on tens of thousands of nodes. In contrast to existing work that simulates blockchains with artificial timestamp injection, the proposed system is designed to be executing real proof-of-work workload along with peer-to-peer network communications and hash-based immutability. In addition, the proposed system employs a preprocessing approach to avoid the per-node computation overhead at runtime and thus achieves practical scales. We have evaluated the system for emulating up to 20,000 nodes on Amazon Web Services (AWS), showing both high accuracy and high efficiency with millions of transactions.

AB Token Curated Registries (TCR) are decentralized recommendation systems that can be implemented using Blockchain smart contracts. They allow participants to vote for or against adding items to a list through a process that involves staking tokens intrinsic to the registry, with winners receiving the staked tokens for each vote. A TCR aims to provide incentives to create a well-curated list. In this work, we consider a challenge for these systems- incentivizing token-holders to actually engage and participate in the voting process. We propose a novel token-inflation mechanism for enhancing engagement, whereby only voting participants see their token supply increased by a pre-defined multiple after each round of voting. To evaluate this proposal, we propose a simple 4-class model of voters that captures all possible combinations of two key dimenions: whether they are engaged (likely to vote at all for a given item) or disengaged, and whether they are informed (likely to vote in a way that increases the quality of the list) or uninformed, and a simple metric to evaluate the quality of the list as a function of the vote outcomes. We conduct simulations using this model of voters and show that implementing token-inflation results in greater wealth accumulation for engaged voters. In particular, when the number of informed voters is sufficiently high, our simulations show that voters that are both informed and engaged see the greatest benefits from participating in the registry when our proposed token-inflation mechanism is employed.

AB Cryptocurrency is playing an increasingly important role in reshaping the financial system due to its growing popular appeal and mechant acceptance. While many people are making investments in Cryptocurrency, the dynamical features, uncertainty, the predictability of Cryptocurrency are still mostly unknown, which dramatically risk the investments. It is a matter to try to understand the factors that infiuence the value formation. In this study, we use advanced artificial intelligence frameworks of fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network to analyse the price dynamics of Bitcoin, Etherum, and Ripple. We find that ANN tends to rely more on long-term history while LSTM tends to rely more on short-term dynamics, which indicate the efficiency of LSTM to utilise useful information hidden in historical memory is stronger than ANN. However, given enough historical information ANN can achieve a similar accuracy, compared with LSTM. This study provides a unique demonstration that Cryptocurrency market price is predictable. However, the explanation of the predictability could vary depending on the nature of the involved machine-learning model.

TI Cloud-Assisted EHR Sharing With Security and Privacy Preservation via
   Consortium Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The sharing of electronic health records (EHRs) has great positive significance for research of disease and doctors' diagnosis. In recent years, cloud-based electronic medical record sharing scheme has brought a lot of conveniences, but the centralization of cloud exposes threats inevitably to data security and privacy preservation. Blockchain technology can be seen as a promising solution to address these problems on account of its unique propertis of decentration, anonymity, unforgeability and verifiability. In this paper, we propose a blockchain based secure and privacy-preserving EHR sharing protocol. Data requester can search desired keyword from data provider to find relevant EHRs on the EHR consortium blockchain and get the re-encryption ciphertext from cloud server after getting the data owner's authorization. The scheme mainly uses searchable encryption and conditional proxy re-encryption to realize data security, privacy preservation, and access control. Furthermore, proof of authorization is designed as the consensus mechanism for consortium blockchain to guarantee system's availability. Security analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol can achieve security goals. Besides, we emulate the cryptographic primitives and implement the proposed scheme on Ethereum platform. Performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme has high computational efficiency.

AB Cryptocurrencies have recently gained a lot of attention because their high security and easy transaction. Among the current cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is the most well-known one. Application-specific ICs (ASICs) have been developed in order to deliver high throughput for Bitcoin mining. However, power dissipation is an important issue considering it causes increased mining cost and creates excessive heat. This paper presents three optimization techniques in the micro-architecture level for Bitcoin mining: deep pipelining, speculative computation, and approximate addition. The computations for Bitcoin milling are dominated by SHA-256, which can be realized by two-way 32-stage pipelines. Deep pipelining reduces the critical-path delay, resulting in less power due to architecture transformation and transistor sizing. The iterations of SHA-256 can be early terminated by leveraging speculative computation to prevent unnecessary switches. Approximate addition is adopted to reduce the critical-path delay of the compressor and expander at the cost of negligible precision loss. From the synthesis estimates at a 40-nm technology node, an overall 59.3% power reduction is achieved by applying these three techniques.

AB The existing approach to threat detection of dust transactions in a blockchain is conducted by setting a fixed amount of transactions. This is difficult to achieve due to the dynamic and variable nature of practical applications, so the performance is poor. This paper proposes a blockchain dust transaction threat detection model (BDTTDM) that uses the historical transactions generated in the blockchain as a vaccine for dust transaction detection. An artificial immune algorithm is used to detect dust transactions. The experimental results show that the dust transaction recognition rate by BDTTDM is 98.9%, which is 229.3% higher than that of the classic blockchain dust transaction model - Bitcoin Core client.

AB Blockchain has attracted a broad range of interests from start-ups, enterprises and governments to build next generation applications in a decentralized manner. Similar to cloud platforms, a single blockchain-based system may need to serve multiple tenants simultaneously. However, design of multi-tenant blockchain-based systems is challenging to architects in terms of data and performance isolation, as well as scalability. First, tenants must not be able to read other tenants' data and tenants with potentially higher workload should not affect read/write performance of other tenants. Second, multi-tenant blockchain-based systems usually require both scalability for each individual tenant and scalability with number of tenants. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scalable platform architecture for multi-tenant blockchain-based systems to ensure data integrity while maintaining data privacy and performance isolation. In the proposed architecture, each tenant has an individual permissioned blockchain to maintain their own data and smart contracts. All tenant chains are anchored into a main chain, in a way that minimizes cost and load overheads. The proposed architecture has been implemented in a proof-of-concept prototype with our industry partner, Laava ID Pty Ltd (Laava). We evaluate our proposal in a three-fold way: fulfilment of the identified requirements, qualitative comparison with design alternatives, and quantitative analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed architecture can achieve data integrity, performance isolation, data privacy, configuration flexibility, availability, cost efficiency and scalability.

AB In the big data era, it is a significant need for data sharing in various industries. However, there are many weaknesses in the traditional centralized way of data sharing. It is easy to attack the centralized data storage center. As the process of data asset transactions is not transparent, there is a lack of trust in the percipients of data sharing. Blockchain technology offers a possibility to solve these problems in data sharing, as the blockchain can provide a decentralized, programmable, tamperproof, and anonymous data sharing environment. In this paper, we compare the blockchain-based data sharing with the traditional ways of data sharing, and analyze the scenarios in major industry applications. We survey the state of the art of the adoption of blockchain technologies in data sharing, and provide a summary about their technical frameworks and schemes.

AB Mining pools in Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies allow miners to pool their computational resources as a means of reducing pay-out variance. In Ethereum, uncle blocks are valid Proof-of-Work solutions which do not become the head of the blockchain, yet yield rewards if later referenced by main chain blocks. Mining pool operators are faced with the non-trivial task of fairly distributing rewards for both block types among pool participants.
   Inspired by empirical observations, we formally reconstruct a Sybil attack exploiting the uncle block distribution policy in a queue-based mining pool. To ensure fairness of the queue-based payout scheme, we propose a mitigation. We examine the effectiveness of the attack strategy under the current and the proposed policy via a discrete-event simulation. Our findings show that the observed attack can indeed be obviated by altering the current reward scheme.

AB Blockchain-based applications usually consist of centralized elements (e.g., web servers and back-end logic) connected to decentralized elements such as smart contracts. The engineering of such hybrid software architectures poses a challenge as it is unclear which elements should be centralized or decentralized. Furthermore the impact of this decision (or the balance between those two areas) on software quality attributes such as security, maintainability, performance or costs is currently unknown. The goal is to build a software architecture using the benefits and handling the challenges of blockchain technology while fulfilling the relevant quality attributes. While there are several approaches examining the relation between architectural decisions and quality attributes in centralized systems, research is at an early stage for decentralized elements in software architectures. This paper presents a first step towards architectural blockchain tactics. With a simplified experiment comparing two implementation variants of an Ethereum smart contract we show that software design patterns are not always beneficial and that the expected usage scenarios have a strong impact on the operational costs. We argue that further research and validation is necessary for gaining more qualitative and quantitative insights to make informed architectural design decisions when using blockchain technology and give a first outline on how to achieve this.

AB With the advent of blockchain technologies, the idea of decentralized applications has gained traction. Smart contracts permit the implementation of application logic to foster distributed systems that are capable of removing intermediaries. Hereby, lock in effects originating from isolated data storage and central authorities are mitigated. Yet, smart contracts deployed to a ledger generate dependencies on the underlying blockchain. Over time, requirements regarding contract execution may detach from the utilized blockchain due to contradicting incentives and security or performance issues. To avoid a novel form of lock in effect towards a host blockchain, we introduce a concept for smart contract portability that permits any user to migrate contract logic and state between blockchains in a flexible and verifiable manner. As the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is supported by a multitude of blockchain implementations, it poses a common execution environment for smart contracts. We provide a toolbox that facilitates smart contract portability between EVM-compatible blockchains without trust requirements in the entity executing the migration process. To prove the concept's soundness, we transfer token contracts based on the ERC20 standard as well as applications containing dependencies to other smart contracts. Our evaluation shows the validity of ported applications including their current states.

AB The benefits of blockchain technology are evident in the banking industry as the underlying technology for cryptocurrencies. Recently, research has been focused on novel, non-cryptocurrency uses of blockchain for other industries such as national defense. Application of these technologies in military use cases requires special consideration of the limitations inherent to tactical military operations, namely the network communication technologies. In this work we explore the performance of blockchain technologies on network environments representative of those available in Department of Defense (DoD) tactical operations. Our experimentation with the Ethereum blockchain on a mobile network emulation reveals a series of verbose blockchain network communication protocols as well as a heavy reliance on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for block transfer and synchronization that may limit the effectiveness of blockchain on current DoD mobile ad hoc networks.

AB Since its deployment in 2009 the Blockchain technology has been getting a lot of attention in research, media as well as various industries. In the beginning, only financial related use cases were discussed and implemented, as the first real life and well-known implementation was Bitcoin. Since then many different types of Blockchains evolved. However, it is still unclear what the basic characteristics of a Blockchain are and how those interact to form different types of Blockchains. With this research, we therefore propose a taxonomy of the Blockchain technology to help form a better understanding of the technology itself and guide future research on how to differentiate the multiple types.

AB Smart contracts allow for exchange of coins according to program rules. While it is well known that so called bribery contracts can influence the incentive mechanism of a Nakamoto-style consensus, we present a more fine-grained bribery attack incentivizing a temporary censorship against a specific account. To this end, we introduce three different bribery contracts on the blockchain where each uniquely manipulates the rewards that a rational miner would receive. Additionally, we formalize the established bribery mechanisms as a Markov game and show for each game the existence of equilibria leading to successful censorships. Finally, we compare the bribery mechanisms with respect to the scalability of the attack costs and the strategic dominance. Our work is motivated by off-chain protocols including payment and state channels which require to publish transactions within a certain amount of time. In such off-chain protocols a temporary censorship attack can result into significant financial damage.

AB Cryptocurrency is a digital currency with cryptographic security so that it is not easily to be faked. Recently cryptocurrency is widely used for transactions. Therefore, preserving its integrity and security is important. The technology underlying the digital currency is the Blockchain, as applied to Fawkescoin. But for securing the transaction, fawkescoin has a disadvantage when the fork occurs because it can provide opportunity to conduct double spending attack. To overcome this problem, Merkle tree proposed by applying DSA digital signatures. The application of DSA on Merkle tree is used to verify data without knowing the contents of the data. Based on the experiment results and analysis, the security of the proposed method can prevent fawkescoin against double spending attack on transactions when forking occurs than the previous method.

AB Authentication is essential for sharing information in IoT and its secondary use with AI-capable machines. The aim is to support humans in optimizing risk of supply chains for industrial manufacturing and service provisioning in a timely manner. The ultimate aim is sustainability. The problem for deciding on authentication is probably imperfect information on compliance. Its asymmetric implications of the meaning of contracts for secure information sharing may cause vulnerability of data breach and misuse. A traditional way to avoid harm of that asymmetry requires authentic and consistent sharing of audit information on violation of a certification policy to a centralized audit intelligence. This information sharing is, however, subject to the problem of single point of failure of the centralized audit intelligence.With our work on Security by Design, we show a non-central approach of clarifying accountability to reduce the risk caused by asymmetric implications of the meaning of contracts on authentication. Our signaling and screening scheme SK4SC provides personal digital evidences on compliance to multilateral policies on using information or in other words on trustworthiness. Blockchains are used to realize their symmetric distribution while users share risk on accountability with competition on incentives in a privacy-enhancing manner. Customer relationship management with royalty points, e.g., for eGovernment with taxation, is an example for using SK4SC as digital platform.

AB Blockchains offer an interesting solution to some of the security challenges encountered in military applications. They are particularly attractive in the scenarios, where it is difficult or even impossible to establish a common root of trust, e.g., in the context of civil-military collaboration, where military organizations need to build trusted information exchange infrastructure with various types of civilian governmental and non-governmental organizations, local communities, commercial companies and private persons. In our work, we discuss how blockchain can be used to store metadata describing information collected from the IoT devices owned by the federation members as well as crowdsourced from sensors belonging to private users. We present a high level architecture for a metadata binding solution using blockchains compliant with STANAG 4774 and 4778. We also describe a concrete technical solution based on Hyperledger Fabric and some of the open issues.

TI A Study on Blockchain-based Circular Economy Credit Rating System
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGY
AB Circular economy is distinct from the linear economy model in the past. Circular economy emphasizes regeneration instead of possession of resource, and proposes using shared resources to create new supply chains and new economies. When practicing circular economy, prior to collaboration, each economic entity must learn of each other's credit rating. This study applies the blockchain technology to establish each economic entity's transaction details, and then employs confidence level algorithms to calculate each entity's credit rating; the method utilizes the concept of decentralization to reduce third party broker fees, which, aside from decreasing transaction costs, provides effective credit rating of public economic entities.

TI Application of Internet of Things and Blockchain Technologies to Improve
   Accounting Information Quality
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Following the rapid development and the maturity of blockchain (BC) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, this paper proposes two applications of a BC-IoT transaction model in the accounting field. The BC-IoT transaction model is capable of automatically collecting, uploading, and recording all relevant data in the enterprise transaction process under the premise of satisfying certain assumptions. This model does not require manual intervention at any point in the process; no data recorded on the distributed ledgers can be tampered with or revoked. The data collected using this model can be used as information on events, providing data support for the events approach to basic accounting theory. This practice responds to the important insight of sorter, who proposes the provision of accounting information in real time and on demand to substantially improve the usefulness of accounting information. This paper also identifies that BC technology can significantly improve the relevance, faithful representation, timeliness, comparability, and other aspects of accounting information quality.

AB Blockchain applications have shown huge potential in various domains. Proof of Work (PoW) is the key procedure in blockchain applications, which exhibits the memory-bound characteristic and hinders the performance improvement of blockchain accelerators. In order to mitigate the "memory wall" and improve the performance of memory-hard PoW accelerators, using Ethash as an example, we optimize the memory architecture from two perspectives: 1) Hiding memory latency. We propose specialized context switch design to overcome the uncertain cycles of repetitive memory requests. 2) Increasing memory bandwidth utilization. We introduce on-chip memory that stores a portion of the Ethash directed acyclic graph (DAG) for larger effective memory bandwidth, and further propose adopting embedded NOR flash to fulfill the role. Then, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of our optimized memory architecture for Ethash, including number of hash cores, on-chip/off-chip memory technologies and specifications. Based on the design space exploration, we finally provide the guidance for designing the memory-bound PoW accelerator. The experiment results show that our optimized designs achieve 8.7% - 55% higher hash rate and 17% - 120% higher hash rate per Joule compared with the baseline design in different configurations.

AB As networks are ubiquitous in the modern era, point anomalies have been changed to graph anomalies in terms of anomaly shapes. However, the specific-shape priors about anomalous subgraphs of interest are seldom considered by the traditional approaches when detecting the subgraphs in attributed graphs (e.g., computer networks, Bitcoin networks, and etc.). This paper proposes a nonlinear approach to specific-shape graph anomaly detection. The nonlinear approach focuses on optimizing a broad class of nonlinear cost functions via specific-shape constraints in attributed graphs. Our approach can be used to many different graph anomaly settings. The traditional approaches can only support linear cost functions (e.g., an aggregation function for the summation of node weights). However, our approach can employ more powerful nonlinear cost functions, and enjoys a rigorous theoretical guarantee on the near-optimal solution with the geometrical convergence rate.

AB The emergence of electronic medical records has provided great convenience for the storage and analysis of medical data. However, electronic medical records contain a large amount of personal privacy information, it is still very difficult to share medical information among various medical institutions. As the underlying technology of Bitcoin, blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, security, trustworthiness, collective maintenance, and cannot be tampered, it is suitable for data protection and sharing. In this paper, data masking technology and Inter Planetary File System (IPFS) are introduced to build a safe and efficient electronic medical record sharing model based on blockchain. The model can not only guarantee the security of medical data, but also save resources in blockchain.

AB Blockchain technologies are in the ascendant of transforming the ways we manage contracts, make transactions, and manifest ownership of property. The trend calls for a realistic testing and evaluation platform for blockchain applications and systems. We present Minichain, a container-based emulator that allows testing proof-of-work-based blockchains on a commodity computer. Minichain contains a realistic and configurable network environment, which is missing in today's blockchain testbeds. This unique feature enables us to evaluate the impact of network events (e.g., cyber-attacks) and conditions (e.g., congested or failed links) on blockchain applications. Meanwhile, Minichain allows the direct execution of unmodified application code in the containers for fidelity, and utilizes the virtual time technique to speed up experiments and improve the system scale that one can accurately emulate. In particular, we mathematically analyze the convergence of the proof-of-work-based consensus algorithm to show the effectiveness of virtual time. We evaluate the performance of Minichain across both network layer and application layer, and demonstrate its usability by emulating a selfish mining attack initiated from the network layer.

AB Recently, blockchain techniques have been widely used in finance, e-commerce and sharing economy, owing to its decentralization, openness and permission-less properties. In cybersecurity, a blockchain-based framework Sapiens Chain is proposed, which aims to provide decentralized and trustable cybersecurity services while protecting the privacy of the anonymous users. However, how to select an optimal service provider in Sapiens Chain remains challenging. In this paper, we tackle the novel problem of scheduling nodes in Sapiens Chain, which covers and rewards the nodes based on their performance with the history of providing cybersecurity services, and thus attracting more and more users to anticipate cybersecurity services. Under the scheduling algorithm, we propose to select nodes for different tasks by unifying the interest of each user, such as the bandwidth, the computing resource, and the activation degree. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

AB With the adjustment of the world's energy structure, the proportion of clean energy represented by renewable energy is increasing. In response to the shortcomings of renewable energy instability, researchers have proposed the concept of the microgrid. However, with the expansion of the scale of the promotion of the microgrid, the traditional energy distribution system with the sales company as the core exposes the shortcomings of being inflexible. Based on this researcher's continuous exploration of new energy trading models, the energy blockchain has developed rapidly in recent years. Reliable private key storage is a necessary guarantee for the security of energy blockchain services. At present, blockchain private key storage technology still has many security risks in the new energy transaction mode. This paper first builds an energy blockchain platform inside the microgrid, so that all participants can complete energy transactions more safely and conveniently. At the same time, the energy blockchain private key storage technology based on image information hiding is proposed. The blockchain private key is hidden in the watermark information and embedded in the carrier image. A watermarking algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform and quantization index modulation is used to accurately extract the blockchain private key. Finally, the feasibility and security of the algorithm are proved by an example test analysis.

As a decentralized distributed technology, the blockchain has become one of the most promising Internet applications, and its application in the power balance trading platform has also received extensive attention. In view of the information asymmetry between the trading center and the margin trading users in the power balance trading platform, it is difficult to guarantee the fairness of the transaction and affect the actual income of the production consumers. First, we analyze the trading mechanism of the power surplus market.Then we designed a smart contract for multi-party bidding power resources based on blockchain technology, and achieved the decentralized power trading decision to ensure the information is symmetric and fair.At the same time, the credibility model is established by analyzing the user's recent transaction records, and we design a corresponding punishment mechanism to strengthen the constraint on the execution of offline point-to-point power transactions.

AB In recent years, the rapid urbanization of world's population causes many economic, social, and environmental problems, which affect people's living conditions and quality of life significantly. The concept of "smart city" brings opportunities to solve these urban problems. The objectives of smart cities are to make the best use of public resources, provide high-quality services to the citizens, and improve the people's quality of life. Information and communication technology plays an important role in the implementation of smart cities. Blockchain as an emerging technology has many good features, such as trust-free, transparency, pseudonymity, democracy, automation, decentralization, and security. These features of blockchain are helpful to improve smart city services and promote the development of smart cities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving blockchain technology applied to smart cities. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we review how blockchain technology is applied in the realm of smart cities, from the perspectives of smart citizen, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, supply chain management, and others. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.

AB Many chatbots have been developed that provide a multitude of services through a wide range of methods. A chatbot is a brand-new conversational agent in the highspeed changing technology world. With the advance of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, chatbots are becoming more and more popular. A chatbot is the extension of human interface mediums such as the phone and social platforms. Similarly, Cryptocurrency is a new extension of digital or virtual currency designed to work as a medium of exchange. In the current digital exchanging world, investors and interested parties are eager to know more information about, and the capabilites of, this new type of currency. One of the potential paths to retrieve the info automatically and quickly is through a chatbot. We explored the open source python library, Chatterbot, to apply Itchat API (a WeChat interface) with the aim of building a robot chatting application, I&C Chat, on the topic of cryptocurrency. First, we collected question and answer pairs datasets from Quora websites. Furthermore, we also created API calls to query the real time quote for the top 25 cryptocurrencies. Then we used the collected data to train our chatbot and implemented a logic adapter to receive the price quote of cryptocurrencies based on the incoming question. The Itchat API method will return the best matched answer to the asking party automatically. The response time of different questions has been investigated. The results imply that this application is quite useful, feasible and beneficial to the digital currency world.

AB In the current Bitcoin network, lightweight clients outsource most of the computational and storage tasks to full blockchain nodes in order to run on resource-constrained devices, such as mobile phones. In the interactions with the full node, the lightweight client leaks considerable information about the Bitcoin transactions or addresses associated with this client. Therefore, the benefit of using lightweight client comes at costs of privacy. Existing solutions cannot support the lightweight client to retrieve the relevant transactions from the full node in an efficient and privacy-preserving way. In this paper, we propose a new approach to protect the privacy of lightweight clients in Bitcoin. Our main idea is to use private information retrieval (PIR) to guarantee that the lightweight clients can fetch the relevant transactions from untrusted full nodes without revealing to those nodes which particular transactions are being fetched. Directly using existing PIR scheme incurs high communication overhead for lightweight clients. Therefore, we propose an optimized protocol utilizing two-step PIR to efficiently retrieve the queried transactions without leaking sensitive query information. We developed a prototype implementation to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed scheme.

TI A Key Protection Scheme Based on Secret Sharing for Blockchain-Based
   Construction Supply Chain System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Traditional construction supply chains suffer from extra delays, costs and information wastages due to information intermediaries. Blockchain, a decentralized infrastructure, can provide irreversibility, undeniableness, uniqueness and anonymity for trades. Hence, we first propose a blockchain-based construction supply chain framework to reduce limitations in traditional ones. However, payment security by blockchain must be guaranteed and token assets in accounts must be protected. Although the loss of private keys will not result in the exposure or the modification of records in blockchain due to merkle root and blockheader hash, fake payments can be generated and all tokens in the accounts controlled by the private keys may be stolen by attackers. Existing approaches towards private-key protections include biometric-basic signature schemes, index-hidden private key designs and post-quantum blockchain schemes. Nevertheless, none of them can recover lost private keys. Therefore, we design a private-key distribution protocol in blockchains to preserve security of private keys with key recovery. Specifically, our scheme not only uses secret sharing to improve possibilities of recovering lost keys but also introduces network protocols to guarantee security of secret share transmission. The proposed scheme is then proven secure and feasible both in theoretical and experimental analysis.

TI A Blockchain-Based Privacy-Awareness Authentication Scheme With
   Efficient Revocation for Multi-Server Architectures
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Multi-server authentication technology has become more and more popular with the extensive applications of networks. Although it has brought great convenience to people's life, security becomes a critical issue and attracts lots of attentions in both academia and industry. Over the past two decades, a series of multi-server authentication schemes without communication with the online registration center in each authentication phase using the self-certified public key cryptography have been proposed to enhance security. However, it may cause the single-point failure problem due to the centralized architecture. Besides, user revocation facility is not well resolved in these schemes. To the best of our knowledge, blockchain technology has lots of advantages, bringing a promising solution to the problems of single-point failure and user revocation compared with the traditional cryptography technologies. In this work, we apply the idea of blockchain technology to construct a privacy-awareness authentication scheme for the multi-server environment, which can achieve distributed registry and efficient revocation. Moreover, the proposed scheme not only provides multiple security requirements like mutual authentication, user anonymity and perfect forward secrecy, but also resists various kinds of malicious attacks. The security of the proposed scheme is proved by rigorous formal proof using the random oracle model. Compared with recently related schemes, the proposed scheme has better communication performance, which make it be very suitable for real-life applications.

TI Smart Contract Based Data Trading Mode Using Blockchain and Machine
   Learning
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB There are two traditional data trading modes, the hosting mode, and the aggregation mode, which depend on the trusted third parties to a large extent. The hosting mode is that the data are completely hosted in the data trading center, so the data trading center retains the data. On the surface, the aggregation mode is that the data trading center is not to retain the data of trading, but actually, it has the ability to retain the data. There is a fundamental difference between the ability to retain the data and the inability to retain the data. These two trading modes cause the data owners to be afraid to share data trading. In this paper, we propose a solution to the data trading mode based on the smart contract using blockchain and machine learning. Our solution takes advantage of the immutability, tamper-proof and traceability of blockchain, the programmability of smart contract, and the verification of data availability by the similarity learning to propose a challenge response mechanism between the data purchaser and the data owner, an off-chain download mechanism between the data purchaser and the data storage service provider, and an arbitration mechanism for the controversy resolution of the data trading. The challenge response mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data owner, the off-chain download mechanism is used to authenticate and authorize the data purchaser to download the purchased data, and the similarity learning is used to deal with the controversy over the data availability in the data trading. The design and implementation of data trading smart contract successfully achieved the goal of removing the trusted third party in the data trading, and thus, the problem that the data trading center has the ability to retain the data in the process of the data trading is solved, as well as the automatic payment by using the Ethereum encrypted currency among the trading participants is realized. This paper presents the whole process of smart contract from the design and implementation to the test completion and provides the security analysis and performance evaluation. The full code of smart contract and the ABI interface have been uploaded to the GitHub for the public release.

AB Imaging studies are one of the leading drivers of modern medical decision making, and thus, their accessibility to healthcare providers and patients is of critical importance. However, current techniques for storage and transferring medical imaging data are inconvenient and sometimes wholly inadequate. In this paper, we propose a decentralized autonomous medical image processing approach using blockchain technology. Blockchain will enable the sharing of key relevant data using a distributed, decentralized, shared ledger that is available to participants. We outline a framework that utilizes blockchain to enable users to access imaging data in a secure and autonomous manner. A user case is experimentally investigated to validate our proposed approach.

TI Gecko: A Resilient Dispersal Scheme for Multi-Cloud Storage
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB We have entered an era where copious amounts of sensitive data are being stored in the cloud. To meet the rising privacy, reliability, and verifiability needs, we propose Gecko, a multi-cloud dispersal scheme where: (a) the key used to encrypt the data file is the secret in a Latin-square-autotopism secret-sharing scheme, (b) data files and encryption keys are dispersed separately to multiple clouds, and (c) a blockchain-based integrity-check protocol is devised to pinpoint faulty data. Gecko enables fast and thorough key renewal: when a portion of the key (the secret) is leaked, we replace all shares of the partially-leaked secret without replacing the secret itself; this immediately resists targeted attack to certain file without re-encrypting the data file itself. Key renewal is further accelerated by the blockchain-based integrity check. We evaluate Gecko theoretically and experimentally against the traditional AONT-RS dispersal scheme, drawing two conclusions: 1) Gecko admits powerful key renewal and identification of damaged data, with a minor transfer overhead; and 2) Gecko performs key renewal three to five times faster than AONT-RS hybrid-slice renewal (the closest thing AONT-RS has to key renewal).

AB The first step in online shopping is, apparently, to choose a reliable supplier. However, consumers and merchants may have different perceptions of product quality, and this may result in business disputes. The dispute about buying inferior goods may be caused from simple product photos or merchants make over the top claims about their products. This dispute problem cannot be resolved completely, even though customers choose reputable e-commerce companies, e.g., Amazon. com and Alibaba. com. In the final analysis, the cause is that e-commerce companies do not adopt quality rating to evaluate products. If there is an alliance, among e-commerce companies and trusted organizations, which establishes credible product grading system PGS), online shoppers may buy genuine product at a fair price from this e-commerce alliance. In this paper, we propose blockchain based PGS BPGS) to deal with big data for this business model. The blockchain is a decentralized technology, and thus we can speed up the verification of product grading. In addition, for the proposed BPGS, 51% of attacks cannot be completed unless 51% of merchants and e-commerce companies in this alliance are simultaneously compromised. Therefore, our e-commerce environment based on BPGS is not only reliable but also secure.

TI Delegated Proof of Stake With Downgrade: A Secure and Efficient
   Blockchain Consensus Algorithm With Downgrade Mechanism
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology has a wide range of applications in the fields of finance, credit reporting and intellectual property, etc. As the core of blockchain, consensus algorithm affects the security and performance of blockchain system directly. In the past 10 years, there have been about 30 consensus algorithms such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA) and AlgoRand. But their security, stability and operating efficiency still lag far behind our actual needs. This paper introduces the computing power competition of PoW into DPoS to design an improved consensus algorithm named Delegated Proof of Stake with Downgrade (DDPoS). Through the further modification, the impact of both computing resources and stakes on generating blocks is reduced to achieve higher efficiency, fairness, and decentralization in consensus process. Then a downgrade mechanism is proposed to quickly replace the malicious nodes to improve the security. The simulation experiments in blockchain system show that the proposed consensus algorithm is significantly more efficient than PoW and PoS, but slightly lower than DPoS. However, its degree of centralization remains far below that of DPoS. And through the downgrade mechanism, the proposed consensus algorithm can detect and downgrade the malicious nodes timely to ensure the security and good operation of system.

AB Ethereum's Gas mechanism attempts to set transaction fees in accordance with the computational cost of transaction execution: a cost borne by default by every node on the network to ensure correct smart contract execution. Gas encourages users to author transactions that are efficient to execute and in so doing encourages node diversity, allowing modestly resourced nodes to join and contribute to the security of the network.
   However, the effectiveness of this scheme relies on Gas costs being correctly aligned with observed computational costs in reality. In this work, we performed the first large scale empirical study to understand to what degree this alignment exists in practice, by collecting and analyzing Tera-bytes worth of nanosecond-precision transaction execution traces. Besides confirming potential denial-of-service vectors, our results also shed light on the role of I/O in transaction costs which remains poorly captured by the current Gas cost model. Finally, our results suggest that under the current Gas cost model, nodes with modest computational resources are disadvantaged compared to their better resourced peers, which we identify as an ongoing threat to node diversity and network decentralization.

AB In traditional cloud computing system, searchable encryption is deemed as a core technology to realize data confidentiality protection and information retrieval functions. However, the online payment problem and mutual distrust between cloud platforms and users may hinder the wide adoption of cloud service. In this paper, we construct a blockchain based multi-keyword ranked search with fair payment (BMFP) system, which leverages smart contracts to verify the correctness and completeness of the search result, and automatically execute the fair payment operations. The system realizes public verifiability on a multi-keyword ranked search result. The data owner manages the search authority, and a concrete fair payment smart contract is designed. The BMFP is compatible with Ethereum, and the verification algorithm executed by the smart contract is cost-efficient.

AB Anonymity networks and hidden services like those accessible in Tor, also called the "darknet", in combination with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin provide a relatively safe environment for criminal online activities. While this is a challenge for law enforcement, it brings opportunities for researchers to monitor these activities as they are often not really hidden but rather obfuscated and/or anonymized. In this paper we discuss such a monitoring approach for product sales in the darknet. We collect bitcoin addresses and data about product offerings in a number of shops run as hidden services in Tor. We then analyze transactions in the bitcoin blockchain that can be mapped to specific product sales in these shops.

TI PBCert: Privacy-Preserving Blockhain-Based Certificate Status Validation
   Toward Mass Storage Management
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In the recent years, the vulnerabilities of conventional public key infrastructure are exposed by the real-world attacks, such as the certificate authority's single-point-of-failure or clients' private information leakage. Aimed at the first issue, one type of approach is that multiple entities are introduced to assist the certificate operations, including registration, update, and revocation. However, it is inefficient in computation. Another type is to make the certificate information publicly visible by bringing in the log servers. Nevertheless, the data synchronization among log servers may lead to network latency. Based on the second approach, the blockchain-based public key infrastructure schemes are proposed. Through these type of schemes, all the certificate operations are stored in the blockchain for public audit. However, the issue of revoked certificates' status storage is worth paying attention, especially in the setting with massive certificates. In addition, the target web server that a client wants to access is exposed in the process of certificate status validation. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving blockchain-based certificate status validation scheme called PBCert to solve these two issues. First, we separate the revoked certificates control and storage plane. Only the minimal control information (namely, certificate hashes and related operation block height) is stored in the blockchain and it uses external data stores for the detailed information about all revoked certificates. Second, we design an obscure response to the clients' certificate status query for the purpose of privacy preserving. Through the security analysis and experiment evaluation, our scheme is significant in practice.

AB A blockchain is a technology that allows transactions to be processed and committed data to be shared among participants without a central server. To implement applications among restricted parties with permission such as asset sales and trades, a special type of blockchain system called a private blockchain is used. Additionally, the demand for privacy preservation where sensitive information such as the trade amounts and balances is not disclosed is increasing. However, privacy preservation in a typical blockchain setting is difficult because it prevents parties that are not involved in the transaction from checking the correctness of the transaction being processed, which may lead to unintended or invalid transactions. To address this issue, herein we propose a protocol that allows the consistency with regard to the transaction amount and the balance to be checked without disclosing their values. Specifically, we exploit a homomorphic encryption to encrypt the transaction amount and balance. Thus, the correctness of a transaction can be publicly verified by the parties using the zero-knowledge proof without a trusted third party.

This paper discusses the scheme and delivery of project based learning in computer science engineering as major project which adopts undergraduate creativities and emphasizes on real-world, open-ended projects. These projects foster a wide range of abilities, not only those related to content knowledge or technical skills, but also practical skills. The goal for this innovative undergrad project is to show how a trained machine model can predict the price of a cryptocurrency if we give the right amount of data and computational power. It displays a graph with the predicted values. The most popular technology is the kind of technological solution that could help mankind predict future events. With vast amount of data being generated and recorded on a daily basis, we have finally come close to an era where predictions can be accurate and be generated based on concrete factual data. Furthermore, with the rise of the crypto digital era more heads have turned towards the digital market for investments. This gives us the opportunity to create a model capable of predicting crypto currencies primarily Bitcoin. This can be accomplished by using a series of machine learning techniques and methodologies.

AB Today, Internet of Things (IoT) technology is applied to everywhere providing tremendous amounts of IoT service such as home control, facility management, and social public services. The GS1, a non-profit international standard organization, standardized an Object Name Service (ONS) which enables users to manage and discover services in the midst of tremendous amounts of service. However, it has a vulnerability in security and fault tolerance of providing service, because the ONS operates based on the DNS protocol. It is weak against data tampering attacks caused by DNS cache poisoning, spoofing, and local DNS cracking. It has a weak fault tolerance from problems with attack or malfunction. In this paper, we propose a BlockONS, which is novel ONS based on a blockchain. It provides a strength in data tampering attacks allowing a fault tolerance for sustainable service. The BlockONS consists of new service data modeling for an off-chain scaling, data tampering validation method, and fault tolerance mechanism. We designed the BlockONS into two parts: a BlockONS Node part to valid data tampering, and a BlockONS Agent part for scaling and fault tolerance. Finally, we implement the BlockONS prototype using a Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain and intel i5 NUC. We proof the feasibility of the BlockONS by comparing with performance of an existing ONS.

AB As a new type of asset, the value of big data resources can only be realized in the transaction circulation. Establishing and improving the big data trading platform market system is a systematic project to transform data from resources into assets. Through the comparative analysis of several typical big data trading platform construction practices in China, this research finds some problems, such as unclear positioning of some platforms leading to overlapping functions, extensive data transaction, lack of unified data pricing methods, unclear data ownership. In addition, there is no difference between the data escrow transaction mode and the aggregate transaction mode, and the rights of the data supply parties cannot be guaranteed. And it also discusses how to promote the construction and improvement of China's big data trading market more systematically, normally and institutionally. Finally, it proposes to build local big data trading platforms according to local conditions, establish a data transaction system based on blockchain, establish a big data transaction pricing index system, and establish a big data standard system.

TI Collusion attacks and fair time-locked deposits for fast-payment
   transactions in Bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY
AB In Bitcoin network, the distributed storage of multiple copies of the block chain opens up possibilities for double-spending, i.e., a payer issues two separate transactions to two different payees transferring the same coins. While Bitcoin has inherent security mechanism to prevent double-spending attacks, it requires a certain amount of time to detect the double-spending attacks after the transaction has been initiated. Therefore, it is impractical to protect the payees from suffering in double-spending attacks in fast payment scenarios where the time between the exchange of currency and goods or services is shorten to few seconds. Although we cannot prevent double-spending attacks immediately for fast payments, decentralized non-equivocation contracts have been proposed to penalize the malicious payer after the attacks have been detected. The basic idea of these contracts is that the payer locks some coins in a deposit when he initiates a transaction with the payee. If the payer double-spends, a cryptographic primitive called accountable assertions can be used to reveal his Bitcoin credentials for the deposit. Thus, the malicious payer could be penalized by the loss of deposit coins. However, such decentralized non-equivocation contracts are subjected to collusion attacks where the payer colludes with the beneficiary of the depoist and transfers the Bitcoin deposit back to himself when he double-spends, resulting in no penalties. On the other hand, even if the beneficiary behaves honestly, the victim payee cannot get any compensation directly from the deposit in the original design.
   To prevent such collusion attacks, we design fair time-locked deposits for Bitcoin transactions to defend against double-spending. The fair deposits ensure that the payer will be penalized by the loss of his deposit coins if he double-spends and the victim payee's loss will be compensated within a locked time period. We start with the protocols of making a deposit for one transaction. In particular, for the transaction with single input and output and the transaction with multiple inputs and outputs, we provide different designs of the deposits. We analyze the performance of deposits made for one transaction and show how the fair deposits work efficiently in Bitcoin. We also provide protocols of making a deposit for multiple transactions, which can reduce the burdens of a honest payer. In the end, we extend the fair deposits to non-equivocation contracts for other distributed systems.

AB Blockchain technology has been developed for cryptocurrency systems. Bitcoin, the most famous cryptocurrency type, guarantees a safe consensus using the Proof of Work (PoW) process. The PoW scheme is currently operating as a basic consensus algorithm for blockchain systems that are used widely in various industries. However, the PoW algorithm lacks in support of mathematical analysis, which hinders discoveries of potential weaknesses and flaws in the blockchain system. Therefore, in this paper, the correlation between the key parameters (i.e., TPS, difficulty, miners) in a blockchain system are analyzed based on mathematical analysis.

TI Trust-Based Shard Distribution Scheme for Fault-Tolerant Shard
   Blockchain Networks
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchains guarantee data integrity through consensus of distributed ledgers based on multiple validation nodes called miners. For this reason, any blockchain system can be critically disabled by a malicious attack from a majority of the nodes (e.g., 51% attack). These attacks are more likely to succeed as the number of nodes required for consensus is smaller. Recently, as blockchains are becoming too large (making them difficult to store, send, receive, and manage), sharding is being considered as a technology to help improve the transaction throughput and scalability of blockchains. Sharding distributes block validators to disjoint sets to process transactions in parallel. Therefore, the number of validators of each shard group is smaller, which makes shard-based blockchains more vulnerable to 51% attacks than blockchains that do not use sharding. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a trust-based shard distribution (TBSD) scheme that assigns potential malicious nodes in the network to different shards, preventing malicious nodes from gaining a dominating influence on the consensus of a single shard. TBSD uses a trust-based shard distribution scheme to prevent malicious miners from gathering in on one shard by integration of a trust management system and genetic algorithm (GA). First, the trust of all nodes is computed based on the previous consensus result. Then, a GA is used to compute the shard distribution set to prevent collusion of malicious miners. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed TBSD scheme results in a shard distribution with a higher level of fairness than existing schemes, which provides an improved level of protection against malicious attacks.

AB The subject of scientific research is economic relations arising in the process of establishing the value of Bitcoin in the financial market. The hypothesis that the Bitcoin market is really subject to the formation of financial bubbles, and that the most significant of them was observed in 2017. The phenomenon of cryptocurrency has arisen quite recently and, therefore, at present there are very few empirical and theoretical studies related to this problem. It should be noted that the interest of the scientific community in digital money is growing every year. The digitization of the financial segment is a priority in the framework of Russia's economic growth. As part of the research, the Bitcoin market was analyzed. Several financial bubbles have been identified, and an econometric model of the behavior of the Bitcoin value in the digital virtual instruments market has also been compiled. The relevance and debatable nature of the theoretical and methodological foundations of cryptocurrency in different markets, the high practical significance of digital money in the modern economic system predetermined the goal and objectives, determined the choice of the object of study. Purpose of the study: bitcoin cost behavior modeling in the digital finance market based on time series. The methodological basis of the present study includes the methods of system-structural, functional, factor and comparative analysis with the construction of analytical models based on the synthesis of modern scientific methods of knowledge of economic and social phenomena. The methodological tools of scientific research are graphic, analytical, statistical and economic-mathematical methods of information processing.

AB Over the last fifty years, medical treatment has seen remarkable advancement, however, the data management and storage systems of medical records has lagged in comparison. In addition, these systems are often inharmonious across platforms and do not put the privacy desires of patients first. While HIPAA and other laws are put in place to protect patient medical record security and privacy, these antiquated systems inherently hinder patient security and privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel data sharing and management scheme that empowers patients over their records by leveraging the security and privacy benefits of blockchain and smart contracts. In comparison to current methods for healthcare records management, our proposed scheme empower patients over their records and minimizes the dependencies on recordgenerating institutions. It also allows the patients to selectively share their records and disclose certain parts with specific data users based on the privacy preferences desired. In our security and privacy analysis, we show that patients can protect against potential threats to securely and privately share their records. Moreover, in our performance discussions, we show that smart contract design and development is key.

AB In this paper, we present the idea of proof of sincerity for a new consensus method for mobile-user-friendly blockchains. Ever since the birth of Bitcoin, there have been many distributed consensus methods studied to replace the central (or third-party) trusts to protect the integrity of the distributed ledgers. Existing methods show pros and cons but none of them showed a proper balance between the imbalance of wealth and the security of the ledgers. In proof of sincerity, by allowing each and every entity even with smaller computing power to get rewarded by mining, we can effectively prevent the extreme imbalance of the wealth (often caused by the mining that is dominated by a small number of huge resource owners). At the same time, by maintaining the appropriate level of sincerity in terms of the combination of the number of miners and the level of each mining work, we can effectively maintain the security level of the distributed ledgers.

AB The widespread use of sensorial technologies has created new opportunities for enterprises, as these new sources of data assist in increasing the context-awareness in which enterprises operate and enable them to better anticipate and adapt to changes in the business environment. This leads to better decision making and greater profitability, as well as to reduced operating risks. However, if enterprises are to get any benefit from these new data sources, there is a need for tools, which will enable them to deal with the complexity of the multitude of data sources, both from physical and virtual objects, as well as a means to extract relevant and correct information and knowledge from it. Having access to data is not enough. The real value to enterprises comes from being able to process it, interpret it and being able to make accurate forecasts upon which they can base their business decisions. This paper presents the blockchain technology which is intended to support the development of sensing enterprise systems for intelligent knowledge management. Since the creation of the internet, blockchain is the most important technology created that is in constant development and has still much more to develop. In a simple way, blockchain is a computational technology for register of operations, decentralized, free-access, transparent, global, continuous. It is a public database that is accessible for everyone and is much more secure and reliable than other forms currently known to perform similar operations. Thus, it is intended to demonstrate the importance of this recent technology in business processes and the future trends of its use in sensing enterprise business processes. The proposed framework intends to demonstrate and serve as the foundation for new business models supported by the new capabilities provided by sensorial technologies in the support of enterprise applications.

AB We study the computation contests where players compete for searching a solution to a given problem with a winner-take-all reward. The search processes are independent across the players and the search speeds of players are proportional to their computational powers. One concrete application of this abstract model is the mining process of proof-of-work type blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin. Although one's winning probability is believed to be proportional to his computational power in previous studies on Bitcoin, we show that it is not the case in the strict sense.
   Because of the gaps between the winning probabilities and the proportions of computational powers, the Matthew effect will emerge in the system, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In addition, we show that allowing the players to pool with each other or reducing the number of solutions to the problem may aggravate the Matthew effect and vice versa.

AB Aiming at the problem that a large number of students' electronic deposit data is easy to forge and destroy, a student electronic deposit application architecture based on blockchain is proposed. There are some features on blockchain, such as decentralized, the non-tamperable of data, the consensus mechanism and data encryption features, and the electronic depository network. All these features provide a secure and credible storage environment, ensures the traceable of the student's electronic deposit information, the trust of the entire network, and the security of the data. At the same time, an improved PBFT consensus algorithm is proposed, which eliminates the certificate elimination phase to reduce network resource consumption, and constructs a decentralized electronic depository platform in combination with the blockchain to realize the authenticity, integrity and reliability of the electronic certificate data.

We then study quantum money and quantum lightning, showing the following results:
   We demonstrate the usefulness of quantum lightning beyond quantum money by showing several potential applications, such as generating random strings with a proof of entropy, to completely decentralized cryptocurrency without a block-chain, where transactions is instant and local.
   We give Either/Or results for quantum money/lightning, showing that either signatures/hash functions/commitment schemes meet very strong recently proposed notions of security, or they yield quantum money or lightning. Given the difficulty in constructing public key quantum money, this suggests that natural schemes do attain strong security guarantees.
   We show that instantiating the quantum money scheme of Aaronson and Christiano [STOC'12] with indistinguishability obfuscation that is secure against quantum computers yields a secure quantum money scheme. This construction can be seen as an instance of our Either/Or result for signatures, giving the first separation between two security notions for signatures from the literature.
   Finally, we give a plausible construction for quantum lightning, which we prove secure under an assumption related to the multi-collision resistance of degree-2 hash functions. Our construction is inspired by our Either/Or result for hash functions, and yields the first plausible standard model instantiation of a non-collapsing collision resistant hash function. This improves on a result of Unruh [Eurocrypt'16] which is relative to a quantum oracle.

AB Rural areas in developing countries have constantly been plagued by poor sanitation and energy shortages. A key issue has been the decentralized nature of waste generation and energy consumption, leading to farmers burning crop stocks, lumber, and other agricultural waste. As 1.9 billion people lack access to waste collection services [1], untreated solid and liquid refuse hamper the health of many and irreversibly damage the local ecosystem. Considering the scattered nature of agricultural waste generation and centralized treatment difficulties, this study examines the feasibility of adopting decentralized blockchain system in trading biomass energy and agricultural products across the waste-to-energy ecosystem. A case study is conducted based on the Yitong system in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province, China. This plant collects and transports agricultural wastes (crop straw and animal residue), and converts them to clean energy and agricultural by-products like briquettes, fertilizer, and animal feedstock. This paper presents how a digital coupon or cryptocurrency can be introduced to trade the wastes, energy and byproducts among the farmers and entrepreneurs. It argues that this system could maximize the use of agriculture wastes by incentivizing farmers and enterprises to work together. This paper covers three key areas:
   1) Literature review, methodology preparation, and field assessment for introducing digital incentive mechanism to enhance rural wastes management.
   2) Design of a prototype of blockchain-based model: (a) how the waste-to-energy plant managers collect the segregated waste from individual farmers through trucks connected to blockchain-based smart meters; (b) how systems on each of the trucks register the quantity of waste received onto a universal ledger when collecting. This quantity received will be translated into a certain amount of energy and products like fertilizer that the waste-to-energy plant owes each farm; and (c) how the farmers will receive digital coupons corresponding to the quantity of energy and agricultural products that they should receive.
   3) Evaluation of the feasibility of blockchain-based model (technical and economic): (a) data collection on the total quantity of waste produced and the processing capabilities and availability of Waste to Energy plants; (b) assessing readiness of digital infrastructure (cyber-security and communications); and (c) economic evaluation of the incentives and responsibilities associated with the key stakeholders from the farmers to enterprises.

AB Blockchain is an emerging decentralized architecture and distributed public ledger technology underlying Bitcoin, and has recently attracted intensive attention from governments, financial institutions and high-tech enterprises. It is believed that blockchain can improve efficiency, reduce costs and enhance data security, but it is still in the face of serious privacy issues which may hinder the wide application of blockchain. In this paper, We present a practical scheme by adding the Identity-Based encryption system, which effectively improves the data privacy for non-transaction applications. Analyses show that our proposal has a high security level which can prevent both disguise and passive attacks, and is functional, effective and practical in many applications for non-transactional scenarios.

AB Successful global supply chain management (SCM) traceability refers to 'the ability to identify and trace the history, distribution, location and application of products, parts and materials, to ensure the reliability of sustainability claims, in the areas of human rights, labor (including health and safety), the environmental factors and anticorruption. In response to the problem of cross-border telecommunications fraud crimes, we have proposed a conceptual system that enables the rapid sharing of intelligence information across all branches of the country. The decentralized blockchain network has a global flow of information and does not require high service costs and transaction costs, greatly improving cross-border collaboration efficiency. We use Ethereum smart contract to schedule visits to the system in different storage departments. The system can provide early warning and track cross-border economic crime intelligence according to ABB's provision of big data. CA and PBC provide information flow and capital flow. The blockchain concept architecture has also been evaluated for its advantages in project security, privacy and interoperability.

TI A Privacy Protection Scheme of Microgrid Direct Electricity Transaction
   Based on Consortium Blockchain and Continuous Double Auction
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Low cost, high efficiency, price transparency, and timely settlement of transactions are required for direct transactions between electricity providers and consumers in the microgrids. So the blockchain technology and the continuous double auction mechanism for direct electricity trading have always been a hot topic in the field of microgrids.In order to further reduce the transaction cost of blockchain and increase the transaction efficiency, and to solve the problem of lack of privacy protection for continuous double auction in the existing scheme, a privacy protection scheme of microgrids direct electricity transaction based on consortium blockchain and the continuous double auction is proposed. In it, the combination of consortium blockchain technology and continuous double auction mechanism is applied to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of transactions. In the meanwhile, pseudonyms and pseudonym certificates are generated by fair blind signature technology to realize identity privacy in the continuous double auction. And decentralization and user identity traceability are achieved by using (t, n) threshold secret sharing technology which distributes and recovers the private key of a trusted third party. The theoretical security analysis shows that the privacy protection scheme has higher security. The simulation experiment shows that the consortium blockchain technology has lower cost and higher efficiency in this scheme.

AB Blockchain is one of the most popular distributed ledger technologies. In order to solve the trustless problems between enterprises, many permissioned blockchain platforms are proposed in recent years. Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain which is comprised of chaincode, endorsing peers, ordering service, committing peers and membership service. Fabric provides identity authentication, transactions encryption and high performance. Hence, decentralized application based on Fabric can be applied among enterprises to implement the immutable and high throughput for transactions. However, some limitations still exist in Fabric framework. This paper surveys the risk of non-deterministic transactions in Fabric, which can be caused by read-write conflict and transactions order dependency. Transactions are judged to be invalid by committing peers when read-write conflict exists. Besides, transactions submission order may be disrupted during endorsing and ordering. Both of the two risks can make the final transaction execution result nondeterministic. Finally, a solution of cache layer on Fabric client is proposed to solve the risk of non-deterministic transactions.

TI Adaptive Traffic Signal Control Mechanism for Intelligent Transportation
   Based on a Consortium Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The development of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has facilitated adaptive traffic signal control for intelligent transportation. In this paper, we proposed the traffic signal control mechanism based on a consortium blockchain, which has saved plenty of financial and material resources. It has solved the centralization problems and minimized the high degree of human intervention in the process of traffic signal light management. As a road is congested, the vehicle forwards road condition messages. The traffic department (TD) adjusts the signal light duration to allow the synergistic optimization management, and control the traffic vehicle status through a smart contract. In addition, we propose a credibility mechanism to effectively prevent vehicles from broadcasting mendacious messages and malicious requests, thereby enhancing the credibility of vehicles and providing a secure and trustworthy communication environment for the VANETs. It is hazardous for vehicles to send plaintext messages in an open environment because their privacy and security are threatened. Thus, we utilize ElGamal encryption and group signature algorithm to guarantee the confidentiality, privacy, and non-repudiation of any information. The safety analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the scheme is feasible and valid, and it can facilitate the adaptive control of traffic signal lights.

AB It is common to certify when a file was created in digital investigations, e.g., determining first inventors for patentable ideas in intellectual property systems to resolve disputes. Secure time-stamping schemes can be derived from blockchain-based storage to protect files from backdating/forward-dating, where a file is integrated into a transaction on a blockchain and the timestamp of the corresponding block reflects the latest time the file was created. Nevertheless, blocks' timestamps in blockchains suffer from time errors, which causes the inaccuracy of files' timestamps. In this paper, we propose an accurate blockchain-based time-stamping scheme called Chronos. In Chronos, when a file is created, the file and a sufficient number of successive blocks that are latest confirmed on blockchain are integrated into a transaction. Due to chain quality, it is computationally infeasible to pre-compute these blocks. The time when the last block was chained to the blockchain serves as the earliest creation time of the file. The time when the block including the transaction was chained indicates the latest creation time of the file. Therefore, Chronos makes the file's creation time corresponding to this time interval. Based on chain growth, Chronos derives the time when these two blocks were chained from their heights on the blockchain, which ensures the accuracy of the file's timestamp. The security and performance of Chronos are demonstrated by a comprehensive evaluation.

AB Transactive energy systems (TES) are emerging as a transformative solution for the problems that distribution system operators face due to an increase in the use of distributed energy resources and rapid growth in scalability of managing active distribution system (ADS). On the one hand, these changes pose a decentralized power system control problem, requiring strategic control to maintain reliability and resiliency for the community and for the utility. On the other hand, they require robust financial markets while allowing participation from diverse prosumers. To support the computing and flexibility requirements of TES while preserving privacy and security, distributed software platforms are required. In this paper, we enable the study and analysis of security concerns by developing Transactive Energy Security Simulation Testbed (TESST), a TES testbed for simulating various cyber attacks. In this work, the testbed is used for TES simulation with centralized clearing market, highlighting weaknesses in a centralized system. Additionally, we present a blockchain enabled decentralized market solution supported by distributed computing for TES, which on one hand can alleviate some of the problems that we identify, but on the other hand, may introduce newer issues. Future study of these differing paradigms is necessary and will continue as we develop our security simulation testbed.

AB The past several years have witnessed an explosive growth in cryptocurrencies, but the blockchain-based cryptocurrencies have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even the leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve the cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers the off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of payment routing in PCNs from an optimization perspective, which is to minimize the transaction fee of a payment path, subject to the timeliness and feasibility constraints. We present an optimal distributed algorithm CheaPay for this problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate that CheaPay significantly outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of the success ratio and the average accepted value.

AB This paper is divided in two parts. The first part is the story of a failure, where an attempt to generate verifiable Proof-of-Location from WiFi scan results has failed, even when scan results were compared with a small time shift within the same trace. In the second part, this paper proposes to conduct Proof-of-Location transactions in a peer-to-peer fashion. Each peer is assisted by the cloud side which plays the role of both the real-time mediator and public transaction ledger. This paper proposes the Last Man Standing (LMS) procedure which is both a means for ensuring a fair transaction and a natural way to close it. Each transaction results in a coin which can be either shared among transaction participants or owned individually by LMS. Analysis using real mobility traces from various types of urban locations shows that the proposal is valid and will ensure that all the locations within the city will gradually be claimed via the proposed type of transactions while providing independently verifiable proofs for each location. The distant goal of this paper is a next generation Location-Based Service (LBS) which takes the form of a location-based resource economy where each location is a coin compatible with traditional blockchain operations.

AB With the development of artificial intelligence and self-driving, vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) has become an irreplaceable part of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). However, the traditional network of the ground cannot meet the requirements of transmission, processing, and storage among vehicles. Under this circumstance, integrating space and air nodes into the whole network can provide comprehensive traffic information and reduce the transmission delay. The high mobility and low latency in the Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN) put forward higher requirements for security issues such as identity authentication, privacy protection and data security. This paper simplifies the Blockchain and proposes an identity authentication and privacy protection scheme based on the Hashchain in the SAGIN. The scheme focuses on the characteristics of the wireless signal to identify and authenticate the nodes. The verification and backup of the records on the block are implemented with the distributed streaming platform, Kafka algorithm, instead of the consensus. Furthermore, this paper analyzes the security of this scheme. Afterward, the experimental results reveal the delay brought by the scheme using the simulation of SUMO, OMNeT++, and Veins.

TI Dynamic and Privacy-Preserving Reputation Management for
   Blockchain-Based Mobile Crowdsensing
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is an emerging data collection paradigm that exploits the potential of individual mobile devices to acquire mass data in a cost-effective manner. One of the important challenges in MCS application is to resist malicious users who provide false data to disturb the system. In the existing work, the reputation management scheme is an effective way to overcome the challenge. However, most reputation management schemes rely on a semi-honest server and process data in the plaintext domain without considering server security and user privacy. In this paper, we integrate the blockchain and edge computing in the MCS scenario to construct a credible and efficient blockchain-based MCS system, called BC-MCS. To resist malicious users, we present a privacy-preserving reputation management scheme based on the proposed system. Furthermore, we design a delegation protocol to solve the inherent problem of user dynamics in the MCS. The prototype system implemented on the Hyperledger Sawtooth and Android client demonstrates that our scheme can achieve higher utility and security levels in handling malicious users compared with the previous centralized reputation management schemes.

AB With the development of the autonomous hybrid plug-in electric vehicles (AHEVs), majority of AHEVs are equipped with bidirectional chargers. However, during the energy trading process, the centralized schemes are exposed to many flaws like the high energy transmission loss and cannot resist the single-point failure. Therefore, it is more important to use the decentralized manner to keep the safety energy trading between AHEVs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized energy trading architecture in which AHEVs can broadcast their requirements to neighbors and negotiate with other AHEVs on the transmission parameters without a transaction server. The smart contract (SC) is deployed among RSUs which can be automatically executed after the negotiation process. To promote AHEVs to behave honestly on the road, we associate the trust value of AHEVs with the charging price. We use proof-of-concept to theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of the development of the SC and the security properties of the proposed scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed negotiation scheme outperforms the non-negotiation scheme in the aspect of efficiency.

AB Blockchain is regarded as a revolutionary technology, which is widely used in different fields all over world, especially for the application in energy field. With the development of distributed generation, there's a greater opportunity for distributed generation trading. In the near future, everyone may be able to sell their surplus electricity generated by their rooftop photovoltaic. It can be determined that blockchain can increase the trust between transactors. Blockchain can provide convenience for peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. In addition, blockchain can be used in other energy fields such as IOT, shared EV charging pile and etc. Because of the above advantages, many countries in the world are developing energy blockchain and have built some applied engineering programs. Some representative projects in US are introduced in this paper, and advanced technologies adopted in these existing projects are also analyzed. Finally, suggestions for developing energy blockchain technology and conclusions are given. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Due to the increased popularity of Bitcoin, many researchers have analyzed how Bitcoin is being used based on the transaction history. However, the existing works analyze the transaction history in a "static" manner and none of them analyzes transaction history "dynamically", i.e. without taking into account the "time variation of how Bitcoin is transferred". The time analysis is in great demand for many practical cases, such as digital forensics tool that infers what was going on behind the scene of a fraudulent scam, and real-time inference of marketplace sales. In this paper, we propose a novel time series analysis for analyzing the history of Bitcoin transactions. In fact the main goal of our research is to detect changing points, namely anomaly detection, against a given (Bitcoin) address's transaction history. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is tested against the transaction history of Pirate@40's HYIP (High Yielding Investment Program) scheme, which raised 700,000 BTC from his investors and was charged by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2013. It is shown that the proposed approach can successfully detect several remarkable points of Pirate@40's HYIP scheme, such as when its program's name was changed to Bitcoin Saving & Trust and when its investment rule was changed.

AB In recent years, Bitcoin has been used for many services and purposes, e.g. gambling, marketplace, but also even as an investment scam. In order to clarify how Bitcoin is used, it is in great importance to identify what kind of services are operated by Bitcoin addresses. In this paper, we propose a multi-class service identification scheme in Bitcoin based on novel transaction history summarization. Our novelty is to propose how transaction history is retrieved and how the retrieved transactions are processed for better identification. When a Bitcoin address is given, the characteristics of its transaction history is calculated as features. Then, the set of calculated features is fed into a supervised classifier and the services operated by the given Bitcoin addresses are identified among seven major services: (i) exchange, (ii) faucet, (iii) gambling, (iv) investment scam, (v) marketplace, (vi) mining pool, and (vii) mixer. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a multi-class identification. We show that our scheme achieves 72% of accuracy through performance evaluation with more than 26,000 Bitcoin addresses that have been used for seven services/purposes from Jan. 2009 to Feb. 2017.

AB Bitcoin provides only pseudo-anonymous transactions, which can be exploited to link payers and payees - defeating the goal of anonymous payments. To thwart such attacks, several Bitcoin mixers have been proposed, with the objective of providing unlinkability between payers and payees. However, existing Bitcoin mixers can be regarded as either insecure or inefficient.
   We present OBSCURO, a highly efficient and secure Bitcoin mixer that utilizes trusted execution environments (TEEs). With the TEE's confidentiality and integrity guarantees for code and data, our mixer design ensures the correct mixing operations and the protection of sensitive data (i.e., private keys and mixing logs), ruling out coin theft and address linking attacks by a malicious service provider. Yet, the TEE-based implementation does not prevent the manipulation of inputs (e.g., deposit submissions, blockchain feeds) to the mixer, hence OBSCURO is designed to overcome such limitations: it (1) offers an indirect deposit mechanism to prevent a malicious service provider from rejecting benign user deposits; and (2) scrutinizes blockchain feeds to prevent deposits from being mixed more than once (thus degrading anonymity) while being eclipsed from the main blockchain branch. In addition, OBSCURO provides several unique anonymity features (e.g., minimum mixing set size guarantee, resistant to dropping user deposits) that are not available in existing centralized and decentralized mixers.
   Our prototype of OBSCURO is built using Intel SGX and we demonstrate its effectiveness in Bitcoin Testnet. Our implementation mixes 1000 inputs in just 6.49 seconds, which vastly outperforms all of the existing decentralized mixers.

AB Blockchain technology is already being exploited in various ways for saving cost with high security to create and manage the distributed system as well as to record information about transactions without the verification of the third party. In addition, the issue of counterfeit certification is making education managers around the world a particular interest. It is a serious problem up to now. Therefore, deploying the system to issuing and verifying digital certificate based on blockchain technology will solve the problem of counterfeit certification which there is not any prior technology really address it. In this study, we propose and implement an issuing and verifying model called UniCert based on UniCoin which is a digital currency built on the blockchain technology. Our diagram can be extended to address many other issues such as anti-counterfeiting, copyright protection of music products, patents, etc.

AB Recently digital currency has received significant attention, and among many topics within digital currency, CBDC (Central Bank issued Digital Currency) has been a hot topic as it will affect national currency systems. RSCoin is the first CBDC model sponsored by Bank of England, and it uses the UTXO model from Bitcoin. This paper proposes a new CBDC model Panda model that can store account balance like current banking systems, but use efficient consensus protocols to ensure that relevant parties have consistent views of transactions and accounts. The Panda model is scalable as it can include as many financial institutions or individuals as possible in the system with increasing or decreasing workloads. The model has been simulated in the TaiShan Sandbox in Qingdao.

TI MONEY LAUNDERING AND DISTRIBUTED LEDGER TECHNOLOGY IN HONG KONG
SO HONG KONG LAW JOURNAL
AB Distributed ledger technology (DLT) or "blockchain" has received enormous attention from the finance industry. In general, DLT is a decentralised platform that enables transactions or information to be sent over the Internet from one party to another without the involvement of a central authority. It allows users to securely transact without knowing or trusting their counterparty. While commercially ground breaking, DLT challenges conventional regulation of money laundering and terrorist financing. Recently, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a whitepaper on DLT. The whitepaper states that the anonymity of users and the decentralisation of distributed ledgers could raise the risk of money laundering. It also states that these issues might be effectively addressed through a permissioned distributed ledger where participants are identified and authorised. This article expands on HKMA's suggestion by arguing a "consortium-based" approach because it achieves some of the money-laundering protections required under Hong Kong statutory frameworks, while retaining some of the technology's disruptive characteristics.

AB Most of the cyber information systems require users to provide identity information as a way of authentication and usually the identity information is a pair of username and password. With so many information systems to access, people need to memorize hundreds of usernames and passwords. As a result, they often forget their usernames or passwords and have to go through a time-consuming and troublesome procedure to find them back. In this article, we propose a solution storing people's usernames and passwords using block-chain in an encrypted format. When the username or password for a particular website is lost, they can be accessible through the block-chain. As a result, people do not need to memorize their usernames and passwords for different websites anymore. The password stored in the block-chain would not be compromised to any cyber-attacks because block-chain is immutable.

AB The aim of the proposed work is to introduce a secure and interoperable Demand Response (DR) management platform that will assist Aggregators (or other relevant Stakeholders involved in DR business scenarios) in their decision making mechanisms over their portfolios of prosumers. This novel architecture incorporates multiple strategies and policies provided from energy market stakeholders, establishing a more modular and future-proof DR solution. By employing an innovative multi-agent decision making system and self-learning algorithms to enable aggregation, segmentation and coordination of several diverse clusters, consisting of supply and demand assets, a fully autonomous design will be delivered. This DR framework is further fortified in terms of data security by not only implementing cutting-edge blockchain infrastructure, but also by making use of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications (dApps) which will further secure and facilitate Aggregators-to-Prosumers transactions. The blockchain technologies will be combined with well-known open protocols (i.e. OpenADR) towards also supporting interoperability in terms of information exchange.

AB Cryptocurrencies prices forecasting is a complex theme due to the chaotic market behavior and the influence of external events. Therefore, inference models should offer, in addition to a satisfying accuracy, reasonable interpretability, so that investors can decide based on their own knowledge. However, many studies in this subject focus on model accuracy and leave much to be desired in terms of simplicity and interpretability. This work proposes the use of Mamdani interpretable fuzzy inference models for forecasting cryptocurrency price variation. For that, a genetic algorithm to optimize models accuracy is employed, limiting the quantity of rules and antecedents arbitrarily. A set of infeasible rules had to be discarded, in order to generate interesting models, that produce a relevant amount of trades. Data from Kraken exchange were utilized for training, validation and results assessment. Results have shown that, for the cryptocurrencies with the highest validation performances, there are gains in comparison to the simple currency appreciation. Using the interpretable aspect of the models, it should be possible to obtain even higher profits.

AB Healthcare directories are vital for interoperability among healthcare providers, researchers and patients. Past efforts at directory services have not provided the tools to allow integration of the diverse data sources. Many are overly strict, incompatible with legacy databases, and do not provide Data Provenance. A more architecture-independent system is needed to enable secure, GDPR-compatible (8) service discovery across organizational boundaries. We review our development of a portable Data Provenance Toolkit supporting provenance within Health Information Exchange (HIE) systems. The Toolkit has been integrated with client software and successfully leveraged in clinical data integration. The Toolkit validates provenance stored in a Blockchain or Directory record and creates provenance signatures, providing standardized provenance that moves with the data. This healthcare directory suite implements discovery of healthcare data by HIE and EHR systems via FHIR. Shortcomings of past directory efforts include the ability to map complex datasets and enabling interoperability via exchange endpoint discovery. By delivering data without dictating how it is stored we improve exchange and facilitate discovery on a multi-national level through open source, fully interoperable tools. With the development of Data Provenance resources we enhance exchange and improve security and usability throughout the health data continuum.

AB With the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, it can collect and store various types of data in the cloud everyday. However, since the vast amount of data collected by IoT devices is very closely related to individuals, careful management of this data is required. Previously, we proposed a control mechanism for live migration with data regulations preservation that solved the problem of unintentional and inappropriate movement of data due to Virtual Machine (VM) migration on the cloud. However, if the license information of the country or organization used in the proposed method has been tampered with malicious intent, there's a possibility that inappropriate data movement will occur. In this paper, we proposed an improved data protection mechanism that can prevent malicious tampering during VM migration on the cloud using blockchain technology. Initial experimental results shows that the proposed mechanism incurs minute overhead and almost no influence on the migration processing time. Consequently, this will support reliable compliance of the conditions licensed by the owner of the data, the laws of the country, and the regulations of the organization.

AB The application and use of smart contracts in organizations require a holistic overview. This overview helps to understand the current adoption of this technology and also deduces factors that are inhibiting its use in the modern organization. This study provides a systematic review of previous studies comprising of frameworks, methods, working prototypes and simulations that demonstrate the application of smart contracts in organizations. Understanding the current state and usage of smart-contract technology in an organization is a focal point of this paper. Much progress occurs in developing technologies that support smart contracts, while little understanding exists pertaining to their usage in organizations. In this study, we identify properties of smart-contract applications in different domains of modern organizations. We further analyze and categorize challenges and problems mitigating the adoption of smart-contract applications.

AB Cloud services operate in a highly dynamic environment. This means that they need to be assorted with dynamic SLAs which explicate how a rich set of QoS guarantees evolves over time. Only in this way, cloud users will trust and thus migrate their processes to the cloud. Research-wise, SLAs are assumed to include single states while they are managed mainly in a centralised manner. This paper proposes a framework to manage dynamic SLAs in a distributed manner by relying on a rich and dynamic SLA formalism which is transformed into a smart contract. This contract is then handled via the blockchain which exploits an oracle-based interface to retrieve the off-chain cloud service context sensed and enforce the right SLA management/modification functions. The proposed framework can change the current shape of the cloud market by catering for the notion of an open distributed cloud which offers manageable and dynamic services to cloud customers enabling them to reduce costs and increase the flexibility in resource management.

AB The Blockchain is an emerging paradigm that could solve security and trust issues for Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. We recently introduced in an IETF draft ("Blockchain Transaction Protocol for Constraint Nodes") the BIoT paradigm, whose main idea is to insert sensor data in blockchain transactions. Because objects are not logically connected to blockchain platforms, controller entities forward all information needed for transaction forgery. Never less in order to generate cryptographic signatures, object needs some trusted computing resources. In previous papers we proposed the Four-Quater Architecture integrating general purpose unit (GPU), radio SoC, sensors/actuators and secure elements including TLS/DTLS stacks. These secure microcontrollers also manage crypto libraries required for blockchain operation. The BIoT concept has four main benefits: publication/duplication of sensors data in public and distributed ledgers, time stamping by the blockchain infrastructure, data authentication, and non repudiation.

AB As more and more distributed renewable energy resources are integrated to the grid, the traditional consumers have become the prosumers who can sell back their surplus energy to the others who are in energy shortage. This peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transaction framework benefits the end users, financially and in term of energy security; and the network operators, in term of flexibility in DRES management, peak load shifting and regulation of voltage/frequency. Environmentally, P2P energy transaction also helps to reduce carbon footprint, reduces DRES payback period and incentivizes the installation of DRES. The current centralized market model is no longer suitable and it is therefore necessary to develop an adapted decentralized architecture for the advanced P2P energy transaction framework intra/intermicrogrid. In this paper, we discuss several distributed ledger approaches for such framework: Blockchain, Block Lattice and Directed Acyclic Graph (the Tangle). The technical advantages of these architectures as well as the persistent challenges are then considered.

AB In this paper, we propose novel mathematical models for effectively choosing a set of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) in transaction-based blockchains in terms of two major objectives. The first one is to minimize the transaction size, as a result, minimize the transaction fee for miners paid by users. The second one is to shrink the UTXO set size that consequently reduces the searching space and computation overhead. Our proposed models are evaluated on real transactions collected from Bitcoin network and transactions generated by Highest Value First (HVF) and Lowest Value First (LVF) based approaches. The experimental results show that our proposed models gain better performance compared to other existing approaches.

AB Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology are used to improve the traditional companies. One type of traditional companies is insurance companies. These companies suffer several problems that are leading to decrease their efficiency in modern societies. Many users of these companies are unhappy and dissatisfied because of some problems. The main problems of these companies are that their operations are not transparent. Moreover, their insurance rates are not calculated and in adaptive with customer's characteristics, e.g for low-risk and high-risk customers. Note that, users are not identical to the same insurance rates, which are determined by the insurer. In modern society, we have the IoT technology that enables us to find some specific information about users. This information enables the insurance companies to increase its accuracy. In addition, considering the potential of the smart contract of the blockchain, determining insurance rates must be transparent. This article proposes a self-organizing framework for insurance based on IoT and blockchain, which eliminates the main problems of traditional insurance. To evaluate the proposed framework, it is compared with the existing framework. The results show that it has several advantages over the existing framework and could be useful in near future.

AB A decentralized ride-or carsharing application is among the early proposals of what smart contracts on blockchains may enable in the future. To facilitate use cases in the field of location-based services (LBS), smart contracts need to receive trustworthy positioning information, and be able to process them. We propose an approach on how geofences can be defined in smart contracts, and how supplied positions can be evaluated on whether they are contained in the geofence or not. The approach relies on existing location encoding systems like Geohashes and S2 cells that can transform polygons into a grid of cells. These can be stored in a smart contract to represent a geofence. An oracle run by a mobile network provider can submit network-based positioning information to the contract, that compares it with the geofence. We evaluate the location encoding systems on their ability to model city geofences and mobile network cell position estimates and analyze the costs associated with storing and evaluating received oracle-positions in an Ethereum-based smart contract implementation. Our results show that S2 encodings perform better than Geohashes, that the one-time cost of geofence definition corresponds linearly with the number of grid cells used, and that the evaluation of oracle-submitted locations does not incur high costs.

AB The recent advancement in Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum has captured interest of many researchers in academia and industry. Since its advent, the Blockchain was inherently supposed to be used in combination with cryptocurrencies but currently this technology is being used in other areas as well. One particular area based on the distributed ledger technology that has grabbed the attention of many technologist and financial marketers is "Smart Contracts". Based on a cryptocurrency framework known as Ethereum, these smart contracts can be used for different applications such as Option Pricing, Currency Exchange, Revenue Management System, Crowd-funding and Peer-to-Peer networking. In our current effort, we have designed a smart contract and demonstrate that this smart contract could be used to take various possible positions in an European style option. We have analyzed the contract for potential security vulnerabilities when implemented in Blockchain. These option based smart contracts could be used for collateral contract services among finance industries.

AB In the present era of smart cities and homes, the private information of the patients such as their names, address, and disease is being breached on a regular basis, which indirectly related to the security of electronic health records (EHRs). The existing state-of-the-art schemes handling the security of EHRs have resulted in data being generally inaccessible to patients. These schemes struggle in providing the efficient balance between the data privacy, need for patients, and providers to regularly interact with data. Blockchain technology resolves the aforementioned issues because it shares the data in a decentralized and transactional fashion. This can be leveraged in the healthcare sector to maintain the balance between privacy and accessibility of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based framework for efficient storage and maintenance of EHRs. This further provides the secure and efficient access to medical data by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the patient private information. The goals of this paper are to analyze how our proposed framework fulfills the needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework maintains the privacy and security concerns in the healthcare 4.0.

AB In distributed high-performance systems that allow processing large data sets, the important task is the analysis and verification of the video data. The problem of confirming data is relevant for many areas. The need for this arises when fixing offences, banking, remote management, confirmation of actions, etc. In this paper, we describe an approach to verifying video received by a mobile device like mobile phone, tablet or PC, equipped with a camera and controlled by the operating system (Windows, Android or iOS). The proposed algorithm uses the procedure of entering the Swype code using the movement mobile camera. To improving the accuracy, we use additional information from different mobile sensors like accelerometer, gyro, barometer, and GPS. In the process of data verification, video transmission to the server is not perform what ensures the privacy of the captured video data. The server and mobile device stores data about the file size, the date of its recording, the time, the data device and its position.

AB Usage-based Insurance (UBI) for vehicles determines the insurance premiums according to actual usage and driving pattern. It can significantly reduce insurance costs for safe drivers, however, UBI schemes require detailed driving data to determine the insurance premiums, which may lead to serious privacy breach for drivers. Moreover, most existing UBI schemes require a centralized insurance company as the intermediary to manage insurances. Such a centralized solution incurs too much monetary costs as well as time cost. In this paper, we propose PRIDE, a privacy-preserving and decentralized UBI scheme using the blockchain to record encrypted driving data, and the smart contract running on the blockchain to calculate insurance premiums. Different from existing UBI schemes, PRIDE achieves security and privacy without relying on any centralized party or any trusted/tamper-proof hardware. We have analyzed security of PRIDE and evaluated its performance. The results show that PRIDE is very efficient in processing UBI insurances-each insurance request can be processed in about 898ms.

AB The application of mu MPMU in the fault diagnosis of distribution network is increasingly widespread. In addition to the waveform data of the mu MPMUs near the fault point, some existing fault diagnosis algorithms require the waveform of mu MPMU at other locations. However, the mu MPMU measurement signal far from the fault location may not reach the trigger recording condition. Aiming at the difficulty of cooperative fault recording of mu MPMU, this paper proposes a new collaborative trigger recording scheme based on blockchain. In this scheme, every mu MPMU acts as a node and a blockchain network is constructed. The smart contract is used to stipulate the rule of coordinated trigger recording. The mu MPMUs that spontaneously start the recording inform others to perform coordinated fault recording, and the waveform data are stored in a blockchain structure for the master station summoning. In this paper, the pros and cons of the blockchain-based scheme and the existing master station based coordinated fault recording scheme are analyzed, which provides a new research approach for the coordinated start-up of mu MPMU fault recording in the distribution network.

AB Blockchain is one of the most heavily invested technologies in recent years. Due to its tamper-proof and decentralization properties, blockchain has become an ideal utility for data storage that is applicable in many real world industrial scenarios. One important scenario is web log, which is treated as sources of technical significance and commercial revenues in major internet companies. In this paper, we illustrate our design of a web log storage system based on HyperLedger. HyperLedger yields higher throughput and lower latency compared with other blockchain systems. Alongside its efficiency advantages., HyperLeger is a permissioned blockchain, which is an ideal fit for enterprise software design scenario.

TI Will Innovative Technology Result in Innovative Legal Frameworks? -
   Smart Contracts in China
SO EUROPEAN REVIEW OF PRIVATE LAW
AB This article explores whether the legal landscape will be fundamentally changed in view of the emergence of smart contracts in China. Beyond the phenomenon of bitcoin supported by blockchain technology, we examine the development of smart contracts on blockchain with a close scrutiny of their merits and limits, and the intrinsic legal uncertainties in their application. The main argument is that while the gaps between the regulatory framework and the business practice can be identified, for most parts, the current legal framework can accommodate or mitigate the legal risks brought about by smart contracts.

AB This paper proposed a decentralized electricity transactions mode of microgrid based on blockchain and continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism. The buyer and seller shall first complete the transaction matching in CDA market. Considering the frequent price fluctuation in CDA market, this paper proposed the adaptive aggressiveness strategy, which enables the trader to adjust the quotation timely according to the market changes. Then DG and consumer exchange digital certificate of power and expenditure on the blockchain system, and the consumers' interests are guaranteed by multi-signature when DG cannot generate power due to failure or other reasons. Digital certification of electricity assets is replaced by the sequence number with specific tags in the transaction script, and the size of digital certification can be adjusted according to transaction energy quantity. Finally, the feasibility of proposed mode through a microgrid case and settlement process is given.

AB A review system is a valuable component in E-commerce applications. Existing centralized review systems are prone to review frauds and manipulations. A decentralized, immutable and auditable blockchain system is a natural fit to prevent fraudulent and manipulated reviews. We develop and implement ReviewChain, a decentralized review system using Ethereum smart contract. ReviewChain validates new reviews by querying the identity of purchasers from a supply chain system. We assume that the supply chain system is based on blockchain technology. We develop and implement a mechanism to tie two disparate Ethereum based blockchain networks. Ethereum smart contract code is limited and cannot make external procedure calls. Therefore, we introduce multi-blockchain gateway nodes called notaries. Our proposed smart contracts and notaries allow us to interface two blockchains effectively. We run ReviewChain and discuss how various design parameters impact the system performance.

AB Crowdsourcing relies on people's contributions to meet product-or system-level objectives. Crowdsourcing-based methods have been implemented in various cyber-physical systems and realtime markets. This paper explores a framework for Crowdsourced Energy Systems (CES), where small-scale energy generation or energy trading is crowdsourced from distributed energy resources, electric vehicles, and shapable loads. The merits/ pillars of energy crowdsourcing are discussed. Then, an operational model for CESs in distribution networks with different types of crowdsourcees is proposed. The model yields a market equilibrium depicting traditional and distributed generator and load setpoints. Given these setpoints, crowdsourcing incentives are designed to steer crowdsourcees to the equilibrium. As the number of crowdsourcees and energy trading transactions scales up, a secure energy trading platform is required. To that end, the presented framework is integrated with a lightweight Blockchain implementation and smart contracts. Numerical tests are provided to showcase the overall implementation.

AB The study integrates blockchain technology which treats each mobile database as a block Each block will first detect its own range of sensor data. The system then concatenates the sensor data for each block through the blockchain technology. In addition to their own measurement data, these concatenated sensor data also contain all the sensor data of the previous block Therefore, when the system completes the connection of each block, each block node stores the sensor data of the entire wireless network Mobile database is placed in an embedded hardware module like the Raspberry Pi. This module also establishes web server at the same time. The setting of this mobile web server is based on the Web of Things (WoT) structure. The advantage of this mobile database is easy information collection, while maintaining confidentiality and security. This mobile web server can draw figures with multiple chart types on the web page whilst delivering these web pages of charts to the cloud. The mobile web server is also built on the same embedded hardware module, and even the system can be a private cloud data center. The proposed system will visualize the data uploaded by these sensors and draw the relevant chart after performing big data analysis. This web page server of the system is built on an embedded operating system so that it is easy for the system to model and visualize the corresponding graphics using the Python or JavaScript programming language.

AB Traditional machine learning algorithms use data from databases that are mutable, and therefore the data cannot be fully trusted. Also, the machine learning process is difficult to automate. This paper proposes building a trustable machine learning system by using blockchain technology, which can store data in a permanent and immutable way. In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.

According to the score-pricing strategy we will introduce later, this incentive method can ameliorate the problem of too concentrated bookkeeping permissions and improve the initiative of the accounting node.

AB As a global decentralized distributed ledger, Bitcoin's POW mechanism is so complex that the transaction's confirmation is very time-consuming. If the dust attacks occur in the blockchain, which sends large amounts of dust transactions to the blockchain, the time of transactions' confirmation will be more longer, which will lead to more security problems, such as double-spending or blockchain forks. In order to identify and prevent dust attacks, this paper proposes an innovative Anti-Dust security model, which analyzes the characteristics of dust attacks and learns from the historical transactions big data, uses the Gaussian distribution to construct a dust recognition algorithm. At the same time, a dust transaction pool will be added to improve the blockchain architecture. In the experiment, a large amount of dust transactions will be send to the blockchain. Taking 50000 dust attacks and 500 normal transactions as an example, the conformation time of blockchain without Anti-Dust is about 20000 seconds, and Anti-Dust is about 210 seconds. The results show that Anti-Dust is an effective defense method to identify and prevent the dust attacks.

AB The blockchain architecture with distributed and decentralized as the main features often face problems such as long transaction confirmation time, low system throughput, and waste of computing resources. These problems are exactly what the traditional centralized architecture can solve. At the same time, in order to improve the distributed consensus efficiency, consensus algorithms such as Proof of stake, delegated proof of stake, proof of space, proof of authority, and PBFT have emerged from Bitcoin's Pow consensus mechanism. These consensus algorithms have their own advantages and Disadvantages. Disadvantages, such as Pos, DPos can improve transaction efficiency, PBFT can improve the fairness of voting, but at the same time POS also bring benefits and voting rights to hold a lot of user tilt issues to a small number of tokens, PBFT brings about a low cost of malicious user attacks and other issues. In order to effectively take advantage of the high security, high reliability of the blockchain, and high efficiency of traditional centralized architectures, and fully utilizing existing consensus mechanisms, this paper presents an innovative hybrid blockchain approach, which mixed the blockchain architecture, Hybrid-chain, consists of the following three type nodes in the architecture: service center nodes responsible for efficient transaction confirmation, dynamic transaction verification nodes participating in transactions, and random verification nodes responsible for transaction fairness verification. On the consensus mechanism, the consensus algorithm selects the corresponding consensus mechanism according to the transaction characteristics. Experiments show that compared with the traditional blockchain architecture, hybrid chain has obvious performance advantages in transaction sending, transaction confirmation and block information storage, which can greatly reduce the transaction sending time by 96%, shorten the confirmation time by 95%, and reduce the number of 79. % Block information storage space, etc.

Nevertheless, the according application is constrained due to its limitations in scalability. In this paper, we proposed a highly scalable consensus model based on majority voting cellular automata, namely the MOCA consensus, with a distinctive blockchain-based distributed ledger in which the state change of each node depends on its neighbors. MOCA consensus origins from the zero-temperature Ising model with spontaneous magnetization achieving scalability of number of nodes with high probability Byzantine fault tolerance.

This structure separated the original data storage and data transactions. Secondly, combined with proxy reencryption technology, safe and reliable data sharing were achieved. Finally, a new design was implemented. The logical structure of data transaction records enables data to be traced. The results of correctness and security analysis showed that this scheme can provide new technical ideas and methods for big data sharing and data trace.

AB The immense promise of reinventing business processes has led to the development of alternative blockchain technologies, such as consortium blockchain, that can deal with some of the issues of public blockchains such as used in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. However, a consortium blockchain, where its tokens have no market value, suffers from a lack of a method for payment for services, since the authority is concentrated with the entities that secure payment. Here, we describe Niji, a new cross-chain payment protocol that allows parties to perform Bitcoin payment securely on a consortium chain, without any trusted third-party or mediator. Niji introduces templatization of a transaction to validate Bitcoin payments efficiently on different consortium blockchains. The process from payment to service provision runs autonomously without any interaction between parties. An experiment measuring the computational cost and latency demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of our implementation.

AB For decades it has been acknowledged that sharing security information and collaboration between security practitioners are a necessity. Yet, effective sharing and collaboration are rare. A gamut of legislative acts, executive orders, academic works, and private sector initiatives have discussed aspects of the problem and aimed to be the catalyst needed to fix the situation. But almost 30 years since these efforts started, the state of sharing and collaboration is still technically complicated, slow, untrusted, and impeded by bureaucratic woes.
   This work identifies the challenges of sharing security artifacts and uses real-world examples to illustrate our findings. Based on this knowledge, we propose a new model for sharing and collaboration, CARE. The CARE architecture eases many of the privacy, secrecy, lineage, and structure issues that plague current sharing communities and platforms. We then build upon this foundation to introduce a marketplace based on smart contracts with transactional privacy over a distributed blockchain. Therefore, CARE incentivizes sharing, combats free riding, and provides an immutable ledger for the attribution of events. This paradigm shift, overcomes the challenges of sharing while providing new opportunities for business models, insurance risk assessments, and government backed incentivisation.

AB Healthcare-related technology has been growing exponentially, from electronic healthcare records (EHRs) and personal health trackers to population health management tools. Currently, data from these sources is largely archived, analyzed separately or using only cursory integration with other data sources. In this study, we propose a coupled AI-Blockchain EHR management system. The goal is to provide a platform that leverages blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) for (i) secure EHR management, (ii) efficient data integration, and (iii) reliable computer-aided diagnoses. A goal-oriented modeling approach with the Constrained Goal Model (CGM) is used to elicit the system requirements. Questionnaire results for a case study in Abu Dhabi, UAE served for model validation and refinement for maximizing the number of system users.

AB The decentralization and intelligence of block chain technology are consistent with the concept of personal information protection. The industry generally believes that its application in personal information protection will effectively support the development of multiple types of personal information systems and the extensive participation of multiple users. This paper analyzes the application of personal information protection to block chain application based on the actual technical requirements and application requirements of personal information protection. Aiming at the problems of information security such as loss of private key and disclosure of privacy, the corresponding countermeasures are proposed. Finally, this paper interprets the application of current block chain in personal information protection.

AB DLT suggests a new way to implement the Accounting Information System, but after reviewing the current literature our conclusion is that an ontologically sound consensus-based design is missing to date. Against this research gap, the paper introduces a DLT-based shared ledger solution in a formal way and compliant with Financial Reporting Standards. We build on the COFRIS accounting ontology (grounded in UFO-S) and the blockchain ontology developed by De Kruijff & Weigand that distinguishes between a Data-logical level, an Infological and an Essential (conceptual) level. It is shown how consensual and agent-specific parts of the business exchange transaction can be represented in a concise way, and how this pattern can be implemented using Smart Contracts.

AB This research addresses the issue that in-depth programming knowhow is needed to read and write smart contracts. The goal was making the creation of smart contracts accessible to non-computer experts by the use of a graphical programming language (Blockly). We used modularization to capture the complexity of legal contracts and developed a mapping process to transform the graphical representation to the smart contract programming language Solidity. We applied our approach to legal purchase agreements and proved the practicality of our solution and explored its limitations. A prototype was built to show the feasibility of our approach. Our industry partner challenged the prototype by applying it to the contract creation process. We consider our work as the first step towards an application of smart contracts in the non-IT world and outside the today's expert shaped ecosystem of blockchain specialists. Several continuative research questions have been derived from our finding and are listed at the end of this paper.

AB In order to explore the virtual currency supervision and compare the differences of it in different countries, taking bitcoin as an example, first of all, the measurements for supervising bitcoin are compared between China and America. In addition, the causes for the difference are further analyzed from social nature, Internet financial mode, and bitcoin industry. Based on this, the countermeasures for China to strengthen bitcoin supervision are put forward. The results showed that the factors for different supervision ideas are various. For the macro level, it includes social system; and for the micro level, it involves consumer's consumption concept. As a result, it is concluded that it is necessary to fully combine with the national conditions and efficiently absorb advanced concept when learning and studying supervision systems with Chinese characteristics.

AB Growing consumer awareness as well as manufacturers' internal quality requirements lead to novel demands on supply chain traceability. Existing centralized solutions suffer from isolated data storage and lacking trust when multiple parties are involved. Decentralized blockchain-based approaches attempt to overcome these shortcomings by creating digital representations of physical goods to facilitate tracking across multiple entities. However, they currently do not capture the transformation of goods in manufacturing processes. Therefore, the relation between ingredients and product is lost, limiting the ability to trace a product's provenance. We propose a blockchain-based supply chain traceability system using smart contracts. In such contracts, manufacturers define the composition of products in the form of recipes. Each ingredient of the recipe is a nonfungible token that corresponds to a batch of physical goods. When the recipe is applied, its ingredients are consumed and a new token is produced. This mechanism preserves the traceability of product transformations. The system is implemented for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is applicable to any blockchain configuration that supports it. Our evaluation reveals that the gas costs scale linearly with the number of products considered in the system. This leads to the conclusion that the solution can handle complex use cases.

AB This review focuses on the evolution of cloud computing and distributed ledger technologies (blockchains) over the last decade. Cloud computing relies mainly on a conceptually centralized service provisioning model, while blockchain technologies originate from a peer-to-peer and a completely distributed approach. Still, noteworthy commonalities between both approaches are often overlooked by researchers. Therefore, to the best of the authors knowledge, this paper reviews both domains in parallel for the first time. We conclude that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The advantages of centralized service provisioning approaches are often the disadvantages of distributed ledger approaches and vice versa. It is obviously an interesting question whether both approaches could be combined in a way that the advantages can be added while the disadvantages could be avoided. We derive a software stack that could build the foundation unifying the best of these two worlds and that would avoid existing shortcomings like vendor lock-in, some security problems, and inherent platform dependencies.

TI Artist as Owner Not Guarantor: The Art Market from the Artist's Point of
   View
SO VISUAL RESOURCES
AB The events of 2016 in which the painter Peter Doig (b. 1959) was sued in US Federal Court for failing to authenticate an artwork for a speculative investor encapsulate a view of the art world from the perspective of collectors and not artists. This paper imagines what would happen if artists were to retain 10% equity in their work in the primary market, rather than receive resale royalties in the secondary market. This idea applies the Coase Theorem in economics, concerning the relationship of property rights, pricing, and trade. Accordingly, those equity shares could trade in a standalone marketplace well before an artwork was sold, providing patronage for artists and more diversifiable art fund structures for investors. Technological systems such as the blockchain (e.g. bitcoin) make such a system timely, by providing cheap accounting and automatic provenance. This proposal stands in stark contrast to much of the writing on resale royalties, which treats payments to artists as welfare or subsidy, or emphasizes a lack of enforceability. In fact, assigning equity shares to artists allows them to participate more accurately, from a free-market-economics standpoint, in the value that their work creates. This realignment of price and value could radically alter and also stabilize the art market in relation to both recent financial crises and the increasing financialization of art objects. Such a system has broad applications to the alignment of price and value in many other sectors of creative work, and beyond.

AB Internet of Things devices is more common and the growth of LPWA (Low Power Wide Area) technology is unavoidable. However, the regulation for this kind of technology is lack behind even though there will be multiple licensing and certification from national regulator and from industry. It will not easy to maintain and check the device's licensing for user and regulator, moreover if the product already had another type of licensing from abroad. It often happens that the vendor files a fake license claims of his products to fulfill the procurement. Therefore, licensing management is required for everyone goodness in the IoT industry. Blockchain implementation assessment framework can be used for assessing this case.

AB Structural changes in the world economy require a constant increase in investment flows. The main factor that determines the presence or absence of resources to finance investment processes is the amount of money in circulation. In this regard, in recent decades, the world financial system has been increasingly faced with the issue of the money supply increase. The process of increasing the currency in circulation should not get out of control; it has to satisfy the needs of world economy sustainable development and at the same time ensure the stability of the international financial markets functioning. Thus, today the issue of finding an international payment facility that would ensure the sustainable development of the world economy on the basis of a controlled growth of the money supply in circulation is an acute one. The way to solve the problem of the money in circulation optimization can be found in so-called cryptographic currencies, the leader among which nowadays is Bitcoin.
   The purpose of this study is to find the answer to the question: "Can Bitcoin's usage as an international means of payment be a way to solve the issue of the money in circulation optimization in order to maintain sustainable development of the world economy?" The study is based on an analysis of the statistical data available at The World Bank, Blockchain Luxembourg SA, MS Brokers Europe Limited. The methodology of the analysis is based on the use of descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, comparative and trend analysis elements.

AB The realm of cryptocurrency has grown exponentially over the past decade, with the most rapid advances seen in the past few years as more and more parties around the world recognize the value of holding digital assets online. Statistics from Twitter support this statement where, approximately 1,500 Tweets about Bitcoin alone is recorded per hour. Consequently, many people are beginning to become more aware and accepting of the nature of digital currencies, and traders in particular seek to know how they can make profitable crypto-coin trades and investments. Although a number of research projects have been undertaken to develop systems that can effectively predict price movements in the cryptocurrency market, they display significant efficiency gaps, which this paper further explores. The authors then attempt to learn from past studies and construct a more holistic approach to a predictive price model for the cryptocurrency market. This focuses on assessing key factors that affect the volatility of the market public perception, trading data, historic price data, and the interdependencies between Bitcoin and Altcoins- and how they can be best utilized from a technological aspect by applying sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques, to increase the efficiency of the process.

AB The idea to digitally facilitate contract law and business practices through computer programs has led to the notion of smart contracts. Today's most prominent smart contract ecosystem is Ethereum, a blockchain based distributed computing platform. Due to the inherent nature of blockchain based contract execution, missing low level programming abstractions, and the constant evolution of platform features and security considerations, writing correct and secure smart contracts for Ethereum is a difficult task. Based on a Multivocal Literature Research and an analysis of the gathered data based on qualitative research methods, we mined a number of design patterns providing design guidelines. We describe those patterns in detail and provide exemplary code for better illustration. Our research shows that the patterns are widely used to address application requirements and common problems. We expect generalizability of some or all of the patterns for other smart contract ecosystems, but this is outside of the scope of this study, which studied only smart contract patterns in Ethereum.

TI Privacy-Enhancing Trust Infrastructure for Process Mining
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON FUNDAMENTALS OF ELECTRONICS COMMUNICATIONS AND
   COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB Threats to a society and its social infrastructure are inevitable and endanger human life and welfare. Resilience is a core concept to cope with such threats in strengthening risk management. A resilient system adapts to an incident in a timely manner before it would result in a failure. This paper discusses the secondary use of personal data as a key element in such conditions and the relevant process mining in order to reduce IT risk on safety. It realizes completeness for such a proof on data breach in an acceptable manner to mitigate the usability problem of soundness for resilience. Acceptable soundness is still required and realized in our scheme for a fundamental privacy-enhancing trust infrastructure. Our proposal achieves an IT baseline protection and properly treats personal data on security as Ground Truth for deriving acceptable statements on data breach. An important role plays reliable broadcast by means of the block chain. This approaches a personal IT risk management with privacy-enhancing cryptographic mechanisms and Open Data without trust as belief in a single-point-of-failure. Instead it strengthens communities of trust.

AB In many envisioned IoT applications, security is crucial. However, designing and/or deploying existing security techniques in IoT systems is not straightforward due to the inherent heterogeneity of IoT devices as well as their huge number. A critical security building block is represented by the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) relying on Certificate Authorities (CAs). However, even a single-point-of-failure in a PKI may affect entire IoT systems due to its centralized nature. Failures have far reaching effects as the number of IoT devices increases. Furthermore, it is difficult for the owners of IoT devices to manage the certificates for their IoT devices since there are no standard protocols for retrieving, installing and updating the certificates. As a result, IoT device manufacturers often install certificates on the devices on behalf of the owners of the devices, which introduces the risk that the private keys of the devices are leaked by the manufacturers. In this paper, we propose a decentralized PKI for IoT, called IoT-PKI, which utilizes distributed nodes in a blockchain network instead of CAs, and thus addresses scalability. IoT-PKI protects against key leakages at device manufacturers since it allows the owners of IoT devices to manage the certificates of their IoT devices. Finally, we show the feasibility and efficiency of IoT-PKI through our prototype implementation and experiments.

AB Current blockchains often are designed with one use case in mind, such as currency transfer in Bitcoin or record storage in Namecoin. While application-specific blockchains are powerful tools for fulfilling their niche use cases, there are blockchains like Ethereum that have a set of use cases comprising a superset of the use cases of many blockchains. These generalized blockchains are powerful tools for extending decentralization to new use cases without designing entirely new blockchains.
   This paper considers tradeoffs in the design and implementation of blockchain systems that intend to deliver general functionality and examines various current and Merged-mining, fragmentation, the network effect, scalability, and generalized blockchain approaches are all considered and put into context. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Rootstock are considered in various aspects of the current limitations, and potential future solutions to problems noted.
   This paper weighs the chances of success of various generalized blockchain paradigms, including the network effect scalability and potential client-side use. We conclude that the network effect likely favors a Bitcoin/sidechain solution while scalability favors a direct Ethereum solution. The likelihood of success of mainstream adoption of any single decentralized application appears to favor an Ethereum solution.

AB Information technology disciplines make up a significant proportion of the degrees taken by international students at Australian universities. These programs are primarily delivered on-campus, but are increasingly using e-learning techniques and becoming, in effect, blended. This provides the opportunity to offer international students part of their program by distance education before, or instead of, traveling to Australia. This could complement the campus-based education provided and complement initiatives by China, Australia, Japan and the United States for regional development. However, Australian university academics have little background or training in e-learning and program designs have not made use of the flexibility this provides. In this paper, we discuss how computer professionals can be trained online to deliver online training to students of the Indo-Pacific. The application of learning theory to support distance learners is also discussed in this paper.

AB Edge computing has emerged as an effective offloading strategy for constrained devices. It enables low-capability devices to leverage nearby resources for assistance with computationally-intensive tasks. We envision a future where Internet of Things (IoT) devices may autonomously transact with other more powerful devices to request such offloading services. We believe blockchain-based technologies can help facilitate this process by tracking usage and managing payments. In this work we introduce SmartEdge, an Ethereum-based smart contract for edge computing and show that it is a low-cost, low-overhead tool for compute-resource management.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) has already been in the period of rapid development and widespread deployment, while it is still vulnerable to various malicious attacks. Security detection before system installation is not enough to ensure that IoT devices are always secure, because newly emerging vulnerabilities can still be exploited to launch attacks. To address this issue, retrospective detection is often required to trace the security status of IoT systems. Unfortunately, existing centralized detection mechanisms cannot easily provide a comprehensive security analysis. In particular, consumers cannot automatically receive security notification whenever a new vulnerability is uncovered. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-powered incentive platform, called SmartRetro, that can incentivize and attract more distributed detectors to participate in retrospective vulnerability detection and contribute their detection results. Leveraging smart contracts, consumers in SmartRetro receive automatic security feedback about their installed IoT systems. We perform the security and theoretical analysis to demonstrate that SmartRetro achieves our desirable security goals. We further implement SmartRetro prototype on Ethereum to evaluate its performance. Our experimental results show SmartRetro is technically feasible and economically beneficial.

AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a state-of-the-art sequence learning in deep learning for time series forecasting. However, less study applied to financial time series forecasting especially in cryptocurrency prediction. Therefore, we propose a new forecasting framework with LSTM model to forecasting bitcoin daily price with two various LSTM models (conventional LSTM model and LSTM with AR(2) model). The performance of the proposed models are evaluated using daily bitcoin price data during 2018/1/1 to 2018/7/28 in total 208 records. The results confirmed the excellent forecasting accuracy of the proposed model with AR(2). The test mean squared error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute error (MAE) for bitcoin price prediction, respectively. The our proposed LSTM with AR(2) model outperformed than conventional LSTM model. The contribution of this study is providing a new forecasting framework for bitcoin price prediction can overcome and improve the problem of input variables selection in LSTM without strict assumptions of data assumption. The results revealed its possible applicability in various cryptocurrencies prediction, industry instances such as medical data or financial time-series data.

AB As technology advances, many countries have now opted for electronic voting systems. Any voting system must follow principles of transparency and impartiality in order to achieve fairness; the electronic voting process must also be protected against cyberattacks or denial-of-service attacks (DDOS) because such attacks may affect the processing time in voting procedures and even hinder the fairness in voting. This study establishes a network security mechanism for voting systems based on blockchain technology. The blockchain mechanism employs a distributed architecture that can prevent system shutdown resulting from malicious cyberattacks; additionally, any user in the blockchain can authenticate data integrity, which satisfies requirements of transparency and impartiality in voting systems. This study utilizes bilinear pairing to establish network security in voting systems, which call for anonymity, authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation. When authenticating voting integrity, the user's anonymity must be ensured to prevent identity revelation, and the data must be protected against malicious tampering such security measures also fulfill blockchain requirements. The proposed voting system relies on the basis of blockchains to create a trustworthy voting system. In current blockchain technology, smart contracts allow the establishment of voter-related regulations to prevent controversies during voting processes. Additionally, in order to establish both a secret ballot and an open ballot system, the study also implements a bilinear pairing security mechanism to ensure the overall security of a voting procedure.

The information flow model is presented to account for the profits caused by asymmetry in modern society within blockchain. In contrast, the thermodynamic model with entropy is used to show the profits in the microcommerce, and predicts that a large block chain may not necessarily increase values.

We propose a novel controllable content distribution framework by using the blockchain technology as well as the iterative self organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA), which is an improved k-means clustering method. To implement an incentive and consensus mechanism utilizing proof-of-stake, we employ smart contract to enforce content distribution in an autonomous way. We conduct some experiments to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrated show that our framework has the advantages of high efficiency, low latency, and good scalability.

AB Blockchain has emerged as a decentralized and trustable ledger for recording and storing digital transactions. The mining process of blockchain, however, requires to consume heavy computation-resources to solve the proof-of-work puzzle, which is prohibitive from the perspective of the conventional mobile terminals (MTs). In this work, we investigate the mobile edge computing (MEC) assisted Blockchain, in which a group of MTs exploit MEC to enhance their computing-powers for solving the proof-of-work puzzle. In particular, we consider the recent advanced multiple-access MEC (MA-MEC) which enables each MT to acquire the computing-powers from several edge servers (ESs) simultaneously. We formulate a joint optimization problem which aims at maximizing the total reward of all MTs, while keeping the fairness among the MTs. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose efficient layered algorithms to compute the optimal solution. Extensive numerical results have been provided to validate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.

AB Blockchain, as secure means for asset transfer, greatly attracts the attention of the global economic community. However, scalability strongly hampers the growth of economic systems based on the blockchain technology. Bi-directional micropayment channels are suitable solutions for scalability on economic systems based on blockchain. However, the challenge presented by micropayment channels is the inefficient routing mechanisms and timelocks generated per channel for a given path chosen to execute a transaction. In this paper, we develop suitable routing algorithms for economic systems based on blockchain. We additionally derive suitable equations to generate unique timelocks for channels belonging to selected paths chosen to execute a transaction. Finally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the protocol based on number of connections and bandwidth with evidence showing the efficiency and scalability of the routing mechanism.

AB The internet has a great development, but the cyber crimes are lack of effective supervision. Furthermore, the network congestion is still a common phenomenon in our daily life. This paper proposes a decentralized web system based on blockchain to solve the above problems. In this scheme, web content publisher uploads the web contents to the IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) net which is a peer to peer storage network, and gets the hashes of the web contents from IPFS system, then writes these hashes to the smart contract which has been deployed on the Ethereum blockchain; thousands of web users can read the hashes of these web contents on this smart contract on Ethereum blockchain, and browse the corresponding web contents by hashes on the decentralized IPFS network. The experimental results show that the decentralized web system based on Ethereum blockchain and IPFS network can provide faster access to web contents than the traditional HTTP web. Further more, this web system has strong ability to withstand large-scale concurrent based on IPFS network which is the decentralized web content storage system without centralized web server and can fight against the malicious tampering attack based on Ethereum blockchain which can resist 51% attack and record all transactions including tampering behaviors on the Ethereum blockchain with timestamp.

AB With the development of information and storage technologies, electronic document recording has become an unalterable trend, which transforms the way that people store, access and operate the data generated in various applications. Healthcare is the leader application domain that pioneers in usage of electronic medical records (EMRs). Cross-organizational EMRs' sharing has many constructive effects in motivating the domain innovation, introducing better domain understanding and overall the domain intelligence. However, the privacy concern, trust issue as well as the sophisticated legal regulation of the sensitive EMRs' use leads to inefficiency in the data sharing process. In this paper, we propose a cross-organizational medical data sharing framework based on permissioned blockchain technology, named "EMRShare", to resolve the trust concern existing in EMRs sharing practice among different participants like patients, clinicians and researchers, and other relevant parties such as the insurance agent and govermnent, to make medical data sharing and access secure, efficient, transparent, immutable, traceable and auditable. A working prototype system is implemented to demonstrate the key features for the cross-organizational medical data sharing and access management. The objective of this work targets at explaining the essential design considerations along with the working principle and operation logics using the blockchain technology to facilitate the medical data sharing in a highly-cooperative healthcare ecosystem.

AB Improving efficiency and performance is an important topic in the world today. As it is well-known, cooperative computing is an effective and traditional approach, and it is widely used in various fields. Inspired by this idea, take E-commerce for example, Security is one of its important indicators. In E-commerce, the security technology has become a major issue restricting the rapid development and popularization of E-commerce. Existing solutions leverage blockchain protocols to improve the credibility of transactions, but most of them have some limitations, such as a lower throughput and higher consensus latency, and these problems make blockchain technology difficult to be widely used. This paper presents a trusted framework (ETTF) using blockchain protocol in E-commerce to achieve a higher credible trading. ETTF includes a peer blockchain protocol (PBP) based on a peer blockchain architecture to support the storage of massive transactions and instant transactions. In PBP, the throughput scales are nearly linearly increased with the computation: the more computing power available, the more blocks are selected per unit time. Besides, in order to ensure a higher security of transactions we have introduced a strong consensus algorithm(ECA) in E-commerce. ETTF is also efficient because the number of messages it requires is nearly linear in the network size. Compared to Bitcoin-derived blockchain, ETTF shows better performance on throughput, latency, and capacity in E-commerce.

AB The public security departments, government agencies and community departments in China should carry out daily supervision and assistance to drug addicts listed in the control. But the responsibility distinction is not clear in the actual work. So it brings low control efficiency, resulting in the lack of file data, data authenticity and other problems. Block chain has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, autonomy, information cannot be altered, cannot be forged and so on. It is superior to centralized database in data security and data sharing. This paper designs a file management system for drug addicts 'management based on block chain, which can effectively guarantee the security and authenticity of data, and realize the sharing of data in the public security industry. It can provide real data reference for the public security organs on the level of drug addicts management and control, and improve the mode of drug addicts management and control.

Moreover, once a single device is attacked, the system crashes. So, blockchain technique which could realize safety distributed data management is introduced. However, the consensus mechanism of blockchain consumes huge computation resources. And the storage of entire ledger also consumes huge storage resources of the blockchain nodes. Due to the limited capacity of IoT devices, the nodes cannot afford the computation resources to reach consensus and caching resources. This paper introduces an architecture of edge computing based blockchain network which makes use of the computation and caching capacity of edge server to help the IoT devices in reaching consensus and storing data.

AB Evolvement of blockchain technology has greatly changed the network and it makes many applications to be distributed, decentralized without loss of security. Ethereum is an open-source blockchain platform that provides a runtime environment for running smart contracts, which is called Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum-based applications are usually referred to as Decentralized Applications (DApps), since they are based on the decentralized EVM, and its smart contracts. Meanwhile, distributed data store also evolves fast with the blockchain technology. Distributed storage develops to reduce the cost of the server side hardware and increase data availability. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a protocol for distributed storage. IPFS stores immutable data, remove duplication, and obtain address information for storage nodes to search for files in the network. Many DApps have been created with the use of these technologies and one example is to use this design for a decentralized Twitter-like system that is resistant to censorship and single point of failure. This paper involves researching the blockchain technology and implementing a decentralised social network application on the Ethereum private blockchain with the use of smart contract and IPFS. In addition, it examines how blockchain and distributed storage can enable more functionalities of traditional social network systems.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that enables new forms of decentralized software architectures, where distributed components can reach agreements on shared system states without trusting a central integration point. Blockchain provides a shared infrastructure to execute programs, called smart contracts, and to store data. Since blockchain technologies are at an early stage, there is a lack of a systematic and holistic view on designing software systems that use blockchain. We view blockchain as part of a bigger system, which requires patterns for using blockchain in the design of their software architecture. In this paper, we collect a list of patterns for blockchain-based applications. The pattern collection is categorized into four types, including interaction with external world patterns, data management patterns, security patterns and contract structural patterns. Some patterns are designed considering the nature of blockchain and how it can be specifically introduced within real-world applications. Others are variants of existing design patterns applied in the context of blockchain-based applications and smart contracts.

AB In this article, we present designs for a Multi Winner Proof of Work (MWPoW) consensus primitive. MWPoW is a consensus protocol that places the group mining idea directly into a protocol to prevent power centralization, higher general reward expectation among participants and shorten the interval time of block generation. It makes every miner a component of one of three groups assigned by the network, not as an individual competitor; all users in the winner group receive compensation. The hash difficulty is higher than ordinary blockchain because there are only three parties in the system. MWPoW powered block-chain is more secure from tampering. The blocks can be quickly final accepted without later block confirms, which makes it possible for block interval time to be minuteness. The experiment suggests the hash rate of MWPoW is around 1500 times larger than Nakamoto blockchain while it only requires about 1 second to finally accept a block in the lab environment (with 3-second block interval). MWPoW is universal profitable (the mining remuneration is much more distributed than Nakamoto block-chain).

These apps solve the problems of labour cost in the restaurants and food court resulting in an increase in overall business. It also provides the owner to manage and make changes as per the requirements in the shop. The customer can order their food by accessing the food app through their mobile. The shopkeeper can easily complete the order in time, as there will be a regular check-in for the availability of ingredients.
   In this paper, we will be representing the overall description and software requirement specification of the entire system designed for use in different food courts. Our apps will provide the restaurant employees to manage their online menu and keep track of all the orders placed by their customers. The customers will be able to access the menu from anywhere so they can order their food and collect it immediately after it is ready. Inside this paper, we have depicted a general model of the framework, layouts of functional and non-functional prerequisites, and a definite portrayal of the UI. Eventually, this idea represents an account of the expansion of the device alongside predicted protection.

AB Publicly Verifiable Randomness has many useful and interesting applications in e-voting, distributed cryptography, secure multiparty computation, lotteries, sports seeding and many more. While the output of a Publicly Verifiable Randomness is provably unpredictable for a strong adversary, it is expected that its closeness to a uniform distribution is verifiable for any party. The inherent randomness in public blockchains such as Bitcoin has been the topic of several research papers and been used in lotteries and other multi-party protocols. However, recently it has been argued that an adversary can have a significant impact on the probability distribution of the output with much lower financial cost. Here, in this paper, we propose a new scheme based on the properties of Verifiable Secret Sharing protocols and Threshold Cryptosystems, that uses semi-trusted third parties to improve the security of Verifiable Public Randomness from any public blockchain. We argue that a successful attack against our scheme to impose a bias on a single bit of the output randomness requires not only a significant financial cost but also a corruption of more than k out of n trusted delegates.

AB The synergy between artificial intelligence and blockchain is increasing in the computing environment. To realize this blockchain technology making its way into applications such as healthcare, financial services, Internet of Things and much more., that use artificial intelligence making it more defendable to attacks. The current blockchain technology uses different encryption algorithms such as SHA256, MD5 etc. The blockchain attacks such as collision attack, primage attack and attacks on wallet motivated us to experiment on partial homomorphic encryption to enhance the strength of blockchain technology. This article considers i) Goldwasser-Micali and ii) Paillier encryption schemes for the comparative evaluation study with a focus on data privacy techniques. We believed and proved that the above two encryption schemes that were considered have less processing time and provide more strength to the possible attacks. While we present our preliminary results in this study, we discuss the pros and cons of the Goldwasser-Micali, Paillier and non-homomorphic encryption schemes that are expected to add value to blockchain technology to be used in Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications.

AB Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is one of the most prominent cryptographic standards offering end-to-end encryption for email messages and other sensitive information. PGP allows to verify the identity of the correspondent in information exchange as well as the information integrity. PGP implements asymmetric encryption with certificates shared through a network of PGP key servers. Many recent breaches show that certificate infrastructure can be compromised as well as exposed to operational errors. In this paper we propose a new PGP management framework with the key server infrastructure implemented using blockchain technology. Our framework resolves some problems of PGP key servers focusing in particular on fast propagation of certificate revocation among key servers and elimination of man-in-the-middle risk. We also provided user access right control where only the certificate holder can change information related to the certificate. We designed and developed a prototype for key server deployment on permissioned Ethereum blockchain. Permissioned blockchain should allow to control the costs of PGP key server infrastructure maintenance at the present level.

Based on the observation and discovery of a common symptom that many attacks may generate, an arbitration mechanism is proposed to determine the approval or abandon of certain transactions involved in confliction. Experimental results verified our statistical assumption and proved that the CCP is robust in handling many transactions in confliction scenarios and can significantly enhance the security of the current bitcoin systems. Unlike many of the existing efforts, this work examines the security issue of bitcoin from a new perspective, which can be extended further to a much larger scope of attack analysis and prevention.

AB The rising digital publishing industry highlights the current problems of digital copyright protection, such as "difficult to confirm rights, difficult to make profits and difficult to protect rights". Admittedly, block chain technology integrates several core technical advantages and has been gradually put into practice in finance, notarization, voting and other fields. However in fact, block chain still has many technical problems which need to be further solved. In this paper, block chain technology and smart contract are introduced into the digital works copyright management. The copyright information storage protocol of this model is based on block chain, which ensures that copyright information can not be tampered falsified. Copyright control agreement based on smart contract, automatic execution and non-interference mechanism ensure the efficient and transparent operation of the model. This model provides copyright registration and copyright query for digital works on the Internet.

AB Blockchain is distributed ledger with the advantage of high security, tamper resistant and traceability. However, in the process of the growth of Blockchain, network isolation hinders the cooperative operation among different Blockchains and greatly restricts the development of Blockchain. There is an urgent need to break the barriers among Blockchains[1], thus cross-chain communication become a new trend of the Blockchain technology[2]. In this paper, we propose CVEM, a value exchange mechanism which supports different kind of tokens transfer cross-chain. First, we put the main exchange process execute off-chain and the final result on-chain. Then, we combine Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract (RSMC) with the idea of cross-token exchange of Blockchain, and use the mechanism of multi-signatures address to constrain the users' behaviors. In addition, we introduce the Simple Payment Verification Proof (SPV Proof) to verify transactions. Our work, to some degree, shortens the transaction process delay and also ensures the security and scalability of the value exchange.

This paper proposes a blockchain based online trading system for DDoS mitigation services, which enables a victim network to on-demand purchase DDoS mitigation services close to the attack sources. The blockchain provides a trust infrastructure for the victim network to find optimal remote service providers, and a sophisticated credit system to evaluate the credibility of players in the system.

AB With the development of marine observation technology and network technology, the volume of marine data growing rapidly. This brings new challenges for data storage and transmission. How to protect data security of marine big data has become an urgent problem. The traditional information security methods' characteristic is centralization. These technologies cannot provide whole process protection, e.g., data storage, data management and application of data. The blockchain technology is a novel technology, which can keep the data security and reliability by using decentralized methodology. It has aroused wide interest in the financial field. In this paper, we describe the concept, characteristics and key technologies of blockchain technology and introduce it into the field of marine data security.

AB Land & property can be identified as one of the core assets in any county in the world. Governments spend significant amount of money to identify, define, manage and maintain the transactional information around land and property in a country. Creating a proper mechanism to make this information available to the public users can be considered as one of the key indications that shows the development of a country. The system currently in use to record land and property transactions in Sri Lanka is a book-based system where all the information is stored in handwritten folios. This method is inefficient, time consuming, unsecured and complex when compared to the advanced systems which are used by developed countries in the world. This study is carried out to find a secured, efficient, cost effective solution with regards to the concerns and other problems related to land and property transactions in Sri Lanka. Proposed solution includes a decentralized ledger to record land and property transactions which runs on top of blockchain technology. All new transaction entries will be validated by smart contracts to verify the validity of the transactions. After performing a proper consensus mechanism, the transaction records will be stored in cryptographically secured blocks. So, the data integrity could not be violated. Additionally, investors and the land buyers can get information about the current market trends & predictions before buying or investing into a land. Also, the proposed system supports the users to view the land information graphically and allows the system users to view the desired land parcels without physically going to the actual location via the geographical information system.

AB Current off-the-shelf Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Flight Data Recorders do not address liability and accountability in the event of an accident. This limitation makes it difficult for necessary stakeholders to determine parties at fault, especially when future operations are expected to be conducted Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLoS). While both on-board and off-board recorders currently exist, the data collected is unsuitable for insurance claims and other legal matters since non-repudiation and tamper-proof mechanisms are not implemented. At the same time, with ongoing developments and improvements to Internet of Things (IoT) telecommunications infrastructure such as LTE-M, 5G, SigFox and NB-IoT protocols, usage of TCP/IP channels and cloud services for UAV Command and Control systems is increasing. This research proposes a real-time, off-board flight logging service using a secure graph database scheme for storage and analysis of flight data recordings. By representing series of logs as an encrypted block chain in graph nodes of a database, it is possible to construct accurate time-lines and enable non-repudiation of operator-UAV and UAV-UAV interactions that provide irrefutable evidence. For proof of concept, this design integrates into the UAV as a Service architecture for BVLOS operations we have proposed in previous publications. The details of the recording protocol, integration into the UAV as a Service platform, data generation simulation and performance results are discussed.

AB This paper presents all studies, methodology, and results about Bitcoin forecasting with PROPHET and ARIMA methods using R analytics platform. To find the most accurate forecast model, the performance metrics of PROPHET and AMNIA methods are compared on the same dataset.
   The dataset selected 16r this study starts from May 2016 and ends in March 2018, which is the interval that Bitcoin values changing significantly against the other currencies. Data is prepared for time series analysis by performing data preprocessing steps such as time stamp conversion and feature selection. Although the time series analysis has a univariate characteristics, it is aimed to include some additional variables to each model to improve the forecasting accuracy. Those additional variables are selected based on different correlation studies between cryptocurrencies and real currencies.
   The model selection for both ARIMA and PROPHET is done by using threefold splitting technique considering the time series characteristics of the dataset. The threefold splitting technique gave the optimum ratios for training, validation, and test sets. Filially two different models are created and compared in terms of performance metrics. Based on the extensive testing we see that PROPHET outperforms ARIMA by 0.94 to 0.68 in R-2 values.

With the growth of circulating IoT devices in human's community, improper device management and firmware distribution mechanism could lead to many issues that harm the security and privacy of the device owner. In this paper, a firmware update framework for IoT devices based on blockchain technology is proposed. The proposed framework aims to provide secure verification on the firmware released by the device manufacturer. In addition, the integrity of distributed firmware to the end-device could be maintained. The proposed firmware update framework consists of four processes: the creation of firmware update contract, the creation of firmware replication contract, the direct firmware update mechanism and the indirect firmware update mechanism.

AB Blockchain is the shared distributed ledger to record the history of transactions. In blockchain network, nodes validate the transactions and reach the consensus on the ordered transactions. The more transactions are happened, the more processing powers of nodes are needed. Shard is introduced to blockchain for processing the multiple transactions in parallel. In this paper, we propose the blockchain for a domain based static sharding. We split a blockchain into multiple shards based on the domain. In each shard, nodes validate the multiple transactions concurrently and keep the shard's ledger separately. With this, it can be processing of low-latency transaction. Also, by changing the composition of committee members that validate blocks dynamically, we can enable the blockchain to be more trust.

AB Cloud service providers offer massive storage space for individuals and enterprises. To guarantee the integrity of outsourced data, a range of data auditing schemes have been proposed. The auditing tasks in these schemes are typically performed by a Third Party Auditor (TPA)responsible for periodically checking the integrity of user data. However, such a centralized auditing framework is vulnerable and as a third party, the auditor cannot be fully trusted. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and smart public auditing scheme for cloud storage, which eliminates the involvement of the TPA and improves the reliability of auditing schemes. We build a protocol for automatic data integrity checking in a decentralized environment based on a smart contract, which eliminates the involvement of data owners and data users. Performance analysis and experiments show that our scheme is efficient and favorable.

AB Although cryptocurrencies have witnessed explosive growth in the past year, they have also raised many concerns, among which a crucial one is the scalability issue of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies. Suffering from the large overhead of global consensus and security assurance, even leading cryptocurrencies can only handle up to tens of transactions per second, which largely limits their applications in real-world scenarios. Among many proposals to improve cryptocurrency scalability, one of the most promising and mature solutions is the payment channel network (PCN), which offers off-chain settlement of transactions with minimal involvement of expensive blockchain operations. In this paper, we investigate the problem of payment routing in PCN. We suggest crucial design goals in PCN routing, and propose a novel distributed dynamic routing mechanism called CoinExpress. Through extensive simulations, we have shown that our proposed mechanism is able to achieve outstanding payment acceptance ratio with low routing overhead.

AB With the promotion of power energy market reform, it has been a trend to allow distributed energy agents and other multi-subject agents to participate in the market competition. However, due to the existing power market mechanism is designed according to the centralized power supply mode, the public services, power market transaction mechanism and government management system for distributed energy transaction is still more missing. The blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, transparency, fairness, openness and so on. Under the background of the transactive energy system, a decentralized distributed energy transaction mechanism based on blockchain smart contract technology is proposed, which includes auditing, bidding, clearing and settlement. It realizes P2P energy trading among prosumers.

AB With the development of geographic information system, digital earth and digital city play more and more important roles in life. The data generated by sensors or other edge nodes need to be collected by crawlers in the distributed systems in IoT, such as the GIS data in CyberGIS. In some edge networks, network operators have adopted methods to limit crawlers, such as blocking the request IP addresses, requiring logging in verification codes and other measures to avoid disturbance to servers. To collect data from web servers in these types of edge networks, a dynamic IP address based strategy DP-crawler is proposed to solve the anti-crawler strategies in the edge networks. DP-crawler can dynamic get proper IP addresses from a security-aware list and select the best available proxies. The security-aware list is designed to use the block-chain. Security and dynamic storage can be achieved by this method. DP-crawler is used to crawler webs, and the detailed information of Douban movies are obtained in the experiments. The experiment results show that the DP-Crawler can get more information by using the DP-Crawler.

AB With the rapid development of blockchain technology, blockchain becomes a good platform for execution of smart contracts. However, since smart contracts still have a low performance of transaction processing on blockchain. It can't satisfy real-time requirements in some situations. This paper proposes a parallel smart contract model on blockchain which has a better performance in transaction processing. The challenges with the proposed approach are the implementation of the parallel mode and the solution of synchronization problem of the proposed model. This paper uses multi-thread technology to implement the proposed model where transactions are executed in parallel. Then we propose a transaction splitting algorithm to resolve the synchronization problem. Finally, experimental analysis proves that this parallel model exactly makes a remarkable development of performance in transaction processing.

AB Blockchain is a new decentralized and distributed network applying technologies such as P2P network, cryptography and so on, in which P2P lays the foundation. Various consensus mechanisms, which correspond to trust models in P2P, solve the trust problems caused due to the anonymity of nodes. In addition, different incentive models are established in the P2P and blockchain network to encourage nodes to share resources subjectively, thereby improving the contribution of nodes to the system. Based on the analysis of trust and incentive models in P2P, this paper summarizes the consensus and incentive mechanisms of blockchain network. What's more, we indicate the future prospects in blockchain including the improvement of blockchain derived from P2P, the idea of a coin free blockchain, the problems faced by blockchain, issues about blockchain storage and blockchain application scenarios, which will provide guidance for the future study of blockchain network.

AB With the popularity of cloud storage, how to verify the integrity of data on the cloud has become a challenging problem. Traditional verification framework involves the Third Party Auditors (TPAs) which are not entirely credible. In this paper, we present a framework for blockchain-based data integrity verification in P2P cloud storage, making verification more open, transparent, and auditable. In this framework, we present Merkle trees for data integrity verification, and analyze the system performance under different Merkle trees structures. Furthermore, we develop rational sampling strategies to make sampling verification more effective. Moreover, we discuss the optimal sample size to tradeoff the conflict between verification overhead and verification precision, and suggest two efficient algorithms of order of verification. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the schemes of our framework. The experimental results show that our schemes can effectively improve the performance of data integrity verification.

AB JointCloud computing is a new generation cloud computing model based on collaboration among Cloud Service Providers, making resources from multiple clouds deeply integrated, and supporting customize cloud service. To achieve the data confirmation Right when doing data trading to prevent resell is one of the most important challenges faced by such JointCloud environment. In this paper, we propose the JointCloud Computing Data Trading Architecture (JCDTA), an optimized data trading architecture for cross-stakeholder. Firstly, the announced mechanism is used to extract the data resources summary and the owner information into blockchain. Secondly, the untampering of the blockchain is used to record the data resources information, such as data resources statement information, data resources transaction records and data resources operation records. Finally, the supervision mechanism confirms the declaration of the data sources while the encryption technology ensures the privacy of the data resources. JCDTA guarantees the security and the reliability of data trading in the JointCloud environment and ensures the value invariance of data resources.

AB In the cryptocurrency world, Bitcoin holds the first place in terms of market cap and currency price, which makes it the first target and victim of attack attempts. Indeed, there are various attacks against cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin in particular, e.g., block withholding, transaction malleability and the Eclipse attack- The latter, allows an attacker to completely isolate a peer and to monopolize all permanent connections front/to the victim. However, in this attack, the non permanent connections, remains non monopolized by the attacker, which can disturb the attack success. In this paper, we propose (I) a characterization of the misbehavior mechanism applied by Bitcoin and its weaknesses; and (2) a new method to realize the Eclipse attack which monopolizes all the peer's connections, even the non permanent ones, with a minimal number of IP addresses. Our characterization and attack realization, were performed on the main Bitcoin network and on a real client.

AB Trust management has been a topic of keen interest in recent years. There has been a lot of discussion as to what new opportunities it can bring to markets, what benefits it can offer, and what system development possibilities it enables for software development. In this paper we discuss trust management and business critical information sharing in a definite group of stakeholders called Circle of Trust. We examine the key features of the Circle of Trust in military environments. We address the most essential problems and obstacles to be considered before the benefits of Circle of Trust can be fully enabled therein. As a solution to problems with the information transfer management, we propose a novel conceptual approach which ensures the privacy of the data source and transparency of information sharing utilizing the blockchain technology and modern cryptographic solutions. In addition, the concept presented enables the quantitative information trade and objective control mechanism for contractual liabilities within the consortium. The discussion and views presented in this paper can be adopted in any organization with doubts concerning the sensitive and classified contents of supply chain management or current ICT systems.

AB As it was mostly developed in a non-academic context, the literature on the blockchain often lacks of mathematical rigour. Therefore, fundamental computational problems of this new technology such as consensus, Byzantine fault tolerance and self-stabilization can not be fully looked into. In this work we use the principles of distributed computing to introduce a topological structure with the purpose of facilitating the study of the blockchain. Our model exploits classical topological tools used in the context of distributed systems to describe the evolution of a blockchain. Different assumptions on the input assignments, number of generated blocks and latency of the system are considered in our analysis. Furthermore, we define a probabilistic structure to enrich our model and to add also a predictive capability.

AB In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), provenance is vital for assessing data's trustworthiness, detecting the misbehaviors conducted by adversaries or troubleshooting communication failures. The provenance can be encoded through fingerprinting the node IDs along a packet path where the packets are generated, forwarded and/or aggregated. Because WSNs are resource-tightened networks, most of the known provenance schemes applied in WSNs address the issues on how to reduce the provenance size with various compression techniques only. However, reducing the provenance size at a sensor node also costs too much energy. In addition, such schemes did not take the secure and persistant provenance storage for consideration in a long term. To fill the gap, we propose a blockchain-based data provenance scheme (BCP) of compression free, where the provenances are stored distributively on the nodes along the packet path and the BS can retrieve the provenance on demand through a query process. An edge computing based monitor network consisting of high performance nodes (H-nodes) is deployed above or nearby the WSNs, which keeps the WSN's provenance data in a blockchain-based database. The security and authenticity of the provenances are then protected. What's more, the WSN is released from consuming much energy in handling provenance data, which is more superior to all the previous schemes. Both the simulation and experiment results show that our scheme BCP is more energy efficient and secure than those of the known distributed data provenances.

AB Current digital certification revocation systems are insufficient in the application scenario of multiple certification authorities (CAs), and it leads to a lack of mutual trust, access stability, and timeliness of data synchronization between CAs. We propose a decentralized digital certificate revocation system based on consortium blockchain technology with a secret sharing scheme. It can invalidate the digital certificate in special cases to protect the user's information and property security. Based on the characteristics of the decentralized consensus mechanism, consortium blockchain technology is the core technology of the system. The scheme achieves collaborative management of digital certificate revocation lists (CRLs) by multiple CAs, and introduces secret sharing scheme, further safeguarding the reliability of the maintenance process, and then the online certificate status protocol (OCSP) can be developed based on this system. This system is security, effective, and cannot be tampered. Compared with the traditional revocation scheme, it achieves trusted and reliable CRL system above multiple CAs, which can provide new ideas for the way of digital certificate revocation and expand the application range of blockchain technology.

AB The sharing economy is an emerging research field. The form of sharing economy that is emerged by using many information technologies such as the mobile Internet, the big data, the cloud computing, the block chain, etc. profoundly influences and changes the traditional economic form of human society with the emerging economic formats in the information age. Under the background of the new era, clarifying the basic connotation, performance characteristics and main functions of the sharing economy can attach a great significance on better promoting the high-quality development of the sharing economy and building a modern economic system. It is believed in this article that the connotation of the sharing economy can be grasped from the scope of development, motivation, ideas and models. The sharing economy has the characteristics of rapid development, diversified subjects, clear operating mechanism and differences in economic composition. We then derive 9 variables with almost equal importance which reflect the development of sharing economy through Factor Analysis. The development of sharing economy has entered a new era. While promoting the development of shared economy, we should promote the deep integration of new and old formats, foster the sharing of information and cultural genes, build a pragmatic and invasive system, apply an inclusive and prudent regulatory system, and create a social environment of joint construction and sharing. This article helps to deepen the understanding of the sharing economy and has certain reference value for theoretical research and practical development in this field.

AB In the upcoming evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT), it is anticipated that billions of devices will be connected to the Internet. Many of these devices are capable of collecting information from individual users and their physical surroundings. They are also capable of taking smart actions, which are usually from a backend cloud server in the IoT system. While IoT promises a more connected and smarter world, this pervasive large-scale data collection, storage, sharing, and analysis raise many privacy concerns.
   In the current IoT ecosystem, IoT service providers have full control of the collected user data. While the original intended use of such data is primarily for smart IoT system and device control, the data is often used for other purposes not explicitly consented to by the users. We propose a novel user privacy protection framework, PrivacyGuard, that aims to empower users with full privacy control of their data. PrivacyGuard framework seamlessly integrates two new technologies, blockchain and trusted execution environment (TEE). By encoding data access policy and usage as smart contracts, PrivacyGuard can allow data owners to control who can have what access to their data, and be able to maintain a trustworthy record of their data usage. Using remote attestation and TEE, PrivacyGuard ensures that data is only used for the intended purposes approved by the data owner. Our approach represents a significant departure from traditional privacy protections which often rely on cryptography and pure software-based secure computation techniques. Addressing the fundamental problem of data usage control, PrivacyGuard will become the cornerstone for free market of private information.

AB The recent explosion of interest in blockchain led to a plethora of researches on consensus algorithms. Compared with hitcoin-derived consensus mechanisms, Byzantine Fault-Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are more applicable for consortium blockchain. However, these algorithms work lies in the foundation that 3f + 1 nodes are required to tolerate only f faults, which results in high network traffic and cost. The hybrid fault model with Trusted Components (TC) assistance is proposed to reduce the minimum to 2f +1 and improve overall performance. In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic principles of BFT algorithms based on the hybrid fault model. Then we analyze different TC abstractions and implementation scenarios, and express our own choices. The general framework for BFT algorithms design choices and the applications of this model in blockchain are also discussed. Therefore, this paper aims to provide guidance for reasonable design of efficient BFT algorithms and application of TC assistance mechanism.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and it realizes the circulation and distribution of cryptocurrency via miners contributing their computational power to solve a cryptographic puzzle. With more and more people participating in Bitcoin mining, the continuous growing of the computational power might greatly reduce the time for finding a new valid block. To keep the stability of the Bitcoin system, the difficulty of the Bitcoin network will be adjusted every 2016 blocks. This paper aims to study the principles of the difficulty adjustment of the whole Bitcoin blockchain network in Bitcoin mining. We first describe the computing process of the target and thus the difficulty of a block, and then study its influence factors and their effect on the difficulty. After that, we study the adjustment of the difficulty, and propose a framework for the adjustment of the difficulty that can be easily used in practice. Our work can help researchers better understand the principles of Bitcoin mining.

AB In this paper, we propose an access control solution for exchanging Blockchain-based Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) called BBACS (Block-based Access Control Scheme) that includes an access model and an access scheme. Unlike the existing Blockchain-oriented access schemes for EMRs, our access model can omit the agent layer (gateway) in order to authorise users' access with block level granularity, whilst maintaining compatibility with the underlying Blockchain data structure. Furthermore, the authorisation, encryption, and decryption algorithms presented in BBACS dispense with the need to use a public key infrastructure (PKI) and hence cut down the cost of network construction and improve the computational performance. We validated the efficiency (time cost) of local computation and data transmission (over Wi-Fi) for BBACS using a simulation of BBACS against another Blockchain-oriented access control scheme for EMRs called HDG as our baseline. To the best of our knowledge, BBACS is the first Blockchain-oriented access control solution without the need for an agent (or gateway) design, supporting granular authorisation (block level), that has been proposed for secure EMRs management in eHealth.

AB In this paper, we address the issue of electricity trading in residential electricity market. In recent years, the residential electricity trading has draw more and more attention, the households that produce excessive electricity sell electricity to households that lack of electricity, however the existence of the manage center brings a huge risk to users, once the center goes crashed, the households will suffer economics losses and there is a great possibility of the leakage of users' personal information. To tackle these issues, we propose a peer-to-peer electricity trading mechanism based on blockchain, under our mechanism each user has a distributed ledger maintained by all households and there is no existence of such a manage center, eliminating the danger of all users suffering huge economic losses when the management center goes crashed. Besides, each user in the market can have multiple virtual addresses that are used to sell and purchase electricity, and other users cansellers submit trading information includes unit pricenot identify their identities via virtual addresses, these virtual addresses protect users' privacy from leaking. The experimental results show the consumption of our proposed mechanism is logical and small, which illustrates the reasonability of our mechanism in time consumption.

AB Under the background of rapid development of distributed renewable energy (DRE) and demand response (DR), the traditional DR will develop into integrated demand response (IDR). The current centralized trading of electricity market model is unable to meet the trading needs of scattered IDR resources. As the decentralized and distributed accounting mode, the blockchain technology fits the requirement of IDR resources to participate in energy market. The blockchain-based DRE transaction platform can support the credible transaction and settlement between the IDR resources, and promote the development of DER. Corresponding to the transaction principle, the frame of blockchain-based IDR resources transaction scheme was proposed. The transactions between DER and DR are taken for example to explain the detail trading process. Finally, the smart contracts of the transactions are designed and deployed on Ethereum private blockchain to prove the validity of the proposed transaction scheme.

AB Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI), as the main technical support of Web service, plays an increasingly important role in SOA (Service Oriented Architecture). Smart contract technology based on blockchain is used to solve the problem of data replication and sharing between UDDI registries. The UDDI registry only stores the information of simple service description and reference to the blockchain, and provides identity management, authority management, and other functions. The detailed information of the service provider and the services it provides is stored in the blockchain. The cost of the UDDI registry is greatly reduced, and the sharing and storage of data can be easily realized. Meanwhile, the security and auditability of data are guaranteed by the characteristics of the blockchain. This paper innovatively introduces the blockchain into the field of service computing, which provides a new idea for future research.

AB A great many cloud users face a difficult challenge in respect of the forthcoming EU General Data Protection Regulation, which comes into effect on 25th May, 2018. While all computer systems are continuously under attack, those who operate conventional distributed network systems stand a far greater chance of being able to demonstrate compliance than those who use cloud based systems. The main reason for this discrepancy between the two approaches is down to the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem, meaning many cloud users will be completely unable to demonstrate compliance with the new regulation, thus exposing themselves to potentially massive fines after 25th May. We consider the possible use of a crypto-currency based mechanism to address the as yet unsolved cloud forensic problem. Crypto-currencies are becoming a global phenomenon, gaining more attention from media, venture capitalists, financial and government institutions. We focus on the operational risk and the market risk related to crypto-currencies, especially the dominating Bitcoin. Operational risk encompasses the actions that undermine the technological infrastructure and security assumptions of crypto-currencies. We discuss how blockchain technology could improve the efficiency of financial infrastructures, as well as the inevitable vulnerabilities of operational risk of software, open-source governance, and code maintenance. We summarise the literature findings on the co-movement of cryptocurrencies with different currencies, indices, and commodities, to show the role of crypto-currency as a commodity, currency, or a speculative investment under portfolio diversification theory. Particularly now that we have seen successful attacks on cryptocurrencies in action, it is important to understand where these weaknesses lie, and to endeavour to find out to what extent the use of such technology might expose companies using this technology for GDPR compliance. In the light of the robustness of this approach, we consider whether the underlying blockchain technology could, in turn, be practically applied to addressing the cloud forensic problem. This paper looks at the pros and cons of the blockchain/bitcoin approach, seeking to identify weaknesses, potential benefits offered versus the additional resource costs/latency involved, and considers whether such an approach might be used to secure cloud forensic trails.

AB Since the generation of Bitcoin, it has gained attention of all sectors of the society. Law breakers committed crimes by utilizing the anonymous characteristics of Bitcoin. Recently, how to track malicious Bitcoin transactions has been proposed and studied. To address the challenge, existing solutions have limitations in accuracy, comprehensiveness, and efficiency. In this paper, we study Bitcoin blackmail virus WannaCry event incurred in May 2017. The three Bitcoin addresses disclosed in this blackmail event are only restricted to receivers accepting Bitcoin sent by victims, and no further transaction has been found yet. Therefore, we acquire and verify experimental data by example of similar Bitcoin blackmail virus CryptoLocker occurred in 2013. We focus on how to track malicious Bitcoin transactions, and adopt a new heuristic clustering method to acquire incidence relation between addresses of Bitcoin and improved Louvain clustering algorithm to further acquire incidence relation between users. In addition, through a lot of experiments, we compare the performance of our algorithm with another related work. The new heuristic clustering method can improve comprehensiveness and accuracy of the results. The improved Louvain clustering algorithm can increase working efficiency. Specifically, we propose a method acquiring internal relationship between Bitcoin addresses and users, so as to make Bitcoin transaction deanonymisation possible, and realize a better utilization of Bitcoin in the future.

AB Nowadays, home Internet has attracted a lot of interest. Dynamic-enabled Defense Strategy can reduce the possibility of being hacked to become the mining systems for blockchain. In order to reflect the status of the smart home system more accurately, this paper proposed a method to improve the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) and make CVSS more suitable for the smart home system. The proposed method can obtain vulnerabilities scores, reflecting the security status of the system accurately and providing strong support for system security defense and reinforcement. For dynamically-enabled defense with constantly changing state, it is hard for the attacker to obtain all the information in a short time, since it requires too many resources when the changing frequency is too high. Whereas the attacker has enough time to analyze the system with low changing frequency. Combining with the improved vulnerability scoring system, we propose a dynamic-enable defense strategy based on Markov chain and stochastic Petri net to calculate the attack detection probability and the vulnerability value of the system, and obtain the best dynamic switching interval to ensure the security of the system.

AB Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrency systems, especially Ethereum. It permits complex financial transactions or rules through scripts, which is called smart contracts. Since Ethereum smart contracts hold millions of dollars, their execution correctness is crucial against attacks which aim at stealing the assets. In this paper, we proposed a security assurance method for smart contract source code to find potential security risks. It contains two main functions, the first is syntax topological analysis of smart contract invocation relationship, to help developers to understand their code structure clearly; the second is logic risk (which may lead to vulnerabilities) detection and location, and label results on topology diagram. For developers' convenience, we have built a static analysis tool called SASC to generate topology diagram of invocation relationship and to find potential logic risks. We have made an evaluation on 2,952 smart contracts, experiment results proved that our method is intuitive and effective.

AB Recent advances in blockchain technologies have provided exciting opportunities for decentralized applications. Specifically, blockchain-based smart contracts enable credible transactions without authorized third parties. The attractive properties of smart contracts facilitate distributed data vending, allowing for proprietary data to be securely exchanged on a blockchain. Distributed data vending can transform domains such as healthcare by encouraging data distribution from owners and enabling large-scale data aggregation. However, one key challenge in distributed data vending is the trade-off dilemma between the effectiveness of data retrieval and the leakage risk from indexing the data. In this paper, we propose a framework for distributed data vending through a combination of data embedding and similarity learning. We illustrate our framework through a practical scenario of distributing and aggregating electronic medical records on a blockchain. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is a network that connects lots of smart devices around the world. As a revolutionary technology, it has been developing rapidly in recent years. This paper summarizes the obstacles of IoT in terms of security and efficient operation network and introduces the Blockchain to solve these problems. Nowadays, many IoT application use the traditional central structure and collect all data in one center node. However, with connected devices on the rise, it is required that the center node should have a huge computing power, storage space and bandwidth, thus making the operation cost become higher. For IoT, another focus is all about private and security. All transaction data are stored in the third party, which means hackers can break security barriers and steal user information easily. Moreover, some businessmen will sell user information to other parties without owner's authorization. Through this paper we find that Blockchain can provide a distributed, transparent platform with trustless mechanism and collective maintenance of security for the IoT. But, applying Blockchain directly to IoT may result in many problems, such as limited resource, longer delays, poor scalability. At present, there is not a Blockchain model which can be applied in large scale IoT networks. The future study can be followed along this line.

Among numerous key technologies and practice of EI, vehicle to grid (V2G) provides a feasible solution to reduce the level of demand-supply mismatch by leveraging the bidirectional energytrading capabilities of electric vehicles (EVs). In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient V2G energy trading framework by exploring blockchain and edge computing. First, we develop a consortium blockchain-based secure energy trading mechanism for V2G. Then, edge computing has been incorporated to improve the successful probability of block creation. The computational resource allocation problem is modeled as a two-stage Stackelberg leader-follower game, and the optimal strategies are obtained by using the backward induction approach. Finally, the performance of the proposed framework is validated via numerical results and theoretical analysis.

AB The state-of-the-art mobile edge applications are generating intense traffic and posing rigorous latency requirements to service providers. While resource sharing across multiple service providers today requires a centralized, trusted repository maintained by all parties for service providers to share status. We propose EdgeChain, a blockchain-based architecture to make mobile edge application placement decisions for multiple service providers, based on a stochastic programming problem minimizing the placement cost for mobile edge application placement scenarios. All placement transactions are stored on the blockchain and are traceable by every mobile edge service provider and application vendor who consumes resources at the mobile edge.

AB Application services in cloud computing model have complex scheduling, composition, configuration and deployment conditions, even in the multi-condition requirements, it can also be based on the change of time to schedule virtual services. Therefore, the demand of optimizing cloud computing scheduling strategy to ensure cloud data security and recovery ability is increasingly prominent.This paper proposes a trusted distributed audit method for cloud task scheduling, which is used for the trusted storage of cloud task scheduling information in the cloud cluster. This method mainly uses a distributed solution that combines block chain technology and traditional cloud server to solve the problem of integrity and security of cloud task scheduling, in order to prevent potential. The vulnerabilities in the system cause significant losses to the system. The architecture of this paper is composed of four parts: cloud cluster, control system, block chain network, and cloud database. We store the hash data of cloud task scheduling information into blockchain network and store the original data to the cloud data base, which guarantees the cloud task within the cloud cluster. Data security and integrity, and provide a new idea for future research system recovery.

AB While smart contracts are praised widely, it should be noted that they have their disadvantages: lack of control over data protection and executive correctness or consistency. Aiming at this problem, we propose SMPC-based smart contract platform with three-layer structure: contract, computing, and group communication layer. In contract layer, we put forward SMPC-based smart contract framework, which gives the implementation process, language structure and grammar specification of smart contracts. In computing layer, fair SMPC algorithms based on general linear secret sharing scheme are designed to implement verifiable collaboration computing with input privacy and computation correctness. In group communication layer, the non-blocking broadcast is developed from non-blocking message passing interface (MPI) in order to ensure secure group communication in asynchronous networks with node and link failures. Finally, the results of simulation experiments with private currency transfers indicate that our platform is efficient and secure enough for common smart contracts.

AB Bitcoin blockchain is growing big, yet its transaction capacity hit its limits in 2017. One solution heavily discussed within the bitcoin community is to let it grow faster by increasing size of the blocks. However, making transactions smaller instead of blocks bigger is more sustainable and also brings other additional benefits. In this paper, we focus on space wasted by non-cryptographic use of hashes and uncompressed numbers within transaction inputs. In our analyses, we show that transactions can be made approximately 16% smaller, depending on their complexity.

AB this paper focuses on the performance evaluation of consensus algorithms used in a blockchain system for Internet of Things (IoT). In such systems the time necessary to achieve consensus should be small. Three most used consensus algorithms (modified proof of work, practical byzantine fault tolerance and binary consensus) are evaluated in different situations - type of motes, number of nodes participating in consensus algorithm and radio propagation model. An integrated solution is proposed to adapt an IoT node to different consensus algorithm. The simulations in Contiki IoT operating system show good performance (time to achieve consensus less than seconds)

AB Blockchain has been widely recognized as the trust machine underpinning the Internet of Things(IoT). However, the poor performance of the existing mainstream platforms renders this expectation unattainable. New technologies like DAG and Hashgraph emerge as promising candidates to address the pressing issues, but their abilities in decentralized consensus are still in question. We propose a 3D-DAG model to address the trilemma of decentralization, scalability and security. Experiment results show that, by adopting the separation of concerns(SOC) architectural principle and a software defined chain(SDC) approach, 3D-DAG can meet challenging requirements expected by IoT applications.

The ChainFS middleware exposes a file-system interface to end users. Internally, ChainFS stores data files in the cloud and exports minimal and necessary functionalities to the Blockchain for key distribution and file operation logging. We implement the ChainFS system on Ethereum and S3FS and closely integrate it with FUSE clients and Amazon S3 cloud storage. We measure the system performance and demonstrate low overhead.

TI A technological transformation of secured transactions law: visibility,
   monitoring, and enforcement
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
AB Modern economies are highly dependent on the existence and the proper operation of the credit market. Nevertheless, the credit market has failures. Then, a sound, predictable, and credible secured transaction system is an effective stimulus for credit, as it mitigates risks and alleviates such market malfunctions. Despite the notable success in the formulation of more and more effective legal solutions, in practice, the secured transactions legal system is imperfect as well. These imperfections debilitate the impact of legal strategies on the real market, undermine the capacity to repair market failures, and weaken the efficacy of legal solutions. The Paper identifies limitations of the secured transactions system in three critical areas: publicity is modest, monitoring is costly, and enforcement is limited. The aim of this Paper is, firstly, to study how the incorporation of the most recent digital technology developments to the different stages of secured transactions could mitigate such imperfections of the system and enhance its effectiveness; and, secondly, to single out some legal implications a systematic, pervasive, and extensive application of technology could entail. To that end, some digital technology developments have been selected (Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-based solutions, Internet-of-Things (IoT) schemes, smart contracts, electronic platforms) to be applied, solely or combined, to the three imperfect components of any secured transactions system to observe how the effectiveness of the system is enhanced accordingly, and to anticipate which implications such an incorporation into the system might imply. It is concluded that the implementation of technological solutions to perform legal functions and repair imperfections and failures of the legal system foresee a panorama of incredible opportunities, but also arouse a number of legal concerns that should be anticipated and confronted in a timely manner.

TI A proposal for UNCITRAL to develop a Model Law on Warehouse Receipts
SO UNIFORM LAW REVIEW
AB This article fleshes out a proposal made during the fourth International Secured Transactions Colloquium, held in March 2017, for United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) to develop a model legal framework for warehouse receipts. It argues that most developing economies have sufficient warehousing infrastructure and secondary markets but lack a modern warehouse receipts law. To support this argument, it includes a summary of the recent projects funded by various agencies to promote the warehousing of goods and, in particular, agricultural commodities. It describes the recent efforts to create a model framework for warehouse receipts and provides guidance on the establishment of a warehouse receipts system by entities such as the Organization of American States, the World Bank Group, and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Furthermore, the article analyses the work of UNCITRAL in the field of negotiable documents and concludes that such work has not addressed many aspects typically regulated by warehouse receipts laws. The analysis also focuses on the emerging practice of issuing electronic warehouse receipts, their trading through commodity exchanges, and the utilization of emerging technologies, such as blockchain, to dematerialize warehouse receipts. Finally, the article explores the most common modalities of warehousing services, the parties involved in warehouse receipts transactions, the characteristics of warehouse receipts in different jurisdictions, and the benefits of electronic systems, identifying the areas that ought to be covered in a model warehouse receipts framework.

TI China in the 2010s: The Economy of Overheating
SO EKONOMICHESKAYA POLITIKA
AB In recent years, the word "overheating" is very often used regarding to China's economy. Indeed, over the past 8 years equity market bubble of 2014-2015, real estate bubbles of 2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2015-2017 and bitcoin market bubble of 2016 were in the spotlight. Upon close analysis it is found that the bubbles were provoked by the policy of the authorities. The formation of a bubble forces regulators to implement restrictive measures, but at the same time the authorities stimulate the emergence of a rush demand on another market. Investors' funds flow into another market, which leads to the formation of a new bubble. Maintenance of markets in overheating condition is a very atypical policy. It is necessary to clarify what mechanisms are used by the Chinese authorities for markers's overheating and cooling. It is also important to understand the goals of such a policy in order to analize China's economy and to make predictions of further PRC development. It is illustrated in this article that the main reason to push the authorities to create conditions for bubble emergence is the necessity to stimulate private consumption. In China, there is a historically determined problem of the abnormally high propensity to save. The creation of bubbles is an attempt to overcome population habits, an effort to "accustom" the Chinese not to put all the money into a deposit or "under the mattress". Investing part of the funds in investment goods with almost guaranteed high yield, the Chinese receive additional income, and, as statistics show, they increase consumption.

TI Saving Deployment Costs of Smart Contracts by Eliminating Gas-wasteful
   Patterns
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Smart contracts are blockchain-based programs that have developed with the emergence of Ethereum, one of the most well-known blockchains. Gas, paid in Ethers (i.e., the cryptocurrency in Ethereum), is required for the costs to upload and run smart contracts on Ethereum. As cost-inefficiently designed smart contracts result in unnecessary costs, it is vital to eliminate any gas-wasteful code fragments to optimize the deployment costs. In this study, we define five gas-wasteful patterns: 'Over-public variables', 'Redundant initial values', 'Loose packing', 'Non-base unit types', and 'Non-constant variables', based on the state variables in Solidity, the most commonly used implementation language for smart contracts in Ethereum. We also propose improvement methods related to these patterns and a solution to identify and eliminate the patterns. Furthermore, we analyze 143 real-world contracts deployed on Ethereum and find that 56% of them include the above-mentioned patterns. We also upgrade 43 of the pattern-matched contracts and demonstrate that their deployment costs are decreased on an average by 13.47%, and the most-reduced rate is 64%.

TI A Study on Secure and Efficient KSI System based on Multi Path Hash
   Chain with Universal Hashing Function
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING
AB Recent advances in quantum computer technology and Shor algorithms have increased the importance of new data integrity verification for the security of existing public key cryptography. Keyless signature can perform high-speed data integrity verification using only hash operation and immunity to quantum computer using One Time Password(OTP). Keyless Signature Infrastructure(KSI) is an environment for Keyless Signature. It provides user certificate creation through distributed network server and block time chain global time stamp token for message integrity. However, when a large number of users are added to the KSI and the OTP is managed, the number of end nodes increases, which increases the KSI overhead. In this paper, we propose a KSI system that reduces overhead by efficiently merging a large number of nodes by applying multi path hash chain. Finally, we proposed universal hashing function so that improved secure KSI system.

TI Dynamic Responses of a Flexible Floating Anti-collision System Under
   Random Waves
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFSHORE AND POLAR ENGINEERING
AB The present experimental study investigated a flexible floating anti-collision system consisting of block chains, buoys, mooring chains, and gravity anchors. The motions of the central buoy and tensions of the block and mooring chains were measured under random waves with normal incidence. The results showed that both the motion and tension amplitudes increased with the incident significant wave height, but the increment decreased due to the effect of the nonlinear mooring chains. The edge mooring chain and block chain appeared to dominate the characteristics of the multi-frequencies, which can mainly be attributed to the sway motion of the buoys as well as the relative movements of the coupled buoys. The surge motion was found to contribute to the tension responses on the edge mooring chain due to the oscillation of the system in the axial direction.

TI Use of distributed ledger technology by central banks: A review
SO ENFOQUE UTE
AB This paper reviews what stage the central banks of the world's leading economies are at in their study and adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to reengineer their various systems and functions. A brief description of DLT will be given, followed by an analysis of central banks' publications and pronouncements to determine what each central bank is doing on their journey to DLT adoption. It was found that of the central banks for which information was available, all of them have expressed interest in DLT and have evaluated it to some extent. Nevertheless, no central bank has an operational DLT-based system at this point. This is because some issues remain regarding the speed, cost of processing, security, transparency and privacy, legal settlement finality, scalability and network effects of the technology. As DLT matures, the expectation is that these issues will begin to be resolved.

TI Towards an Ethical Online Payment System through Cryptography and Next
   Generation Communication Network
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SECURITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The Internet brings unprecedented connectivity and communications for both social and commercial settings. There have been many businesses that offer their products and services completely online. Nowadays, even the break and mortar businesses use the Internet in a way or another to promote their offerings and to reach people and places they would have never thought of reaching them before the Internet era. Conventional online payment systems such as credit and debit cards have enabled such a revolutionary way of doing business. However, conventional financial system has been generating catastrophic disasters to the world. The great depression of 1930s, the World War II, the dot com bubble at the beginning of the new century, and the recent financial crisis that has begun on 2008; to name a few. This will persist if we keep trusting the old ways of finance. This paper investigates the relatively new online payment system termed "Bitcoin" which embraces intentionally or unintentionally the principle of Islamic finance such as saving, compared to the conventional financial system of borrowing, lending and "Riba" (interest).

TI On the Continuity and Origin of Identity in Distributed Ledgers:
   Learning from Russell's Paradox
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB This article studies the origin and continuity of the identity of the entities inscribed in a distributed ledger. Specifically, it focuses on the differences between the identities of the entities that exist in a distributed ledger and those of the entities that exist outside the ledger but must be represented in the ledger in order to interact with it. It suggests that a distributed ledger that contains representations of entities that exist outside the ledger can yield a continuum of interconnected existing and past identities that is constantly redefined to represent new conceptual entities. This continuum can be understood as a metasortalor a sortal of sortalsthat resembles the mathematical structure of a set of sets. Further, the article presents the dilemma that arises when representing the identities of entities in a distributed ledger, and it draws an analogy between this dilemma and Russell's Paradox.

TI The Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology - Short Form for
   Adolescents (DAPP-SF-A): normative data for Flemish adolescents aged 16
   to 21 years
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY
AB Background: The Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology - Short Form for Adolescents (DAPP-SF-A) is an age-adapted version of the DAPP Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). The psychometric properties of this questionnaire were established by Tromp and Koot. However, norming data are currently available exclusively for Dutch adolescents.
   Objective: The main aim of this study was to provide community-based norming data for the DAPP-SF-A in Flemish adolescents and separately for boys and girls. The second aim was to compare the Flemish norms with the Dutch norms.
   Method: The sample consisted of 425 adolescents (52% girls), aged 16 to 21 years (mean, 18.6; SD, 1.16), from the general Flemish population. In 2012, all respondents completed the DAPP-SF-A and the Youth Self-Report as a part of the longitudinal Flemish Study on Parenting, Personality, and Development.
   Results: Internal consistency reliabilities of the lower-order dimensions were acceptable to good (a ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, median=0.85, mean item-rest correlations ranged from 0.44 to 0.67). The lower-order dimensions showed distinctive mean patterns for boys and girls, with higher scores for girls on Affective Instability and Insecure Attachment [effect sizes (d) were both -0.35] and higher scores for boys on all lower-order dimensions of Dissocial Behavior, Inhibitedness, and three lower-order dimensions of Emotional Dysregulation (d ranged from 0.21 to 0.79). The comparison of the Flemish scores with the Dutch scores showed substantial inter-cultural differences (d ranged from 0.13 to -1.78).
   Conclusions: The DAPP-SF-A shows satisfactory reliability in a Flemish community-based sample of adolescents. Furthermore, given the differences between boys and girls, the use of gender-based norms seems appropriate. Finally, substantial differences with the Dutch general population norms warrant the use of separate norms in Flemish adolescents.

TI Impact of the IRC Section 475 Mark-to-Market Election on Bitcoin
   Taxation
SO ATA JOURNAL OF LEGAL TAX RESEARCH
AB IRS Notice 2014-21 provides that virtual convertible currencies, including Bitcoins, be treated as property rather than currency, and the general tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to all related transactions. In this paper, we suggest that the ambiguity created by relying on taxpayer intent/use creates an opportunity for Bitcoin traders to approximate the benefits of foreign currency designation under IRC Section 988 by making the IRC Section 475 mark-to-market (MTM) election. We suggest that the IRC Section 475 MTM election is appropriate for bitcoin traders as it allows them to convert unrealized losses into ordinary deductions and approximate foreign currency tax accounting treatment. We also suggest electing IRC Section 475 provides only marginal benefit to bitcoin dealers by accelerating pre-existing business losses to earlier periods through the mark-to-market adjustment.

TI Blockchain-enabled Intelligent Asset Exchange for a Circular Economy
SO ERCIM NEWS
AB As the notion of circular economy gains momentum, intelligent assets increasingly form the backbone of sustainable ecosystems. Although these assets can supply the necessary knowledge for fueling the value drivers of a circular economy, the generated value will be significantly amplified by allowing third parties to manage them and profit from better asset utilisation. However, for an everchanging networked environment consisting of numerous assets, ownership needs to be dynamic, granular and adaptable in order to maximise gains. Blockchain-based mechanisms can effectively serve this need by enabling transfer of asset ownership directly between parties participating in the circular economy while introducing trust, efficiency and automation in asset exchange contracts.

TI The price of anonymity: empirical evidence from a market for Bitcoin
   anonymization
SO JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY
AB We present the first measurement study of JoinMarket, a growing marketplace for more anonymous transfers in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our study reveals that this market is funded with multiple thousand bitcoins and generated a turnover of almost 29.5 million USD over the course of 13 months. Assessing the resilience of the market against a well-funded attacker, we discover that in a typical scenario, a selective attack with a 90% success rate requires an investment of 14 000-54 000 USD (which is recoverable after the attack). We present economic arguments to explain the existence of this novel market for anonymity and underpin the hypothesis of heterogeneous time preference with empirical data.

AB With the increased use of Internet, governments and large companies store and share massive amounts of personal data in such a way that leaves no space for transparency. When a user needs to achieve a simple task like applying for college or a driving license, he needs to visit a lot of institutions and organizations, thus leaving a lot of private data in many places. The same happens when using the Internet. These privacy issues raised by the centralized architectures along with the recent developments in the area of serverless applications demand a decentralized private data layer under user control.
   We introduce the Private Data System (PDS), a distributed approach which enables self-sovereign storage and sharing of private data. The system is composed of nodes spread across the entire Internet managing local key-value databases. The communication between nodes is achieved through executable choreographies, which are capable of preventing information leakage when executing across different organizations with different regulations in place.
   The user has full control over his private data and is able to share and revoke access to organizations at any time. Even more, the updates are propagated instantly to all the parties which have access to the data thanks to the system design. Specifically, the processing organizations may retrieve and process the shared information, but are not allowed under any circumstances to store it on long term.
   PDS offers an alternative to systems that aim to ensure self-sovereignty of specific types of data through blockchain inspired techniques but face various problems, such as low performance. Both approaches propose a distributed database, but with different characteristics. While the blockchain-based systems are built to solve consensus problems, PDS's purpose is to solve the self-sovereignty aspects raised by the privacy laws, rules and principles.

AB Blockchain's ever increasing size has become a major problem. Bitcoin [7], for example, has grown to 115120 MB as of May 2017, which is roughly 115 GB. This uncontrollable growth of the Blockchain is bound to become an issue in the future, as hard disks may become too small to store the entire Blockchain history and traversing the transactions databases may become increasingly slow. Already, there are lightweight clients in various Blockchain platforms (Bitcoin included), who do not store the entire chain locally but rely on a third party to send them the blocks they need. There are many issues with these clients, mainly security problems, since they go back to trusting a central authority rather than gaining trust from several distributed peers. These clients' knowledge of the Blockchain is solely based on some third party that should be trusted, while the conceptual base for Blockchain is trust distributing.
   In this paper we present two Blockchain abbreviation schemes. The first one is based on the Ethereum [8] project and proposes replacing the full Blockchain with a new Genesis block, which summarizes everyone's account balances at a certain point in time. One possible benefit is to use less communication while still storing the prefix of the old Blockchain (or signature of the Blockchain that can validate a version archived by other participants) in a local archive. Here we trade loss of transaction history for efficiency. Our second contribution is a UNIX based architecture using the file system, for implementing Blockchain. We demonstrate a Blockchain abbreviation technique for this architecture too.

AB The most fundamental purpose of blockchain technology is to enable persistent, consistent, distributed storage of information. Increasingly common are authentication systems that leverage this property to allow users to carry their personal data on a device while a hash of this data is signed by a trusted authority and then put on a blockchain to be compared against. For instance, in 2015, MIT introduced a schema for the publication of their academic certificates based on this principle. In this work, we propose a way for users to obtain assured identities based on face-to-face proofing that can then be validated against a record on a blockchain. Moreover, in order to provide anonymity, instead of storing a hash, we make use of a scheme of Brands to store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs of identity. We also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data by letting users control a secret of their own. We show how our schema can be implemented on Bitcoin's blockchain and how to save bandwidth by grouping commitments using Merkle trees to minimize the number of Bitcoin transactions that need to be sent. Finally, we describe a system in which users can gain access to services thanks to the identity records of our proposal.

AB Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) plays a vital role in various domains, which are home, agricultural, healthcare, tourism, transportation and education. The more of its development, the more we need to consider about its security and privacy issues. In this paper, we consider smart home system (SHS) as a case study. SHS is an integration of home appliances together with sensors to get automatic operations of heating, lighting, air conditioning, home security, health care systems, etc. Moreover, SHS allows homeowner to monitor and perform appliances functions remotely at any instant time via the Internet. Due to the widespread availability and proliferation of the SHS, attackers can impersonate as a homeowner to steal important data (e.g., vital signs) for doing extortion and life threatening. Therefore, in this paper, we present an approach of private Blockchain implementation for SHS to cope of its privacy and security issues. We review Ethereum Blockchain packages for SHS according to its smart contract features for handling access control policy, data storage and data flow management.

AB Blockchain is an emerging backbone technology behind different crypto-currencies. It can also be used for other purposes and areas. There are different scalability issues associated with blockchain. It is important to know the in depth structure of blockchain by identifying common behaviors of the transactions and the effect of these behaviors on the nodes of the network. Dominant set approach can categorize the blockchain transactions into different clusters without mentioning number of clusters in advance. The experimental evaluation of blockchain transactions shows better clustering accuracy of dominant set approach than existing method of central clustering approach.

History has often been written with and for money, and the controversies surrounding it were numerous. Currently, one of those controversies concerns the issue of the emergence and frequent use of the currency in virtual space as a potential alternative to the traditional currency. Starting from the literature dedicated to virtual currency, this paper aims to highlight how the cryptocurrency may constitute an effective response to the demands of the economic environment, taking into account both the opportunities and threats it is subjected to, and the records evoked by the history economic thought adapted to current reality.

AB Blockchain technology is becoming widely used in various areas. While we wanted to gain experience with blockchain technology, we felt that the best way to do that would be to redevelop a project that we were familiar with. A project of this nature needed to be something we had developed that would use the interesting capabilities of blockchain technology and yet would be small enough to be accomplished fairly easily. To this end we chose a homework submission system that we routinely use for our classes. While this project was perhaps not the best fit for the blockchain technology, it none-the-less exercised all the capabilities that we found interesting in a way that made sense from a blockchain point of view. Our experiences have expanded the list of potential problems for which blockchain might be appropriate.

AB The blockchain is a perceptive invention - the discovery of a person or group of people. But since its invention, it has evolved into something greater and present opportunities for tempestuous innovation. Blockchain has tried to allure evreryone across different domains like industrial sector, banking, healthcare, land holdings and even the public and private sector. The blockchain is an imperishable digital log of financial transactions that can be scheduled to record not just efficient transactions but practically everything that holds a price. It enables global business transactions with less conflict and more trust. Blockchain has invented an era into technology in which the digital information can be distributed without being imitated. Bitcoin blockchain is the most popular public blockchain network, with around 10K nodes. The other big cryptocurrency blockchain project is Ethereum. Ethereum however wasn't designed to be a form of currency but instead it is intended to enable "smart contracts". Many cryptocurrencies are built on the top of blockchain, with the most popular being Bitcoin. In this paper we are going to present an overview of the blockchain technology with focus on two most widely used cryptocurrencies and their comparative analysis.

AB We propose a public key infrastructure framework, inspired by modern distributed cryptocurrencies, that allows for tunable key escrow, where the availability of key escrow is only provided under strict conditions and enforced through cryptographic measures. We argue that any key escrow scheme designed for the global scale must be both inert-requiring considerable effort to recover a key-and public-everybody should be aware of all key recovery attempts. To this end, one of the contributions of this work is an abstract design of a proof-of-work scheme that demonstrates the ability to recover a private key for some generic public key scheme. Our framework represents a new direction for key escrow, seeking an acceptable compromise between the demands for control of cryptography on the Internet and the fundamental rights of privacy, which we seek to align by drawing parallels to the physical world.

AB The blockchain technology is gaining momentum because of its possible application to other systems than the cryptocurrency one. Indeed, blockchain, as a de-centralized system based on a distributed digital ledger, can be utilized to securely manage any kind of assets, constructing a system that is independent of any authorization entity. In this paper, we briefly present blockchain and our work in progress, the VMOA blockchain, to secure virtual machine orchestration operations for cloud computing and network functions virtualization systems. Using tutorial examples, we describe our design choices and draw implementation plans.

   Companies
SO NEW TECHNOLOGY, BIG DATA AND THE LAW
SE Perspectives in Law Business and Innovation
AB In the United States, the regulatory authority of government agencies over financial institutions' third-party service providers varies depending on the type of financial institution. The Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may extend their authority over service providers to their supervised institutions. Meanwhile, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) lacks this authority for credit unions. The federal and state agencies that oversee Money Service Businesses (MSBs) also lack this authority. The regulatory authority over MSBs service providers is particularly interesting because of the rise of virtual currency businesses providing an alternative payment rail outside of traditional institutions, allowing small fintech startups to enter into the payment space. This chapter examines federal and state authority over third-party service providers and justifications thereof. It goes on to examine some of the more unique aspects of fintech entrants to the payment space and how their service providers should be treated along with other MSBs. Ultimately, this chapter recommends that private contract law between MSBs and their service providers be used to mitigate the risks in their relationship. Limited resources and duplicative regulatory costs between federal and state agencies as well as the relatively small size of the industry makes it inefficient to directly supervise third-party service providers. However, this chapter does not reject the possibility of future extensions of government authority as the industry and its potential impact over the financial system grows.

AB Throughout history, currencies or money have three different uses: means of exchange, unit of accounting, and store of wealth. People have used different types of currencies at different times throughout history. Commodity currencies represented items which are either mined from the Earth or produced by agriculture such as gold or salt. Fiat currencies are created by decree by a sovereign nation or groups of nations. Complementary currencies have been created by much smaller groups of people to solve problems which cannot be solved by commodity currencies or fiat currencies. For example, in times of economic depression when people attempt to hoard money (store wealth) there is often not enough currency to accommodate a means of exchange. With the advent of blockchains and crypto-currencies, it is now possible to easily create complementary currencies to attempt to solve problems which can not be solved using commodity currencies or fiat currencies. This paper discusses and compares two different architectures which are being used in two independent projects in South Africa to create complementary currencies by using the Ethereum blockchain and crypto-currency in order to encourage corporate excellence. It is important to note that this paper is not about the underlying success or failure of the complementary currencies created by the architectures. The paper is about the architectures themselves.

AB A blockchain is a public ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in which entries are appended. Consensus protocols for tolerating Byzantine faults have received renewed attention because they also address blockchain systems. However, amid the current hype around blockchains, cryptocurrencies, fintech startups, and novel consensus mechanisms, it is sometimes overlooked that assessing and gaining confidence in the resilience of a protocol is a difficult task.
   We argue that developing consensus protocols is similar to engineering cryptographic systems, and that blockchain developers should look towards the established experience in cryptography and security with building trustworthy systems. Otherwise, it might be dangerous to entrust financial value to new protocols. Public discussion, expert reviews, broad validation, and standards recommendations should be employed, following the established practice in cryptography and security.

To address this problem, this study proposes the Blockchain Connected Gateways (BC Gateways) to protect users from providing personal data to IoT devices without user consent. In addition, the gateways store user privacy preferences on IoT devices in the blockchain network. Therefore, this study can utilize the blockchain technology to resolve the disputes of privacy issues. In conclusion, this paper can contribute to improving user privacy and trust in IoT applications with legacy IoT devices.

AB Cryptocurrency platforms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have become more popular due to decentralized control and the promise of anonymity. Ethereum is particularly powerful due to its support for smart contracts which are implemented through Turing complete scripting languages and digital tokens that represent fungible tradable goods. It is necessary to understand whether de-anonymization is feasible to quantify the promise of anonymity. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly being used in online black markets like Silk Road and ransomware like CryptoLocker and WannaCry. In this paper, we propose a model for persisting transactions from Ethereum into a graph database, Neo4j. We propose leveraging graph compute or analytics against the transactions persisted into a graph database.

AB User privacy is an important issue in a blockchain based transaction system. Bitcoin, being one of the most widely used blockchain based transaction system, fails to provide enough protection on users' privacy. Many subsequent studies focus on establishing a system that hides the linkage between the identities (pseudonyms) of users and the transactions they carry out in order to provide a high level of anonymity. Examples include Zerocoin, Zerocash and so on. It thus becomes an interesting question whether such new transaction systems do provide enough protection on users' privacy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective approach for de-anonymizing these transaction systems by leveraging information in the system that is not directly related, including the number of transactions made by each identity and time stamp of sending and receiving. Combining probability studies with optimization tools, we establish a model which allows us to determine, among all possible ways of linking between transactions and identities, the one that is most likely to be true. Subsequent transaction graph analysis could then be carried out, leading to the de-anonymization of the system. To solve the model, we provide exact algorithms based on mixed integer linear programming.
   Our research also establishes interesting relationships between the de-anonymization problem and other problems studied in the literature of theoretical computer science, e.g., the graph matching problem and scheduling problem.

AB Blockchain has attracted great attention as the basis of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but its capabilities extend far beyond that. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize applications because it provides a transparent, immutable, and append-only ledger that can be used to build new decentralized applications. However, it is hard to implement changes to Bitcoin without forking blockchain. As a result, Bitcoin has difficulty in adapting to new demands and extending new functionality.
   The traditional way to introduce new functionality is to modify Bitcoins code base, but which will lead to some problems such as (a) the security of blockchains, (b) the allocation of currency, and (c) the waste of resources. We present a novel design, statechain, which uses Bitcoin blockchain to propagate application log. It can add new functionality without requiring blockchain fork changes from Bitcoin. Statechain enables application nodes to efficiently query the log as well as transfer log between blockchains. We detail how the application nodes achieve application-level consensus at each block. As far as we know, this technology has not been exploited. However, it has a great practical significance that enables the introduction of new functionality safer and makes the development of blockchain-based applications easier. We have used statechain to explore the field of transferring bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies directly between multiple blockchains.

AB Bitcoin is a digital currency based on cryptographic algorithms. All the transactions of this currency are recorded and stored in a publically available database called blockchain. Since, these transactions are available to everyone, bitcoins must be stored in a secured wallet. These bitcoin wallets can be opened only by its secret key. And if once the secret key of the wallet is lost, it cannot be recovered because of the irreversible nature of bitcoin transaction. To root out this problem, Goldfeder et al. [4] proposed a solution of threshold signature scheme compatible with bitcoins signature by using Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) providing security policy of shared control of a wallet in which each player gets only a single share. Considering an important point of priority/weightage of players, Dikshit and Singh [12] first proposed a scheme in which each player is given one or more shares of the secret key according to his weightage/priority. This scheme has a drawback of managing and handling many keys by each player. Suppose a player has weightage w, then he possesses w different shares of secret key. This problem is resolved in the proposed scheme in this paper. We propose a scheme in which all the players get single share and can accomplish the requirements of concept of weightage. We extend the weighted threshold ECDSA scheme in order to realize efficient weighted threshold ECDSA scheme.

AB Proof-of-work (PoW) schemes are cryptographic primitives with numerous applications, and in particular, they play a crucial role in maintaining consensus in cryptocurrency networks. Ideally, a cryptocurrency PoW scheme should have several desired properties, including efficient verification on one hand, and high memory consumption of the prover's algorithm on the other hand, making the scheme less attractive for implementation on dedicated hardware.
   At theUSENIX Security Symposium 2016, Biryukov andKhovratovich presented a new promising PoWscheme called MTP (Merkle Tree Proof) that achieves essentially all desired PoWproperties. As a result, MTP has received substantial attention from the cryptocurrency community. The scheme uses a Merkle hash tree construction over a large array of blocks computed by a memory consuming (memory-hard) function. Despite the fact that only a small fraction of thememory is verified by the efficient verification algorithm, the designers claim that a cheating prover that uses a small amount of memory will suffer from a significant computational penalty.
   In this paper, we devise a sub-linear computation-memory tradeoff attack on MTP. We apply our attack to the concrete instance proposed by the designers which uses the memory-hard function Argon2d and computes a proof by allocating 2 gigabytes of memory. The attack computes arbitrary malicious proofs using less than a megabyte of memory (about 1/3000 of the honest prover's memory) at a relatively mild penalty of 170 in computation. This is more than 55,000 times faster than what is claimed by the designers. The attack requires a one-time precomputation step of complexity 2 64, but its online cost is only increased by a factor which is less than 2 when spending 2 48 precomputation time.
   The main idea of the attack is to exploit the fact that Argon2d accesses its memory in a way which is determined by its previous computations. This allows to inject a small fraction of carefully selected memory blocks that manipulate Argon2d's memory access patterns, significantly weakening its memory-hardness.

AB Government agencies have been slow to adapt to evolving technologies and the increasing use of decentralized, digital currencies for illegal acts. Virtual black markets are spawning rapidly, and just as one gets taken down dozens more appear in its place. Current regulations and methods of law enforcement are outdated and must be reformed and recalibrated in order to keep up with the innovative techniques of virtual black-market administrators and anonymous users. Despite the urgency of such reform, it must be accomplished while maintaining fundamental privacy rights and avoiding inhibiting new technologies. This Note explains how users are able to abuse digital currencies, such as bitcoin, for illegal purposes and analyzes the current methods used to catch these users. It then argues for a reformation of law-enforcement and legislative efforts so that resources may be focused efficiently on addressing the issue.

AB The popularity of Crypto currencies has not gone unnoticed, Bitcoin which is an electronic payment system and Internet money, is a leading crypto currency and continues to grow from being popular amongst the people who have knowledge about this technology, i.e. the developers, investors and tech-savvy enthusiasts and those that don't. If a person wants to use Bitcoin they need to have a Bitcoin wallet which stores the public and private keys used when sending and receiving bitcoins. Most of these Bitcoin wallets were developed for people who have access to technologies such as smart phones, computers and an Internet connection. This paper presents a simplified Short Message Service (SMS) system that can be used by people who do not have access to these technologies. The system was developed as a prototype and tested on a low-end mobile phone to demonstrate its capabilities. It still needs to be enhanced further to enable anyone to use it, e.g. increase the speed of transactions and SMS responses and the use of better security methods.

AB A large number of people earn money in foreign countries and many of them have to send across the money back home in India. For every such transaction, multiple fees could be charged, varying from 3 to 12 percent. In this paper we offer a peer-to-peer settlement solution for such remittance on blockchain at negligible rates. Money transfers can be securely converted into crypto-currencies, which can easily be transferred across nations, and then again converted into local currencies. In this paper, we use Multi-chain for digital assets and peer-to-peer electronic cash systems where transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain. Each block is verified and added to the blockchain (distributed public ledger), which includes all past transactions through a process known as Mining. Mining using CPU is unwise and has high cost of operation. We present an alternative approach using CUBA-enabled Graphics Processing Unit(GPU) for mining. The massively parallel nature of some GPUs majorly increases the mining power.

AB With the emergence of Bitcoin, businesses are focusing on leveraging Bitcoin's blockchain technology to non-cryptocurrency based applications to improve efficiency of the operations. These business applications operate in environments where participants have verified identities; these are called permissioned environments. Blockchain is an immutable and append only distributed ledger that can be utilized for record keeping applications. We observe that when blockchain technology is adapted from permissionless environments to permissioned environments the immutability of blockchain becomes questionable as the end-users may not monitor or store a copy of the blockchain. We propose the use of Keyless Signatures' Infrastructure as an additional mechanism to ensure irreversible and irrefutable proof of block confirmations which acts as a global proof thus preserving long term immutability of blockchain in permissioned environments.

AB Recent attacks on Bitcoin's peer-to-peer (P2P) network demonstrated that its transaction-flooding protocols, which are used to ensure network consistency, may enable user deanonymization-the linkage of a user's IP address with her pseudonym in the Bitcoin network. In 2015, the Bitcoin community responded to these attacks by changing the network's flooding mechanism to a different protocol, known as diffusion. However, it is unclear if diffusion actually improves the system's anonymity. In this paper, we model the Bitcoin networking stack and analyze its anonymity properties, both pre- and post-2015. The core problem is one of epidemic source inference over graphs, where the observational model and spreading mechanisms are informed by Bitcoin's implementation; notably, these models have not been studied in the epidemic source detection literature before. We identify and analyze near-optimal source estimators. This analysis suggests that Bitcoin's networking protocols (both pre- and post-2015) offer poor anonymity properties on networks with a regular-tree topology. We confirm this claim in simulation on a 2015 snapshot of the real Bitcoin P2P network topology.

SO ARCHIVES AND MANUSCRIPTS
AB Recordkeeping professionals build and manage systems that support the creation and maintenance of trustworthy records, however our approach to the design and implementation of such systems has suffered from a lack of innovation and a failure to collaborate effectively with allied disciplines. Contemporary society, politics and Internet culture are producing new models, tools and techniques which open up exciting possibilities for how recordkeeping systems might work, presenting both opportunities and challenges for recordkeeping professionals. In this article, some elements deemed necessary for trustworthy recordkeeping are identified and critically examined in light of the possibilities of participatory cultures, peer-to-peer business and trust through computation, in particular, blockchain technologies. Conclusions are drawn regarding what might be needed in order to adapt current models and practices to build new forms of recordkeeping systems that could enhance the agency of the individual in a networked society.

AB In light of digitalization, customers increasingly share private data through their online behaviors and actions. Yet, customers have become reluctant to share data due to privacy concerns. From a psychological perspective, a reduction of users' perceived risks should result in a higher willingness to share sensitive data. The development of blockchain-supported, multi-part computation thereby represents an interesting novel empirical context to study such willingness to disclose personal data, as such technologies involve a privacy-preserving approach that could not only technically solve privacy issues but also ought to address precisely the user's risk perception. Therefore, we conducted an online experiment with 420 participants to examine the willingness to disclose personal data dependent on different privacy protection mechanisms. A deception based experiment allowed to measure not only user intention, but also real user behavior. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that participants shared similar amounts of personal data for blockchain-supported approaches and standard privacy policies. Even though an aversion to the blockchain system due to its novelty and potentially perceived complexity was not detected. Furthermore, we found that the willingness to share data increased significantly specifically for technically affine people when they were presented with the opportunity to monetize their data. We further discuss the effects of privacy awareness and whether prior knowledge of blockchain technology had a supporting effect for user acceptance.

TI A Decentralized Trusted Timestamping Based on Blockchains
SO IEEJ JOURNAL OF INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS
AB Decentralized trusted timestamping based on blockchains is used to protect a large variety of digital data. At present, in the case of trusted timestamping services, such related information is not included in the OP_RETURN field of a Bitcoin's transaction chain, which has a limited size (40 bytes). When OP RETURN is extended, (e.g., with multiple OP_RETURN fields) the transaction is rejected by the Bitcoin network. We propose storing data in the blockchain by encoding into Bitcoin addresses. The transactions created by the proposed method are similar to the usual transactions; therefore, they will not be rejected. The proposed method expands the storage space to a maximum of N*20 bytes, thereby enabling the storage of additional information (e.g., file names, creator names, and keywords) as well as file hashes. We performed experiments with a picture and its copyright information. We set N = 3, resulting in storage of 60 bytes of data. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method can timestamp a file in an average of 24 min at a possible cost of 0.24 USD. We believe that the proposed method can prove the existence and integrity of a digital file, which is helpful in copyright protection.

AB As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin [1] has ignited much excitement, not only for its novel realization of a central bank-free financial instrument, but also as an alternative approach to classical distributed computing problems, such as reaching agreement distributedly in the presence of misbehaving parties, as well as to numerous other applications. contracts, reputation systems, name services, etc. The soundness and security of these applications, however, hinges on the thorough understanding of the fundamental properties of its underlying blockchain data structure, which parties ("miners") maintain and try to extend by generating "proofs of work" (POW, aka "cryptographic puzzle").
   In this talk we follow the approach introduced in [2], formulating such fundamental properties of the blockchain, and then showing how applications such as consensus and a robust public transaction ledger can be built "on top'' of them. The properties are as follows, assuming the adversary's hashing power (our analysis holds against arbitrary attacks) is strictly less than 1/2 and high network synchrony:
   Common prefix: The blockchains maintained by the honest parties possess a large common prefix. More specifically, if two honest parties "prune" (i.e., cut off) k blocks from the end of their local chains, the probability that the resulting pruned chains will not be mutual prefixes of each other drops exponentially in the that parameter.
   Chain quality: We show a bound on the ratio of blocks in the chain of any honest party contributed by malicious parties. In particular, as the adversary's hashing power approaches 1/2, we show that blockchains are only guaranteed to have few, but still some, blocks contributed by honest parties.
   Chain growth: We quantify the number of blocks that are added to the blockchain during any given number of rounds during the execution of the protocol. (N.B.: This property, which in [2] was proven and used directly in the form of a lemma, was explicitly introduced in [3]. Identifying it as a separate property enables modular proofs of applications' properties.)
   The above properties hold assuming that all parties. honest and adversarial-"wake up" and start computing at the same time, or, alternatively, that they compute on a common random string (the "genesis" block) only made available at the exact time when the protocol execution is to begin. In this talk we also consider the question of whether such a trusted setup/behavioral assumption is necessary, answering it in the negative by presenting a Bitcoinlike blockchain protocol that is provably secure without trusted setup, and, further, overcomes such lack in a scalable way. i.e., with running time independent of the number of parties [4].
   A direct consequence of our construction above is that consensus can be solved directly by a blockchain protocol without trusted setup assuming an honest majority (in terms of computational power).

AB Decentralized ledger-based currencies such as Bitcoin provide a means to construct payment systems without requiring a trusted bank. Removing this trust assumption comes at the significant cost of transaction privacy. A number of academic works have sought to improve the privacy offered by ledger-based currencies using anonymous electronic cash (e-cash) techniques. Unfortunately, this strong degree of privacy creates new regulatory concerns, since the new private transactions cannot be subject to the same controls used to prevent individuals from conducting illegal transactions such as money laundering. We propose an initial approach to addressing this issue by adding privacy preserving policy-enforcement mechanisms that guarantee regulatory compliance, allow selective user tracing, and admit tracing of tainted coins (e.g., ransom payments). To accomplish this new functionality we also provide improved definitions for Zerocash and, of independent interest, an efficient construction for simulation sound zk-SNARKs.

TI THE METHODOLOGY OF DIGITAL SHADOW ECONOMY ESTIMATION
SO E & M EKONOMIE A MANAGEMENT
AB The article introduces a new methodology of digital shadow economy estimation, which is based on the principles of the MIMIC method. This new methodology complements traditional methodologies of shadow economy estimation with such a component as digital shadow economy.
   Our analysis of the most popular today methods of shadow economic estimation proves that, despite some of its drawbacks, the MIMIC model can be treated as the most comprehensive and appropriate method for such calculations since it takes into account both causal and indicators of shadow economy.
   As the causal variables here, as applied to digital shadow economy, we use household access to the Internet and IT overall, the volume of non-cash payments and the use of most advanced financial instruments. While as the indicators of the digital shadow economy spread we use: the volume of non-cash payments at online platforms, the frequency of cryptocurrency payments, and the cost of parcels to which customs duties have not been applied.
   For further empirical verification of the model proposed here, numerical values of both causal variables and indicators would be necessary. Unfortunately, official statistical sources are unable to provide such data in full volume, especially when it comes to cryptocurrencies and other informal payments. Thus, in our further research we plan to not only prove the practical applicability of the offered here model for estimations of digital shadow economy size as well as overall size of shadow economy on the examples of particular countries, but also to accumulate the necessary statistics for such calculations.

AB In Location Based Services (LBSs), service providers can obtain mobile users' locations or traces while receiving their service requests. K-anonymity, which is the most commonly used location privacy protection method, needs the cooperation among mobile users to form a k-anonymous group. Though several incentive mechanisms have been proposed to motivate mobile users to participate in the k-anonymous group, most of them rely on a 'trustful' center. In this paper, we propose a distributed secure incentive mechanism that applies blockchain smart contracts to motivate users for k-anonymity cooperation. To protect the reward transaction information, group encryption and blind collective signature are adopted. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed incentive mechanism.

AB bitcoin is an emerging financial technology that is gaining a lot of popularity all over the world and starting to change the way people make financial transaction. In Indonesia however, bitcoin is more famous for its negative issue, such as money laundering, rather than its usage in financial transaction. One interesting fact to observe is the absence of regulations that explicitly governs the usage of bitcoins. This paper analyzes the factors influencing Indonesian authorities in defining regulations for bitcoins and how the existing regulations left open some opportunities for a bad guy to perform money laundering with the help of bitcoins. A qualitative approach is used in this research for data collection and analysis. Interview with two experts representing bitcoin exchange company and legal consultant was conducted in data collection. The outcome of this research is to find out vulnerabilities in bitcoin that allows money laundering and give suggestions on how to prevent money laundering with bitcoin from the perspective of regulations and bitcoin company in Indonesia.

AB Manuscript submission systems are a central fixture in scholarly publishing. However, with existing systems, researchers must trust that their yet unpublished findings will not prematurely be disseminated due to technical weaknesses and that anonymous peer reviewers or committee members will not plagiarize unpublished content. To address this limitation, we present CryptSubmit - a system that automatically creates a decentralized, tamperproof, and publicly verifiable timestamp for each submitted manuscript by utilizing the blockchain of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The publicly accessible and tamperproof infrastructure of the blockchain allows researchers to independently verify the validity of the timestamp associated with their manuscript at the time of submission to a conference or journal. Our system supports researchers in protecting their intellectual property even in the face of vulnerable submission platforms or dishonest peer reviewers. Optionally, the system also generates trusted timestamps for the feedback shared by peer reviewers to increase the traceability of ideas. CryptSubmit integrates these features into the open source conference management system OJS. In the future, the method could be integrated at nearly no overhead cost into other manuscript submission systems, such as EasyChair, ConfTool, or Ambra. The introduced method can also improve electronic pre-print services and storage systems for research data.

AB Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic payment system where payment transactions are stored in a data structure named the blockchain which is maintained by a community of participants.
   The Bitcoin Core protocol limits blocks to 1 MB in size. Each block contains at most some 4,000 transactions. Blocks are added to the blockchain on average every 10 minutes, therefore the transaction rate is limited to some 7 transactions per second (TPS). This is much less than the transaction rate offered by competing financial transaction processing systems.
   The Bitcoin TPS can be increased by increasing the block size and/or by decreasing the block discovery interval. Both of these interventions will increase the end-to-end block transmission delay, which in turn will increase the probability that different participants momentarily record different versions of the blockchain, so that the consensus protocol will discard an increasing number of blocks. The net effect is that the real increase in the TPS is not proportional to the increase (decrease) in the block size (block discovery rate).
   Our simulation experiments show that large block sizes, if accompanied by large end-to-end block transmission delays, give rise to the frequent appearance of inconsistent blockchain copies, to the detriment of the TPS. We present a simulation analysis of Bitcoin-Next Generation where blocks (keyblocks) stripped of transactions propagate rapidly through the peer-to-peer network. Once a keyblock is mined, only the miner of the keyblock is entitled to broadcast small microblocks of transactions until the next keyblock is mined and another miner is selected to broadcast microblocks. Initial simulation experiments show that Bitcoin-NG can sustain substantially larger transaction rates than Bitcoin Core.

(b) Tools: the SL-Algorithm (SLA) automatically extracts the top groups of nodes with similar connectivity, finds groups of shared connectivity and detects suspicious behaviour in a graph. (c) Discoveries: Experiments on several real-world networks illustrate the effectiveness of SLA. Observations from synthetic and real-world networks reveal relations between spectral and graph properties. We show that SLA is highly scalable and linear on the size of a graph. Analyzing a graph with over 2 million edges takes less than 5 minutes. Overall, SL provides an easy-to-use tool for practitioners to explain a weighted and directed graph quickly, to understand its connectivity and identify regular and anomalous behaviors.

AB Modern critical infrastructures are increasingly targeted by highly sophisticated cyber attacks and are protected by increasingly complex tools. Cyber analysts face many challenges finding relevant information in large, complex data sets, and require novel distributed detection and reaction methodologies based on secured transaction techniques. These technologies should automatically analyse incident report and share analysis result in secure way between critical infrastructure stakeholders to achieve better situational awareness. Our goal is to provide solutions in real-time that could replace human input for cyber incident analysis tasks (Triage) to remove false positives and to eliminate irrelevant information. The effective and fast warning system should support cyber analyst to establish cyber situational awareness, and allow analysts to promptly respond in case of an attack. In this paper we evaluate the application of so-called "smart contracts" to an incident warning system and assess its accuracy and performance. We demonstrate how the presented techniques can be applied to support incident handling tasks performed by security operation centers. We show that a real-time "smart contracts" solution can replace human input for a large number of threat intelligence analysis tasks.

AB The dynamic complexity in companies as well as between companies and the market has grown strongly in recent years. This type of complexity can no longer be adequately understood with the existing management methods. Complexity reduction, although necessary, leads, in particular, to the neglect of dynamic facts, with the consequence that static and simple methods are predominantly used at companies' top-management levels. This can have far-reaching consequences for strategic decisions, such as the development of business models. Executives must learn to accept and master a higher degree of complexity.
   This research develops a conceptual, theory-based cybernetic company simulation model. The research operationalizes the company as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). A DAO is an organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. There are several examples of this type of business in reality. The precise legal status of this organization is unclear. I use a computer simulation-based DAO which allows experimentation under controlled laboratory conditions so that students can experiment with this type of organization. This research is a first attempt to design a DAO as a computer simulation-based model with the purpose of in-vitro experimentation and education.
   By replacing the real system with a computer-assisted simulation model, experiments can be carried out in socio-economic systems and their effects on success-critical variables can be investigated. The prerequisite is an internally and externally valid and transparent company model in order to implement the effects identified in the DAO into the real system. The simulated DAO offers the opportunity to improve the development of business models and to evaluate the short and medium-term valuation of business models in advance. This contribution positions the computer simulation-based DAO as a cybernetic company model and demonstrates its usefulness. The research discusses the results and ends with paths for for future research.

AB The article 1 aims to study the MCIN modeling method and design the MCIN-based architecture of smart agriculture (MCIN-ASA) which is different from current vertical architecture and involves production, management and commerce. Architecture is composed of three MCIN-ASA participants which are MCIN-ASA enterprises, individuals and commodity. In addition, architecture uses enterprises and individuals personalized portals as the carriers which are linked precisely with each other through a peer-to-peer network called six-degrees-of-separation block-chain. The authors want to establish a self-organization, open and ecological operational system which includes active, personalized consumption, direct, centralized distribution, distributed and smart production. The paper models three main MCIN-ASA participants, design the smart supply, demand and management functions, which shows the feasibility innovation and high efficiency of implementing MCIN on agriculture. The authors think that MCIN-ASA improves current agriculture greatly, and inspires a lot in production-marketing-combined electronic commerce.

AB Everyday number of smart devices or IOT devices either it be a smart phone, tablet, smart home device or any wearable technology are being connected to the internet. These IOT devices have become an essential part of our everyday life. We use them in many forms without being aware that we have started depending on them like for security purpose we use security systems in our house, or the smarts locks on our doors to keep our self-safe from the moon lighters. But do we really consider our security that seriously. Today IOT device security has become one of the major concern of the IT Industry. In this paper, we are using the block chain technique to develop a framework for security and management of data on the internet. We have developed a framework which shows how smart devices communicate with each other with block chain posing as the backbone. The framework serves as a scalable and robust solution, in order to address identity and security concerns of IOT. The proposed framework is further compared to existing models.

AB Increasingly digital technology in the present helped many people lives. Unlike the electoral system, there are many conventional uses of paper in its implementation. The aspect of security and transparency is a threat from still widespread election with the conventional system (offline). General elections still use a centralized system, there is one organization that manages it. Some of the problems that can occur in traditional electoral systems is with an organization that has full control over the database and system, it is possible to tamper with the database of considerable opportunities.
   Blockchain technology is one of solutions, because it embraces a decentralized system and the entire database are owned by many users. Blockchain itself has been used in the Bitcoin system known as the decentralized Bank system. By adopting blockchain in the distribution of databases on e-voting systems can reduce one of the cheating sources of database manipulation. This research discusses the recording of voting result using blockchain algorithm from every place of election. Unlike Bitcoin with its Proof of Work, this thesis proposed a method based on a predetermined turn on the system for each node in the built of blockchain.

AB The blockchain is a distributed ledger shared among computers around the world that allowing anyone to transact and do business with each other. Once a new block is created, ledger's transactions are updated and synchronized. Hence, the speed of information propagation in order to minimize the time taken by a node to verify a block before announcing it to the network is very significant that should be leveraged by the enabling technologies. However, due to the huge of data capacity needed, mode division multiplexing (MDM) is a promising approach to provide an additional level of freedom through propagating different channels in multimode fiber (MMF). Nevertheless, mode coupling is considered as the primary bandwidth impairment of MMF due to the mode's random perturbation. This paper investigates the potential of mode spacing in conjunction with a feed-forward equalizer on twisted Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) MDM. Free error transmission of 40Gbit/s over MMF is achieved. The bit-error-rate and eye diagram have been used as a measurement metrics.

AB Payment methods and habits are evolving over time, as a result of technological innovation and commercial development. China, where paper money was invented more than 1000 years ago, is no exception to this. This chapter looks into the ongoing evolution of payment instruments in mainland China, and the interest and role of the central bank. It finds that, in recent years, the use of non-cash payment instruments has been growing rapidly, driven by commercial, technological and regulatory developments, as well as by changing customer needs. In this dynamic environment, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) ensures an orderly development and the safety and efficiency of payment arrangements via regulations, the oversight of payment systems, instruments and service providers, as well as by providing payment infrastructure itself, such as the Internet Banking Payment System. With it, the PBoC responds not only to the rapid growth of Internet and mobile payments, but also to the increasing demand for instant payments, which is a global trend. The next technological shift might be a gradual one from electronic to digital money. In this area, the PBoC is also active, by overseeing and regulating Bitcoin and assessing digital currencies in general, including the potential issuance of a digital Yuan.

AB As currently understood and used, "smart contracts" are merely a means to execute the terms of a full legal contract. This paper, however, proposes the creation of a semantic legal layer to support blockchain based legal contracts. Some of the primary challenges to such an implementation, including the need to develop robust, jurisdiction-specific legal ontologies, and develop means to preserve the evidentiary character of records leading up and proving contract formation, are considered. Particular attention is given to the particular challenges posed and purposes behind the use of legal language in contract drafting, with consideration of ways to utilize distributed ledger and linked data technology to leverage that specialist language for a broader base of contracting parties.

The blockchain technology and the concept of blockchain immutability is discussed. The benefits of early standardization of the blockchain technology are argued based on the literature and the analysis of the central blockchain immutability characteristic. From this, a framework is proposed aimed at understanding the dimensions and boundaries of blockchain immutability. The resulting framework is suggested as a good practice standard for the implementation of blockchain systems. Based on these efforts, the article supports initiatives to better exploit the blockchain technology's full potential by standardization.

AB Blockchain was first implemented in Bitcoin, the first decentralized digital currency, with the hash-chained blocks of data, hash-based proof-of-work, and a peer-to-peer protocol to reach consensus so as to append new blocks and secure transactions. Most importantly, it prevents double-spending after some confirmation time. However, few countries accept Bitcoin as a legal currency because, in addition to being subject to some security attacks, there are still problems in economics, politics, performance, etc. Many altcoins with different improvements have been proposed, but problems and attacks still remain. Meanwhile, blockchain, as a trust machine, has been applied to many other areas, such as smart contract, creating a new hype, called "the most significant innovation since the Internet." However, there are still similar problems and attacks in those applications. By changing the original consensus design, instead of just providing proof of work, we propose EPoW, i.e. estimable proof-of-work, to estimate how much work is done and a corresponding protocol to reach consensus. EPoW and the protocol can serve as a new instrument such that the problems and attacks mentioned above might be relaxed or solved economically. With EPoW, we believe blockchains and digital currencies can be better customized by companies, organizations or countries for different purposes or policies and be employed by any users.

AB Great concerns have arisen due to the increasing research of block chain application in internet finance. However, there appears to have many research prospects in this area according to China's present development situation. In most studies of research, block chain technology is in the theoretical stage, practice still needed. At home and abroad, block chain technology has been gradually put into use, but there are no complete landing application results. From the development point of view, the future of technology conversion still takes a long time of practice. This paper is intended to analyze the development of block chain in internet finance in order to illustrate its future's development prospect. The greatest emphasis has been on the influence of block chain application in internet finance. The methods used in this study are known as comparison method and graphic method. Studies have shown that block chain will reconstruct internet financial governance mechanism and block chain technology is a useful tool for internet shared finance. The findings of the research have led to the conclusion that the road of block chain application in internet finance in china and abroad is still long and implications in this area still needs being pushed on. Suggestions were made for further study of block chain in internet finance.

AB The modern age and exponential development of technology induce currency changes that pretend to root out paper money and replace it with a virtual, digital currency. Bitcoin is the most used viral currency today, the value of which is steadily increasing through a comparison with fiat currencies. Accordingly, the interest of clients in this crypto currency is growing around the world together with the domain of their application.
   It is the analysis of possibilities and limitations of the use of digital money, as potentially new currency of modern society that the subject of this research paper is based on. Bearing in mind that digital money is still not accepted as a relevant payment instrument, the basic problem of the paper is to determine the link between the development of the world countries and the speed of implementation of digital money in the payment system in the territory of the Republic of Serbia.
   The aim is to discover the existing level, but also predict future spheres of digital money application. In order to obtain adequate research results, scientific methods of analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, and comparison were used in the research to predict the future domains of the use of crypto currencies. Subsequently, general conclusions about the potential of Serbia as an area for the application of digital currencies are drawn, based on the comparison of the use of these currencies on a global scale.
   The research results aim to raise awareness of the application of digital currencies, which define the frameworks of the new economy at the global level. In this way, the business structure is being shifted towards virtual currencies, since 70% of total cash transactions are done through some form of non-cash payment.

AB Recent years have witnessed the trend of increasingly relying on distributed infrastructures. This increased the number of reported incidents of security breaches compromising users' privacy, where third parties massively collect, process and manage users' personal data. Towards these security and privacy challenges, we combine hierarchical identity based cryptographic mechanisms with emerging blockchain infrastructures and propose a blockchain-based data usage auditing architecture ensuring availability and accountability in a privacy-preserving fashion. Our approach relies on the use of auditable contracts deployed in blockchain infrastructures. Thus, it offers transparent and controlled data access, sharing and processing, so that unauthorized users or untrusted servers cannot process data without client's authorization. Moreover, based on cryptographic mechanisms, our solution preserves privacy of data owners and ensures secrecy for shared data with multiple service providers. It also provides auditing authorities with tamper-proof evidences for data usage compliance.

AB If a blockchain is well-implemented, the resulting advantages include speed, privacy, reliability, and much lower costs. As more global enterprises adopt blockchain technology, it is necessary to evaluate and address not only benefits but the associated risks too. Effective solutions can be proposed based on the analysis of potential risks in the used blockchain ecosystem by its modelling.
   In the paper, the approach for risk modelling of blockchain ecosystem is described. Practical realization of simulation on the base of Petri Net model is proposed. Process of E-net model design for analysis of blockchain platform and critical aspects of a blockchain solution includes the next main components: formal construction of the individual blocks process formation in the blockchain; formal construction for transformation probability of various possible risks in the blockchain ecosystem into the generator of risk events; formal metamodeling of blockchain operation with critical aspects of a blockchain solution; base set of modelling elements for above-mentioned transformation procedure; and software tools for simulation experiment. The detailed rules for design of Petri Net model are proposed and used structure of ATM communication network is performed.

AB If, as most experts agree, the mathematical basis of major blockchain systems is (probably if not provably) sound, why do they have a bad reputation? Human misbehavior (such as failed Bitcoin exchanges) accounts for some of the issues, but there are also deeper and more interesting vulnerabilities here. These include design faults and code-level implementation defects, ecosystem issues (such as wallets), as well as approaches such as the "51% attack" all of which can compromise the integrity of blockchain systems. With particular attention to the emerging non-financial applications of blockchain technology, this paper demonstrates the kinds of attacks that are possible and provides suggestions for minimizing the risks involved.

AB The blockchain constitutes a technology-based, rather than social or regulation based, means to lower uncertainty about one another in order to exchange value. However, its use may very well also lead to increased complexity resulting from having to subsume work that displaced intermediary institutions had performed. We present our perspective that smart contracts may be used to mitigate this increased complexity. We further posit that smart contracts can be delineated according to complexity: Smart contracts that can be verified objectively without much uncertainty belong in an inter-organizational context; those that cannot be objectively verified belong in an intra-organizational context. We state that smart contracts that implement a formal (e.g. mathematical or simulation) model are especially beneficial for both contexts: They can be used to express and enforce inter-organizational agreements, and their basis in a common formalism may ensure effective evaluation and comparison between different infra organizational contracts. Finally, we present a case study of our perspective by describing Intellichain, which implements formal, agent-based simulation model as a smart contract to provide epidemiological decision support.

AB As the IoT technology continues to grow, it needs to support an increasing range of services. Therefore, IoT networking over which services are provided has become an area of great importance. In particular, the management of IoT resources and the way new technology integrates into the network operator's infrastructure is critical to the success of IoT. The key to supporting a large number of services is IoT system resource. Therefore, all performance guarantees in IoT systems are conditional on currently available resource capacity. In this chapter, we focus our attention on the IoT resource allocation problem. First, an effective bandwidth allocation algorithm for heterogeneous networks is introduced. And then, a new Bitcoin mining protocol with the incentive payment process is explained. To share the computation resource, this Bitcoin protocol adopts the concept of the group bargaining solution by considering a peer-to-peer relationship.

AB Bitcoin time series dataset recording individual transactions denominated in Euro at the COINBASE market between April 23, 2015 and August 15, 2016 is analyzed. Markov switching model is applied to classify the regions of varying volatility represented by three hidden state regimes using univariate autoregressive model and dependent mixture model. Causality extraction and price prediction of daily BTCEUR exchange rates is performed by means of a recurrent neural network using the standard Elman model. Strong correlations is found between the normalized mean squared error of the Elman network (out-of-sample 5-day-ahead prediction) and the realized volatility (sum of minute returns squared throughout the trading day). The present approach is calibrated using simulated regime change in standard econometric models. Our results clearly demonstrate the applicability of recurrent neural networks to causality extraction even in the case of highly volatile cryptocurrency exchange rate time series data.

TI Opportunities and Barriers for Application of Distributed Ledgers in the
   Context of EU Digital Single Market Strategy
SO EUROPEAN INTEGRATION STUDIES
AB Decentralization, on one hand, brings more transparency and trust to the parties involved in transactions, but on the other hand, it narrows possibilities for central control. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) is a recent decentralized innovation in the field of information and communication technology (ICT) that acts as self-sustainable ledger for documenting transactions self-protected against counterfeiting and hacker attacks. The aim of the current research paper is to reveal opportunities and barriers for utilization of distributed ledgers in the context of EU digital single market strategy. The main tasks are (1) to analyze functionality dynamics of existing distributed ledgers, (2) to analyze utilization areas of distributed ledgers, (3) to analyze digital trends related to utilization of distributed ledgers within the EU. The current research paper utilizes methods of content analysis, grounded theory, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The research has revealed that half of EU Digital Single Market priorities can be facilitated through distributed ledgers.

AB Micro-generation promises to greatly contribute to the energy balance of the energy grid; however, so far, its market penetration is going slow due to the few, or not-existing, direct economic benefits end-users would enjoy by deploying an in-house micro-generation system. In this paper, taking advantage of the potentialities of blockchain technologies, we propose a solar energy production and distribution architecture using smart contracts, a particular distributed ledger paradigm, to support automatic energy exchanges and auctions, potentially enabling a new, open and more fruitful, under an end-user perspective, energy micro-generation market. We present the conceptual design of the approach, as well the energy grid prototype and the control layer, running on the Ethereum platform. The proposed architecture has been implemented and validated through an in-house developed test-bed.

AB Credible reputation lies at the core of users and devices communicating and transacting successfully. Identity fraud is becoming increasingly difficult to manage in the face of massive-scale database breaches. In critical infrastructure and public safety applications, as well as day-to-day personal and business transactions, it is imperative to have a significant degree of confidence in whom/what one communicates with - whether to know if the recipient can be entrusted with the sender's data, or if the sender's data is to be considered reliably sourced. Even where possible, lost reputation is substantially more cumbersome, time-consuming and expensive to replace than are compromised, stolen or defective devices and their embedded cryptographic keys. This paper focuses on two methodologies that have considerable implications relative to addressing the reputation issue: (1) blockchain-enabled anomaly detection and assessment that involves dynamically asserted identity at the network edge effected through end-user targeted release of trusted behavioral data; (2) IoT and human interaction that is securely facilitated through use of an "Inviter-Invitee" protocol to set up dedicated maintainable "communication lines." The judiciously applied combination of the cryptographic protocol suites that enable the two methodologies results in a practicably implementable system for smart city use cases.

AB The IoT presents opportunities in all industrial sectors and is integral to the future of goods and services. The IoT includes the old Internet, but is substantially different from the old Internet for at least one very simple reason: the devices at the periphery of the network are not operated by people. These devices may be semi-or fully automated. And they will vastly outnumber the human operated devices in a short period of time. Blockchain is the basis technology for crypto-currencies like Bitcoin. But Blockchain can have far larger applications in the IoT, because Blockchain is highly distributed and publically viewable system of sequentially linked cryptographically. This in turn means that the Blockchain can be used to build trusted connections without an intermediary. This paper presents a concept of application.

AB Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency based in peer-to-peer network that uses a blockchain. To maintain the blockchain without trusted third parties, a player called a miner proves that he has completed a proof-of-work. As the difficulty of proof-of-work is increasing, mining pools, consisting of a number of miners, have become major players compared with solo miners. Most mining pools consist of a manager and miners. All miners who belong to a mining pool submit their shares to the manager and get paid in proportion to the amount of their shares. Therefore, the manager has to pay all miners fairly.
   However, many Bitcoin mining pools were ruined by an attack called the Duplicate Share Attack (DSA) in 2015. In this paper, we analyze DSA in multiple directions. First, we mathematically analyze DSA against one mining pool and multiple mining pools. As results of our analyses, we derive the optimal attacker's strategy, which shows that DSA can give a large extra profit to an attacker with little computational power. Because the duplicate share vulnerability has been already fixed in a few large mining pools after DSA was introduced, DSA may not be considered a threat any more. However, we show that several small mining pools are still vulnerable to DSA and an attacker can unfairly earn a large extra profit using these unpatched small mining pools. In summary, we argue that honest miners in Bitcoin network are not yet free from DSA.

TI Blockchain and Social Macroevolution
SO INFORMACIOS TARSADALOM
AB Bitcoin madness, the boom of the crypto economy, a new gold rush - if we let ourselves be influenced by the mood of these news headlines it might make us feel like we are in the early nineties with the dotcom boom repeating itself again along with the threat of a breaking bubble that finally happened. If we rather opt to examine the core blockchain technology that underlies these headlines, it might lead to something with real significance: the transaction system between two sides without an intermediary (state - financial institution) involved is set to change significantly as there is a technological solution that can guarantee cheaper transactions that are more secure and directly carried out between the parties. This may lead to a major change in society that is only comparable to urbanization and the evolution of hierarchical societies 10,000-12,000 years ago. According to our view, this aspect makes the real / possible social effects of blockchain open to interpretation by the theory, definitions and terms of social macroevolution. A large part of the puzzle is not yet finished, but a decentralized public blockchain may lead to a new era of social control over transactions. In this study, we revisit the basics of the Blockchain World, its history, recent developments and its social, political and historical context.

AB In December 2013 the People's Bank of China announced the restriction of Bitcoin from being involved in any services offered by financial institutions in China, fearing that the speculative risks inherent in Bitcoin is too new for Chinese investors and may endanger the national financial system. This article reviews the Bitcoin's evolvement both as currency and as investment asset around the world. Also, the regulatory treatment for Bitcoin in America is discussed. Then I used detrended ratios to compare the volatility of Bitcoin market and China's stock market, concluding that the risks inherent in Bitcoin are not unacceptable for Chinese investors. Moreover, I searched into the relationship between Bitcoin return and some fundamental economic variables, finding that Bitcoin doesn't have enough correlation with the national economic system to depress investors further during an economic downturn and that Bitcoin actually has excellent diversification benefit as portfolio component.

AB In order to fully consider the impact of future policies and technologies on the electricity sales market, improve the efficiency of electricity market operation, realize the dual goal of power reform and energy saving and emission reduction, this paper uses multi-level decision theory to put forward the double-layer game model under the consideration of ETS and block chain. We set the maximization of electricity sales profit as upper level objective and establish a game strategy model of electricity purchase; while we set maximization of user satisfaction as lower level objective and build a choice behavior model based on customer satisfaction. This paper applies the strategy to the simulation of a sales company's transaction, and makes a horizontal comparison of the same industry competitors as well as a longitudinal comparison of game strategies considering different factors. The results show that Double-layer game model is reasonable and effective, it can significantly improve the efficiency of the electricity sales companies and user satisfaction, while promoting new energy consumption and achieving energy-saving emission reduction.

AB Bitcoin is a digital cryptocurrency operating on a peer to peer network, which is currently integrated across a number of businesses and exchange markets. New bitcoins is created by participants who contribute computational resources to maintain a public blockchain as miners. Miners collaborate in a mining pool to reduce their variance and earn steadier rewards in Bitcoin. Each mining pool desires to make a profit in the competition against others. To this end, an intelligent mining strategy to enable a mining pool to attain higher probability to get rewards disproportional to its computational power is proposed in this paper. We deploy some forwarding nodes according to the distribution of Bitcoin nodes. This strategy can reduce time delay for messages propagation and increase the probability for new block to be appended on the longest blockchain. It is also easy to deploy in existing network with low expenditure.

AB Bitcoin is decentralized cryptocurrency which has recently become increasingly popular all over the world. Blockchain works as a public ledger to record all transactions in Bitcoin system. A transaction to transfer bitcoins includes a set of inputs and outputs, with its unique hash value. However, the owners of transferred bitcoins can only sign on the transaction to provide integrity for its content without guarantee for its output script. This is considered as transaction malleability in Bitcoin system, which allows an attacker to intercept, modify, and rebroadcast a transaction into the Bitcoin network. This attack deceives the transaction issuer into believing that the original transaction failed to be recorded in blockchain. The vulnerability has been utilized by attackers leading a bankruptcy of the largest Bitcoin exchange at that time. To avoid this situation happens again, we present an efficient strategy to secure user wallet in this paper. Our scheme confirms success of a transaction not only relying on its unique hash value, but also relying on the address balance it spends. This strategy doesn't add too much complexity and is easy to implement in existing wallets. It is resistant to transaction malleability and helps Bitcoin users to protect their property from malicious entities.

AB For the sake of protecting users' privacy from the malicious data which is shared by other people and leasing the pressure of the clouds, an approach of verification based on the Blockchain is put forward in our article. By using the Blockchain to record the hash value and other necessary information of data sharing by other people, we can guarantee that the data user received from a third-party source (such as a cloud storage platform) is the original uploaded data indeed. After taking some experiments on the following method. We confirm that it can be easily distinguished whether a data has been modified by malicious people through our Blockchain-based approach. This Blockchain-based approach of verification can effectively help users find out if the data received is the one exactly he wants. In addition, our approach will imply that the data is not the original one and that data cannot be opened or executed.

AB In recent years certification authorities (CAs) have been the target of multiple attacks due to their sensitive role in internet security. In fact, with access to malicious certificates it is possible to mount effective large-scale man-in-the-middle attacks that may become very vicious, especially if the incident is not properly handled. Many attacks, such as the 2011 ones against DigiNotar and Comodo, also show strong hints of state sponsorship; thus, CAs have to be considered primary targets in a scenario of (possibly state-sponsored) large-scale cyber attacks. Therefore, there is a need for a PKI protocol which is more resilient and without single points of failure, such as the CAs. The BIX protocol is a blockchain-based protocol that allows distribution of certificates linking a subject with their public key, hence providing a service similar to that of a PKI but without the need for a CA. In this paper, we analyse the security of the BIX protocol in a formal way. First, we identify formal security assumptions which are well-suited to this protocol. Second, we present some attack scenarios against the BIX protocol. Third, we provide formal security proofs that these attacks are not feasible under our previously established assumptions.

AB Since the global financial crisis in 2008 had caused the global economic depression, the public were commonly losing confidence in monetary system and international fund associations. Thus, the concept of untraditional currency exchange was developed. Nakamoto (2008) designed bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency which is launched and traded on the Internet. Bitcoin is being gradually accepted by the public, which is attributed to the feature of decentralization and anonymity. The exchange rate of bitcoin reached to the peak price at $4425.30 USD on August 16th, 2017. However, due to the concern of the security challenges such as being stolen, the public lost the confidence of bitcoin and had a conservative attitude toward bitcoin. It also shows that the relevant technical application and transaction model of bitcoin still need to be improved.
   This research attempted to investigate the key factors that prompt users to adopt bitcoin through a two-phase analysis. First, the literature and main social media data were reviewed to list out the key phrases. Second, OpView Social Listening Platform was adopted to collect data, and social network content mining method and the key phrases mentioned above were used to analyze the data from social media forum open to Taiwan. This explored the users' opinions and positive and negative emotional attitude about the latest bitcoin breaking news. This research is expected to provide references for the users when considering adopting bitcoin. It is expected to compare and analyze the data from other countries in the future.

The proposed distributed platform is fully compatible with the existing distribution grid infrastructure. Case studies demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed Bit-Energy platform under various operating conditions. The distributed platform contained in this paper can apply to many other smart grid applications.

AB Asymmetric cryptography algorithms such as RSA are widely used in applications such as blockchain technology and cloud computing to ensure the security and privacy of data. However, the encryption and decryption operations of asymmetric cryptography algorithms involve many computation-intensive multiplications, which require high memory bandwidth and involve large performance and resource overhead. Emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as racetrack memory are regarded to be promising for all levels of memory hierarchy to reduce the area and power overhead due to their high data density and nearly zero leakage. In this paper, we propose an efficient racetrack memory based in-memory design to accelerate the modular multiplication for asymmetric cryptography algorithms. A novel two-stage scalable modular multiplication algorithm is proposed to significantly improve the delay. An efficient architecture is further developed to reduce the number of required adders by half. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme improves the energy efficiency by 45.9%, the area efficiency by 93.6% and achieves 8x of throughput per area compared with the state-of-the-art CMOS-based implementation.

AB An increasing interest on cryptocurrencies has recently raised, in particular on bitcoin. A unique feature of this system is that the list of all the economic transactions is publicly available. This makes available a large amount of information that can be analysed to discover the topological properties of the transaction graph and to obtain insights in the behaviour of the users. In a previous work we have presented a first set of analyses of the bitcoin network. Among other properties of the network, these analyses have also revealed a set of unusual patterns in the bitcoin users graph. We conjecture that these topological patterns are due to artificial users behaviors, not strictly related to normal economic interaction. In particular, in this paper, we analyse the outliers in the in-degree distribution of the bitcoin users graph. The results of our analysis support our conjecture, i.e. they are due to artificial transaction patterns.

AB To improve the efficiency of state management, a system of distributed situational centers (SDSC) is being created. In the article authors examined the problems of development and introduction of situational centers (SC) as components of SDSC, and in particular they paid attention to the problem of interaction and data exchange. The main goal of the work is the development of SDSC creation technology, which is to solve the problem of interaction of nodes, increase the design speed of a particular SC. Various solutions to these problems are taken into consideration. Authors proposed an approach for the creation of SDSC as a decentralized peer-to-peer, fault-tolerant network, in which nodes are unified situational centers. For the design of such a SC, it is proposed to use the data model of the "categories of entities and relations" and the model of the unified virtual work environment. The possibility of using blockchain technology for organizing a common secure data warehouse and consensus building algorithms for resolving conflicts between network nodes is examined.

AB In the paper "On the Complexity of Scrypt and Proofs of Space in the Parallel Random Oracle Model" (Eurocrypt 2016) Joel Alwen et al. focused on proving a lower bound of the complexity of a general problem that underlies both proofs of space protocols [Dziembowski et al. CRYPTO 2015] as well as data-dependent memory-hard functions like scrypt - a key-derivation function that is used e.g. as proofs of work in cryptocurrencies like Litecoin.
   In that paper the authors introduced a sequence gamma(n) and conjectured that this sequence is upper bounded by a constant. Alwen et al. proved (among other results) that the Cumulative Memory Complexity of the hash function scrypt is lower bounded by Omega(n(2)/(gamma(n)center dot log(2) (n))). If the sequence gamma(n) is indeed bounded by a constant then this lower bound can be simplified to Omega(n(2)/log(2)(n)).
   In this paper we first show that gamma(n) > c root log(n) and then we strengthen our result and prove that gamma(n) >= root n/poly(log(n)) .
   Alwen et al. introduced also a weaker conjecture, that is also sufficient for their results - they introduced another sequence Gamma(n) and conjectured that it is upper bounded by a constant. We show that this conjecture is also false, namely: Gamma(n) >= c root log(n).

Here, in contrast, the concept of a mid-price based on an Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) data structure is proposed as a prediction target and shown to be a significantly easier target to forecast, suggesting previous works have attempted to extract predictive power from OHLC data in the wrong context. A prediction framework incorporating a factor discovery and mining process is developed using Randomised Decision Trees, with Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks subsequently demonstrating remarkable predictive capabilities of up to 50.73% better than random (75.42% accuracy) on hourly data based on the FGBL German Bund futures contract, and 42.5% better than random (72.04% accuracy) on a comparison Bitcoin dataset.

AB Blockchain - software technology used for peer-to-peer transaction platforms - is being increasingly applied to alternative opportunities for a variety of industries and use cases such as also in the energy sector. As of now all energy related to blockchain applications are still in a concept stage. This paper aims to present the preliminary ideas of a research project that we have launched in collaboration with a small Fintech company: the Crypto-Trading project. From a research perspective we have explored how a blockchain-based system integrating smart contract functionality can be used to share energy in order to promote smart grids for the management of electricity in the Sardinia Region. From a technical perspective the project will implement a modular blockchain-based software platform for extending the features of cryptocurrency exchanges to the renewable Energy Market, including a robo-advisor which will suggest prosumers the best selling strategy. Blockchain technology shows a lot of promise. In our opinion this might boost the growth of renewable energy production and consequently also have a positive effect on the regional economy.

TI Blockchain and Sensor-Based Reputation Enforcement for the Support of
   the Reshoring of Business Activities
SO RESHORING OF MANUFACTURING: DRIVERS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHALLENGES
SE Measuring Operations Performance
AB A common ground for many small businesses which are based and operate in Europe, capable today of standing against the waves of the globalization and the online economy, is the added value given by: (a) the quality of their services/products, and, (b) the trust they receive from their customers. Interestingly, such businesses are capable, in many cases, of maintaining the fidelity of a customer base, which is willing to pay more for their services or products when compared to what it would be paying when resorting to other channels. Such competitive advantage may be maintained as long as the quality of such services is high, one of the key factors that may also encourage and sustain the reshoring of many businesses to Europe. However, the quality of the products of many businesses is often hard to detect for a customer. Many exemplar cases may be individuated in organic farming and sustainable fashion and textiles. For instance, an average buyer may experience a very hard time when trying to distinguish at first sight an apple which has been obtained following organic protocols from one that has been produced following industrial procedures (e.g., use of chemical fertilizers). The same can be said for clothes, how may a consumer say whether given ethical rules and quality standards have been employed while weaving, knitting, felting, and braiding textiles? Because of these problems, in order to guarantee customers no malicious exploitations have been perpetrated, many of such companies resort to centralized and private certification programs. Unfortunately such certification programs can be expensive, long to implement, and even dishonestly exploited. In this scenario, we propose an integrated approach, based on two distinct and well-known ICT technologies, the Blockchain principle and sensor platforms, as a practical solution to preserve trust, increase the value of products and/or services and hence to encourage the reshoring of business activities. In particular, the model we here propose well applies to those business sectors whose actors share some type of immaterial asset related to the values that they convey with their products, which also, in many cases, represents their shared vulnerability point. Two exemplar business sectors where the proposed approach may be applied are represented by organic and sustainable productions in addition to all those which benefit from their association with specific geographical areas whose products, for given categories, are highly valued by customers (e.g., Made in Italy for fashion products). Because of the latter, the proposed approach may represent a viable pathway for the reshoring of companies from abroad.

AB Cloud federation is a novel concept that has been drawing attention from research and industry. However, there is a lack of solid proposal that can be widely adopted in practice to guarantee adequate governance of federations, especially in the Public Sector contexts due to legal requirements.
   In this paper, we propose an innovative governance approach that ensures distributed and democratic control in cloud federations. Starting from FaaS, a recent cloud federation proposal, we propose a blockchain infrastructure for the federation registry that implements the proposed governance approach.

AB Blockchain is here to stay. Some affirm that it is the next big thing after the Internet. Blockchain is a network-based technology that rewards participants to assemble transactions which will next configure blocks and later be part of a chain. Blockchain guarantees immutability and integrity of data without the need of a third suryeilling party. It is therefore a revolution in current systems of trust. It also brings automation and self-execution of processes thanks to its embedded smart contracts functionality. Current standards drafting and development processes can definitively benefit from blockchain technology, and perhaps see the standardization domain revolutionize, like it already happened in the fintech and insurtech arenas [1]. In this paper, we explain what these advantages are. And, before new standard drafting models emerge from the disruptive blockchain community, challenging traditional standard development models -with this paper-, we want to inspire and give tools to established standardization bodies for them to take the lead and initiate a transformation towards 'Blockchained Standards' so that they can keep their authority and leadership in the field going forward.

AB We present atomic trade protocols for Bitcoin and Ethereum that can bind two parties to swap coins in the event that two blockchains emerge from a single "pre-fork" blockchain. This work is motivated by a bet between two members of the Bitcoin community, Loaded and Roger Ver, to trade 60,000 bitcoins in the event that Bitcoin Unlimited's planned hardfork occurs and the blockchain splits into two distinct forks. Additionally we study several ways to provide replay protection in the event of hardfork alongside a novel mechanism called migration inputs. We provide a detailed survey and history of previous softforks and hardforks in Ethereum and Bitcoin.

AB Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency in the market at this time. A crypto currency is a kind of currency which has no physical form, but rather only works over the internet. This also means that there are a lot of vulnerabilities in this form of money transaction. The purpose of this paper is to explore some of these issues as well as suggest ways in which we can keep bitcoin secure.

AB in the year 2009, a new virtual currency called Bitcoin was introduced to the world. Bitcoin generation and transactions are based on hashes and asymmetric encryption algorithms. Bitcoin is the first attempt at creating a decentralized virtual currency with no central bank or financial entity controlling it and is very attractive to different demographies of users. A lot of misunderstanding and doubt surrounds Bitcoin. Based on studying the few years of Bitcoin's circulation and usage, we presented the strengths and weaknesses of Bitcoin and analyzed what opportunities and threats it faces in the current financial environment. We summarized the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for Bitcoin in an SWOT analysis. We concluded that the most important factors to influence the future of Bitcoin circulation and price are technological advances and people's openness to Bitcoin, the intervention of governments and financial powers by creating laws around cryptocurrencies and external events that are closely tied to the Bitcoin community.

AB Blockchain technology is being considered as one of the ultimate revolutions that will be able to disrupt several pillars of our society. It is a public and distributed ledger built for security and interoperability. Blockchain provides all parties a secure and synchronized record of immutable transactions assembled together and permanently stored with a fingerprint, creating therefore an irreversible chain. In order to operate, this technology does not rely on any central authority. All transactions are sent over the network and the consensus is achieved by the mutual calculation and agreement. In this paper, we evaluate the blockchain technology and its evolution. Then, we characterize some essential features of the distributed ledger technologies (DLT) focusing on the three main blockchains actors: Bitcoin, Ethereum and Hyperledger. Besides, we present their security challenges and explore their drawbacks that can lead to use the blockchain network in order to conduct several attack scenarios. Finally, we describe their relationship with the onion router network (Tor) that beyond the malicious uses of the blockchain via Tor, these two networks share many common points.

AB Numerous applications require users to interact with a multitude of entities in order to avail a service. In such applications, the identity of the user is typically verified through physical or digital tokens, which are prone to both identity theft (lost or stolen tokens) and repudiation claims by malicious users. The use of biometrics can provide non-repudiability by ensuring that a purchaser is the bonafide user of the service. However, in applications entailing multiple stakeholders, there may be privacy issues with sharing user's biometrics data. While this concern can be addressed by storing the user's biometric data on the token itself, strong mechanisms are required to ensure that token is both secure and tamper-proof. In this paper, we propose a single use biometric token that relies on Shamir's secret sharing algorithm and blockchain technology to ensure that the encrypted biometric template contained in the token is secure, tamper-proof, and any attempt to use the issued token is irrefutably logged to prove subsequently that the user indeed availed the service. We also analyze issues related to the system security, user privacy, and usability of the proposed solution.

AB Blockchain is a technology that is based on Bitcoin cryptocurrency. It is a technology for decentralizing transaction and managing data. Immense research and deep thinking has gone into conceptualizing blockchain since the time it was first showcased by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The growing interest among researchers and technologists is the central attribute of blockchain that provides a high level of security, anonymity and data integrity without any intervention from third party who is in control of the transactions. Here in this study we have carried out through a well-defined study with the sole aim of collecting all relevant research areas and technologies on Blockchain Technology. With Blockchain becoming future in transactions in financial sector, it also comes with its own burden of risks. But since it has the potential to revolutionize the existing technology, it feels right to take the plunge[1].

AB Mobile Financial Services (MFS) represent an area of innovation and strategic importance for global initiatives against poverty, and telcos; the World Bank wants financial inclusion of the poor and telcos seek profit. Merely mobile payment services are not sufficient for any of these objectives, and there is a joint interest in enabling mobile credit and saving services. It is widely recognized that successful adoption of mobile saving and credit services is dependent on a digital solution; it requires a transition from current cash based over-the-counter (OTC) solutions to future digital accounts (mobile wallets/mWallets). Firstly, this paper reviews previous research on MFS, secondly it summarizes the global industry picture for MFS today, and thirdly, we provide key learnings from the successful Easypaisa case in Pakistan. MFS can also be characterized as implementations in complex ecosystems with lots of tension and dependent on local circumstances. The unique Easypasia case we present is a further proof of the complex processes and events that moves a MFS implementation from one state to another. It also shows how Easypaisa's significant jump from cash-based to digital mWallet solutions was triggered by a governmental regulation on ID requirements for mobile subscriptions. The ecosystem approach and significance of local conditions is vital to be aware of when the industry turns to new aspects of MFS and when technologies such as blockchain may disrupt the current situation.

AB Smart contracts have recently attracted interest from diverse fields including law and finance. Ethereum in particular has grown rapidly to accommodate an entire ecosystem of contracts which run using its own crypto-currency.
   Smart contract developers can opt to verify their contracts so that any user can inspect and audit the code before executing the contract. However, the huge numbers of deployed smart contracts and the lack of supporting tools for the analysis of smart contracts makes it very challenging to get insights into this eco-environment, where code gets executed through transactions performing value transfer of a crypto-currency. We address this problem and report on the use of unsupervised clustering techniques and a seed set of verified contracts, in this work we propose a framework to group together similar contracts within the Ethereum network using only the contracts publicly available compiled code. We report qualitative and quantitative results on a dataset and provide the dataset and project code to the research community.

AB We are experiencing an ever-larger gap and an ever growing solid disconnect between existing knowledge in the public policy of international trade or factors of global and national economic growth and the discourse of contemporaneous presidential and parliamentary election debates, in the US, Europe, and elsewhere alike. At the same time we are experiencing an ever-decreasing attention given in national and state political races and further political discourse to issues of major concern to ever larger and larger groups of engaged citizenry. Similarly, the continued effects of the 2008 economic crisis combine with the current hot beds in international security and the refugee crisis as factors contributing to the amplifying of extremist xenophobic political discourses across the Western world.
   In spite of the worrying trends identified above we propose what might seem as a complete opposite: the application to politico-socio-economic evolution of humankind of an analytical tool with the potential to offer an optimistic perspective for humankind's future. It is flows and the trends over time that characterize flows.
   Stemming from advanced thermodynamics, the constructal theory of design and evolution in nature proposes that 'for a finite-size flow system to persist in time (to live) it must evolve such that it provides greater and greater access to the currents that flow through it.' In papers [1] and [2] authors Bejan and Marden, and Bejan and Lorente, verify the constructal law at the design of both inanimate systems with flow (rivers basins, turbulent flow structure, self-lubrication) and animate systems with flow (lung design, cardiovascular system design, animal locomotion).
   Similarly, Bejan also proposes the general application of the constructal law to humankind made systems ([3-5]). Social systems, political systems, economic systems (the financial and monetary system, the system of trade and exchanges of raw materials, industrial products and services), the system of intangible capital flows globally (knowledge, human capital, market capital, and process capital) might all be governed by the constructal law of design and evolution in nature. We propose an interdisciplinary research agenda encompassing a multitude of disciplines that need to focus their efforts in the direction of verifying how well constructal law applies to socio-economic systems, and how its analytical and predictive power can inform global public policy making. As a case study, we trace several trends in global political economy, and particularly in the evolution of the monetary system from transactional money-less exchanges through the middle ages, Bretton Woods, US Exit from the gold standard (or the Nixon shock), Bretton Woods II, and currently in the post-2008 rise of the "alternative virtual currencies era," trends that justify why we believe in the application of the contructal law to socioeconomic systems. We explore the reasons for the rise of the latest trends with bitcoin, blockchain, and peer-and micro-lending and direct mobile phone based payment systems, and how all these fit inside a constructal law explanation. We then dare some future epistemic development predictions in the future practice and law of bitcoin and blochchain, by comparing them as a case study with recent developments in other connected and more mature areas of the law of e-commerce.

AB Financial price bubbles have previously been linked with the epidemic-like spread of an investment idea; such bubbles are commonly seen in cryptocurrency prices. This paper aims to predict such bubbles for a number of cryptocurrencies using a hidden Markov model previously utilised to detect influenza epidemic outbreaks, based in this case on the behaviour of novel online social media indicators. To validate the methodology further, a trading strategy is built and tested on historical data. The resulting trading strategy outperforms a buy and hold strategy. The work demonstrates both the broader utility of epidemic-detecting hidden Markov models in the identification of bubble-like behaviour in time series, and that social media can provide valuable predictive information pertaining to cryptocurrency price movements.

AB The limited size of a block in the Bitcoin blockchain produces a scaling bottleneck. The transaction scalability problem can be addressed by performing smaller transactions off-chain and periodically reporting the results to the Bitcoin blockchain. One such solution is the Lightning Network.
   Bitcoin is employed by lawful users and criminals. This requires crimes against lawful users as well as the use of Bitcoin for nefarious purposes to be investigated. However, unlike Bitcoin, the Lightning Network enables collusion attacks involving intermediate nodes and recipients. In such an attack, regardless of a sender's actions, money is received by an intermediate node that colludes with a dishonest recipient. Since the dishonest recipient does not "actually" receive the money, it does not provide the goods/service to the sender. Thus, the sender pays for the unprovided goods/service, but the recipient can prove that the payment was not received.
   This chapter discusses the forensic implications of collusion attacks with regard to lawful users because no discernible traces of attacks remain, as well as for law enforcement, where the attacks can target parties as a form of forfeiture, analogous to law enforcement "sting" operations. This chapter also discusses the potential of the Lightning Network to be used for money laundering activities.

AB Bitcoin is a system created to service micro-payments in e-commerce, as well as the digital unit of value functioning in the system's environment. When analysed, the behaviour of market participants indicates that the introduction of investment applications of the cryptocurrency, in parallel with its original payment application, had a tremendous impact on the larger-scale functioning of the system. This was aided by the functioning of many trading platforms allowing for exchange into traditional currencies and a high volatility of quotations.
   Without doubt, bitcoin may be branded a ground-breaking financial innovation or a work of genius. However, the growing, and even global use of bitcoin has brought some of the system's imperfections to light. As the system developed, bitcoin users started to have a better view of the threats to the correct functioning of the system arising from its construction.
   The paper aims to indicate the main barriers limiting the functioning of the bitcoin system, and its use in payments in particular. The work has adopted the following research hypothesis: In the early stages of bitcoin functioning, users had little awareness of the technological flaws of the system. The study analyses the literature on the subject and the results of a survey carried out among Polish bitcoin users. The analysis confirms of the research hypothesis, as it shows that in the system's first several years, users identified the following threats to the system's functioning: the speculative nature of bitcoin, the lack of adequate awareness in society which would allow for a widespread use of the innovation, potential too strict regulation of the cryptocurrencies market or its banning. The authors also present threats to the functioning of the system which in their opinion are of greatest importance at the moment. These relate to the existence of intermediaries, the lack of systemic incentives addressed to bitcoin merchants, growing costs and payment processing time. The authors intend to indicate those aspects of bitcoin's functioning in order to make the use of cryptocurrencies more conscious and contribute to limiting financial risk of system users.

AB This paper describes the design and development of a decentralized firewall system powered by a novel malware detection engine. The firewall is built using blockchain technology. The detection engine aims to classify Portable Executable (PE) files as malicious or benign. File classification is carried out using a deep belief neural network (DBN) as the detection engine. Our approach is to model the files as grayscale images and use the DBN to classify those images into the aforementioned two classes. An extensive data set of 10,000 files is used to train the DBN. Validation is carried out using 4,000 files previously unexposed to the network. The final result of whether to allow or block a file is obtained by arriving at a proof of work based consensus in the blockchain network.

AB Cognitive cellular networks can enable opportunistic network access but their effectiveness relies on adaptive handoff algorithms. However, in cognitive radio networks the usufructuary rights of a secondary user are rescinded due to the unanticipated appearance of a primary user causing potential service disruption. In order to provide uninterrupted service to a cognitive cellular user, we propose elastic handoff as a composite framework of conventional cellular and voluntary spectrum handoffs. As with spectrum handoff, elastic handoff grants secondary users spectrum access while insulating them against the arrival of primary users. On the other hand, it is similar to cellular handoff in providing secondary users service assurance. The setup also offers users multiple network access choices, and affords carriers the means to generate additional revenue by capitalizing on excess capacity. We use a blockchain-based spectrum exchange and smart contracts to implement elastic handoff. Our tests show that user-initiated elastic handoff may reduce call drops by up to half compared to observations from a conventional cellular market, and network-initiated elastic handoff can improve a carrier's revenue maximization prospects.

AB Cloud-centric cognitive cellular networks utilize dynamic spectrum access and opportunistic network access technologies as a means to mitigate spectrum crunch and network demand. However, furnishing a carrier with personally identifiable information for user setup increases the risk of profiling in cognitive cellular networks, wherein users seek secondary access at various times with multiple carriers. Moreover, network access provisioning - assertion, authentication, authorization, and accounting - implemented in conventional cellular networks is inadequate in the cognitive space, as it is neither spontaneous nor scalable. In this paper, we propose a privacy-enhancing user identity management system using blockchain technology which places due importance on both anonymity and attribution, and supports end-to-end management from user assertion to usage billing. The setup enables network access using pseudonymous identities, hindering the reconstruction of a subscriber's identity. Our test results indicate that this approach diminishes access provisioning duration by up to 4x, decreases network signaling traffic by almost 40%, and enables near real-time user billing that may lead to approximately 3x reduction in payments settlement time.

AB Wearable health devices, mobile apps and diagnostic tools revolutionize the medical field by introducing new assisting devices for patients in a way to create comfort, communication and augmented intelligence. Internet of Things involved in this transformation to provide an environment where a patient's vital parameters get transmitted by sensor devices via a gateway onto secure cloud-based platforms where it is stored, aggregated and analyzed. It also helps to store data for millions of patients and performs analysis in real time, ultimately promoting an evidencebased medicine system. Privacy and security are concerns in this environment. Based on the latest trends, this paper introduces a new healthcare paradigm named as SMEAD by developing an end-to-end secured system for assisting diabetic patients. It includes wearables to monitor different parameters thus observe and predict the diabetes status of the patient. The proposed system employs a MEDIBOX which is used to configure the dosage required and provides an alert to the users reminding them to take medication on time. In this case, the insulin dosage is maintained at suitable cooling conditions and is continuously monitored using the mentioned system. To keep all the data secure and to enable access to this data by the doctor and other trusted parties, a Blockchain-based disruptive technology is implemented which facilitates cryptographic security and formalized data access through smart contracts for medical communities. In case of an emergency like missing a dosage, abnormal blood sugar levels or any security lapse, an alert is sent to the caretakers via social networks like Twitter, Facebook or WhatsApp using mobile as a gateway which can continuously communicate the data over the internet that could save patients from fatal effects of the disease.

AB Blockchain technology realizes unforgeable and decentralized ledger by applying P2P network, cryptography and consensus mechanism over distributed network. Its security relies on all of these technologies. One of fundamental problem of the security of blockchain technology is compromise of underlying cryptographic algorithms. This paper shows the impact of compromise of underlying cryptography and the way to extend the validity of blockchain applying the long-term signature scheme which was standardized in ETSI. The longterm signature scheme assume the existence of centralized PKI and secure time-stamp service. In this paper, we propose a method to apply similar concept and data structure with de-centralized manner. Our scheme avoids hard-fork of original blockchain, in the case of compromise of hash function and provides smooth-fork in the case of compromise of digital signature scheme.

AB The Bitcoin "phenomenon" has spread its wings especially over the past two years, experiencing an unprecedented growth and being supported by several companies from the international scene. The result is the possibility of buying goods and services using the Bitcoin currency. But the most important thing is the state support which, at the present time, either does not exist, or is in the moment of granting, requiring time. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency created and given to users (located in front of a computer connected to the Internet) who solve a special category of mathematical problems. Computers around the world "extract" Bitcoin, competing with each other. This extraction can become quite competitive among users because new Bitcoins are created at a predictable and fixed rate. The more users join the network, the more difficult it becomes to make a profit for each of them. Bitcoin is mainly used in the Hidden Internet - that portion of the Internet that is not accessible to the general public through a regular browser - in purchasing illegal goods and services.

AB In this article, a secure and verifiable electronic voting scheme is proposed. Encrypted votes are accumulated and prepared in the form of block on each electronic polling booth at the end of polling time. The resultant block from each electronic polling booth is distributed to the authorized nodes of group for temper proof block chaining that assures the internal verifiability. The external verifiability is attained through the redistribution of temper proof Blockchain ledger to the validated and authorized nodes of auditing group. The temper proof property of electoral data is achieved using an emerging Blockchain Technology. Whereas the secure data distribution in the form of temper proof blocks and ledger amongst the authenticated group members is accomplished through the cryptographically secure group oriented scenario. The individual and universal verifiability features in our proposed scheme make the electoral process transparent, reliable and verifiable.

AB Ever increasing adoption of cloud technology scales up the activities like creation, exchange, and alteration of cloud data objects, which create challenges to track malicious activities and security violations. Addressing this issue requires implementation of data provenance framework so that each data object in the federated cloud environment can be tracked and recorded but cannot be modified. The blockchain technology gives a promising decentralized platform to build tamper-proof systems. Its incorruptible distributed ledger/blockchain complements the need of maintaining cloud data provenance. In this paper, we present a cloud based data provenance framework using block chain which traces data record operations and generates provenance data. We anchor provenance data records into block chain transactions, which provide validation on provenance data and preserve user privacy at the same time. Once the provenance data is uploaded to the global block chain network, it is extremely challenging to tamper the provenance data. Besides, the provenance data uses hashed user identifiers prior to uploading so the blockchain nodes cannot link the operations to a particular user. The framework ensures that the privacy is preserved. We implemented the architecture on ownCloud, uploaded records to blockchain network, stored records in a provenance database and developed a prototype in form of a web service.

AB Rapid advancement in wearable technology has unlocked a tremendous potential of its applications in the medical domain. Among the challenges in making the technology more useful for medical purposes is the lack of confidence in the data thus generated and communicated. Incentives have led to attacks on such systems. We propose a novel lightweight scheme to securely log the data from bodyworn sensing devices by utilizing neighboring devices as witnesses who store the fingerprints of data in Bloom filters to be later used for forensics. Medical data from each sensor is stored at various locations of the system in chronological epoch-level blocks chained together, similar to the blockchain. Besides secure logging, the scheme offers to secure other contextual information such as localization and timestamping. We prove the effectiveness of the scheme through experimental results. We define performance parameters of our scheme and quantify their cost benefit trade-offs through simulation.

AB Health management and wellbeing are critical topics for senior citizens as the associated healthcare related costs tend to rise. There are various efforts to promote active ageing as a way to balance physical, social and mental wellbeing for the elders. Among the aspects that are considered in a preventive healthcare strategy, physical activity is one of the most important components, as it was evidenced that physical inactivity is the main risk factor for many serious health conditions. This paper introduces an application scenario for senior citizens that engage in a physical activity program which is recommended by a medical expert. The other stakeholders involved are a private insurance company and medical service provider. The agreements between these parties and the corresponding economic compensations are specified in a smart contract that is executed in a private blockchain. The design of the user interface follows the PACT (people, activities, contexts, technologies) framework, and for the evaluation of its impact it was proposed the model for assessment of telemedicine (MAST) methodology.

AB Enhancing the mathematics classroom using computerised drills for homework is shown to provide considerable benefits for student learning in diverse regions, from high-tech westerns classrooms to those with neither Internet nor stable electricity. This paper describes results from several experiments using the tutor-web educational system for teaching mathematics with student groups ranging from upper primary school through graduate school. When existing teaching methods are augmented using this technology, quantitative and qualitative results across all regions and age groups indicate improvements in learner performance. Although it has a wide range of functions, the tutor-web system is most importantly a drilling system, which would normally be classified as an Adaptive and Intelligent Web-based Educational System (AIWBES) providing quite personalised learning, tailoring a drill sequence for each student. In addition to personalised grading schemes aimed for enticing the student to continue, a different reward scheme is implemented by giving the students a cryptocurrency whenever they complete a topic with excellence. Initial results of the effects of these various reward schemes are also presented.

TI Protecting National Economy: Modern Issues of Currency Regulation
SO PRAVO-ZHURNAL VYSSHEI SHKOLY EKONOMIKI
AB At the international level, uncertainty still remains over the issues of currency and legal responsibility, which is largely due to various legal regulations. Beginning with 2018, the European Union will bring into force new rules for calculating the liquidity of banks and the ratio of borrowed funds and assets that change its monetary policy. Not everyone is happy with the new rules. Several large French banks even have appealed to the European Court of Justice for a change in the rules. According to statements by financial analysts, the European Central Bank is on the verge of abandoning the ultrasoft monetary policy in the direction of neutral and is further preparing for tightening it. In most cases, companies that carry out foreign economic activity violate currency legislation. At the same time, civil measures may not be sufficient to protect the normal functioning and development of the domestic foreign exchange market. For this reason, the laws of the Russian Federation provide for liability for non-repatriation of funds. However, not all countries today establish this kind of responsibility. Meanwhile, due to the revival of the idea of private money in the form of cryptocurrencies and other modern monetary surrogates the question of how to protect the national economy in modern conditions requires separate analysis. Therefore, the urgency of searching for common approaches to currency regulation is growing. The subject of the paper is a monetary system and monetary relations from the point of view of analyzing contemporary problems of ensuring its stability, including criminal legal means. The purpose of such an analysis is to show clearly which mechanisms of protection of the domestic foreign exchange market are being applied at present and with what problems the monetary system is facing today. The article is prepared on the basis of the technical analysis of legal norms, the comparative legal method, the method of system analysis, the formal logical method. According to the authors, such an analysis would contribute to a uniform approach to the problem, without which it will be extremely difficult to achieve success. It is concluded that in view of new challenges in the world economy and the emergence of the crypto currency, it is now necessary to rethink the phenomenon of currency crimes, to study the experience of combating monetary crimes in other countries and to assess the overall mechanisms.

Yet, beyond the original bitcoin protocol, the safety and reliability properties of such systems are not sufficiently analyzed. To better understand the behavior of these systems, we propose VIBES: a configurable blockchain simulator for large scale peer-to-peer networks. With VIBES, users can explore important characteristics and metrics of the network, reason about interactions between nodes, and compare different scenarios in an intuitive way. VIBES differentiates itself from previous works in its ability to simulate blockchain systems beyond bitcoin and its support for large-scale simulations with thousands of nodes.

AB Why is the educational industry so slow in adopting crowd content opportunities? This contrasts with transaction streams observed in other industries such as advertising, music, encyclopedias and travel. To answer this question, and informed by a literature review, we develop a model of transaction streams in the MOOCs industry and prove that MOOCs pricing, optimal design and best-price search are NP-complete problems. The proof suggests computational complexity is what prevents aggregation services and provides additional insights into what should be pricing policies that foster transaction streams in digital learning. In particular, it suggests three business models to develop the full value creation potential of transaction streams in education: first, one open to aggregation at no cost (very open or open source software model); second a model centrally controlled by one academic institution (flat fee or Spotify model); finally, we propose a class of simplified pricing models (and introduce on of them, MOOCIX) to enable a third route (legal programming or blockchain model) that would enable business models with financial sustainability for the MOOC industry by creating a blockchain-based "Internet of Value" around the learning industry. We contend existing models such as Open Courseware and CCX are timid approaches that do not fall in any of the three categories above and, thus cannot explode because of computational complexity constraints. To overcome these hurdles we recommend Open Courseware, for example, could change its licensing to allow for-profit revenue from improvements (i.e. a-la-GNU-GPLx), and CCX could evolve into a Spotify-type "flat" model. We conclude reviewing briefly possible avenues of future research.

AB Cold chain logistics finance, as a new financial means, has been integrated into the development of "agriculture, farmer and rural area" and has injected new impetus into it. From the current form of financial operation of cold chain logistics, the cold chain logistics finance, influenced by many factors, such as many subjects, asymmetric information, etc., is faced with the risks of market, guarantee and operation and all kinds of risks can ultimately be attributed to the credit risk of enterprises and participating entities. It was explored to the block chain technology to prevent financial risks from the perspective of information technology on the basis of various risks. It was first analyzed to the evolution of cold chain logistics financial credit, analyzed the characteristics of block chain technology, and then cold chain logistics financial credit system framework was proposed based on the block chain technology, finally a solution was given to the credit problem based on the framework in this paper.

AB The SSL protocol has been widely used for verifying digital identities and to secure Internet traffic since the early days of the web. Although X.509 certificates have been in existence for more than two decades, individual user uptake has been low due to the high cost of issuance and maintenance of such certs. This has led to a situation whereby users are able to verify the identity of an organization or e-commerce retailer via their digital certificate, but organizations have to rely on weak username and password combinations to verify the identity of customers registered with their service. We propose the X509Cloud framework which enables organizations to issue certificates to their users at zero cost, and allows them to securely store and disseminate client certificates using the Bitcoin inspired blockchain protocol. This in turn will enable organizations and individuals to authenticate and to securely communicate with other users on the Internet.

AB The generation of information is growing at a surprising pace. The emotional ascent of unstructured information like photographs, recordings and online networking has introduced another type of non-social databases and which are named as "Big Data". In 2012, the measure of data put away overall surpassed 2.8 Zetabytes. By 2020, the aggregate sum of information put away is required to be 50 times bigger than today. Big Data must be prepared and analysed to deliver potential ideas and extreme information must be comprehended from this sea of information. A famous system Hadoop is utilized as of now to process such huge information. Here we execute LIBRA with various approaches that altogether lessen the information skew-(a typical issue in mapreduce) by element part methodology without pre-processing the whole data. To give question preparing, another algorithm Block-Chain is introduced.

AB Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency nowadays. Inspired by the success, both industry and academia seek to apply Bitcoin's core technique, Blockchain, to other fields like finance, healthcare and Internet-of-Things. One main application is to use Blockchain as the distributed transaction ledger system, a ledger (or a log) of all transactions that is maintained by anonymous participants in a distributed fashion. For the ledger system, consistency is an important property which specifies how the system orders the transactions. Intuitively, Blockchain is designed to maintain a single ground truth - the chain itself is the order of the transactions that all participants should respect. However, we show that under some circumstances, Bitcoin violates eventual consistency, i.e., participants would not converge to a single chain. Thus, we urge a more thorough study on Bitcoin's consistency properties. At the end of the paper, we propose related research directions.

AB In the last decade, we have seen the emergence of the Bitcoin crypto-currency, where the Blockchain technology builds trust transaction after transaction through a validation process. Academics focused their research on security flaws or improvement, but we identify a lack of literature on how the validation of transaction and block proceeds. In fact, understanding the validation will help the conception of new blockchain features and allow users to recognize all security risks. This paper aims at a deep comprehension and detailed analysis of the validation in the Bitcoin protocol.

AB Up2U its a recent European project that focuses on a specific learning context and very formative period represented by secondary schools that in most European countries provide education to secondary students.
   The aim is to develop an innovative 'solution based on a ecosystem that facilitates more open, effective and efficient co-design, co-creation and use of digital content, tools and services specially adapted for personalized, collaborative or experimental learning for students preparing for university.
   The project entails the provision of educational applications, project-based and peer-to-peer learning scenarios and the facilitation of international interaction for secondary schools in Europe.
   We believe on creative teachers that will be placed on the process to encouraged others to provide and innovative experience to others and expect their inputs and ideas for implementation.
   We are inspired by organic educational initiatives, such as Google for Education, Khan Academy and the like, Up2U creates a flipped virtual ecosystem where students can learn at their own pace supported by social interactions, federated access and are able to exchange documents and other project-related multimedia content in a trusted and privacy-protected environment.
   The initial phase of Up2U will focus on the adoption and customization of a learning management system that will implement basic functionalities and standard Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) interfaces.
   During the first year the new platform is expected to create an environment for creative student projects across Europe whose results will be shared with other schools and made publicly available. Personalized learning analytic's, peer reviews and community-driven digital recognition systems - using Open Badges and block chain technology - will also be investigated.
   Some educational experiences will be performed with some groups of teachers from some schools on the pilot countries. Teachers will be encouraged to change the process and promote distributed learning initiatives as, for example, lecture recordings, and learning activities mediated by technology.

AB Today it is common that people are users of more than one social networking site, so more and more people have multiple accounts on the web. It is challenging to identify the anonymous users on the web. A technique based on the friend relationship is used to identify the same user on multiple social networking sites. It is based on the concept that friend relationships cannot be faked by others. Based on that FRUI (Friend Relationship User Identification) algorithm is developed to match users on multiple sites. It calculates the matching degree for all users with similar screen names on multiple sites and users with the highest matching degree will be considered as the identical users. The proposed method is extended to find the fraud identities in social media sites including the bitcoin concept.

AB The Blockchain technology has witnessed boost in adaptability with respect to its application especially in distributed public ledgers dealing in the financial and academic sectors. However, the major drawbacks of this technology cause hindrance for sustaining in a longer run. Which is why applications solely built on Blockchain might also witness a decrease in their adaptability. Tangle, on the other hand, provides a more suitable and reliable system which also address the drawbacks of Blockchain.
   In this paper, we propose a framework to authenticate academic degrees and certificates build on Tangle so that the intermediate and middle parties which verify the transaction or data are eliminated, having a decentralized control with complete visibility to all the actors involved in the system. Additionally, Tangle provides a quantum resistant architecture that too without any significant charge.

AB Domain name system is an essential component of the Internet, but is facing numerous security threats. On the other hand, blockchain has been widely used since Bitcoin. Theoretically, most of the decentralized system can be rebuilt using blockchain. Namecoin and Blockstack have made attempts to combine domain name service with blockchain, but have defects in security and performance. In this paper, we propose a new domain name service based on a consortium chain network which contains query nodes and miner nodes. To address the storage challenge of blockchain, the system is designed with three-layer architecture and additional external storage. In addition, the system builds index for transactions and blocks to speed up domain name resolution and incorporates gossip protocol to synchronize blocks between different nodes.

AB The knowledge economy requires new flexible approaches to standardization and certification. The labor market needs to define clear criteria for the competence of graduates as potential employees and participants in the business community. The requirements of employers for the skills and competencies of job candidates are reflected in vacancy announcements. The analysis demonstrates significant differences between the description of the functional roles at the workplace, given by the business, and the content of both professional and educational standards, approved by the State. The professionalizing of education requires the development of a flexible system of formulating the competences that are necessary for innovative growth of the economy, which would reflect the business' needs in the human resource and would allow the most accurate provision of opportunities for individuals' self-realization in the talent management system on corporate, regional or global level. Masterchain platform is developed in Russia as a model of distributed data, as a reliable and flexible system to record events (e.g., a register of property rights or the diploma' issuance) seems to be a convenient regulatory mechanism to harmonize the expectations of enterprises and personal interests of individuals. The paper examines the possibilities to put into operation the Masterchain platform and to form on its basis a business intelligence system to analyze and harmonize the competencies required by employers and reflected in their vacancy announcements with the individuals' personal talents and interests presented in the portfolio.

AB Blockchain technology underpins a radical rethink of information privacy, confidentiality, security and integrity. As a decentralised ledger of transactions across a peer-to-peer network, the need for a central third party intermediate verification authority is disrupted. To unlock the potential for mHealth, the need for authentication and verified access to often sensitive data, specialised services and transfer of value need to be realised. This paper interrogates current processes and aims to make a case for Blockchain technology as an improved security model that has the potential to lower the cost of trust and an alternative to managing the burden of proof. This is particularly relevant for mHealth that, by its nature, is often a distributed endeavour involving the goal-orientated collaboration of a number of stakeholders.

TI Modelling the contracts of the future
SO GRIFFITH LAW REVIEW
AB This article examines contract as a focal point of modern society both in terms of the way that it is used to classify relationships and the way in which it is used to order relationships. I look at how contractual structures and relationships across a variety of speciman scenarios (private sector supply contracts and public service delivery contracts) can be explained using the work of Ian Macneil. He gives us an account of how the socialising contexts of contract relationships evolve and change. Smart contracts offer a new way of constructing relationships. Their advocates suggest that they have the potential to revolutionise the practice of exchange. I consider smart contracts from Macneil's perspective and work through whether his account of relationality will be able to encompass this new practise.

AB Micro-credentialing combined with Blockchain, MOOCs and free online course provide sufficient motivation for Higher Education to critically evaluate its long term role in educating the next generation. A changing student population and the continual technological developments puts pressure on universities to blend, flip and video classes. Many organisations feel the need to follow suit as education lurches from the age old tradition of the "Sage on the stage" to the "Guide on the side". This shift impacts teaching spaces, expectations regarding student approaches to learning, and requires the development of a new didactic approach. Teachers who are used to 'sending' knowledge during traditional lectures to halls filled with students, find themselves appearing in front of green screens, segmenting their classes into short video chunks, and developing more interactive learning sessions. Are these the right choices to follow, based on what empirical evidence and how can we ensure that this process is positive for all involved? A tourism 'model' was segmented into 40 short (58 minute) web lectures (studio recorded videos with power point slides) on a university course. Over six semesters, the content was reverse engineered into the course structure, and 'constructively aligned' with assessment goals. Each course iteration enabled the embedded content to be actively implemented more deeply, through interactive workshops, peer teaching, student generated video clips and student formulated exam questions. Teaching through the video lens resulted in the development of a new didactic approach for the lecturer. Both the on-screen 'Video Teaching' persona, and the new interactive role in class were enabled as a result of the catalyzing possibilities of video and the 'digitization' of the teacher. Student perceptions of this learning approach reveal positive support for this format. The ongoing research into this subject is supporting the transition of lecturers into this new didactic both in The Netherlands and internationally.

AB Modern supply chain is a complex system and plays an important role for different sectors under the globalization economic integration background. Supply chain management system is proposed to handle the increasing complexity and improve the efficiency of flows of goods. It is also useful to prevent potential frauds and guarantee trade compliance. Currently, most companies maintain their own IT system for supply chain management. However, this approach has some limitations that prevent one to get most of the supply chain information. Using emerging decentralized ledger technology to build supply chain management system is a promising direction. However, decentralized ledger usually suffers from low performance and lack of capability to protect information stored on the ledger. To overcome these challenges, we propose CoC, a novel supply chain management system based on hybrid decentralized ledger. We develop an efficient block construction method with the model and security mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to data stored on the ledger.

AB With the promotion of electric power reform in China, distributed energy participating in power market transaction becomes possible. However, due to the characteristics of transaction decentralization, multiple energy synergies, information symmetry and the large quantity, the transaction cost and the risk of information leak increase significantly, which inhibits the enthusiasm of distributed energy to participate in electric power transaction. The block chain has been widely used in finance, logistics and other industries because of its decentralized data processing. In this paper, the characteristics and infrastructure of the block chain is analyzed and the distributed energy trading frame work based on the block chain is built. The result shows that block chain has significant effect on the information security of the energy transaction.

AB Blockchain is an emerging technology that can be utilized to break ground for secure provenance through the use of a centralized-based application. The method of distributed ledger can serve as the trust machine mechanism to prevent the malicious attacks. This paper introduces a novel service to complement some open-source blockchain protocols. A vital point of adopting blockchain technology is to encourage more and more parties to join for higher security and better efficiency. National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) has initiated a service, named NBCP, for rapidly constructing multiple blockchain nodes around Taiwan. With several pros, users can easily construct private blockchain nodes, catering to the need of developing various prototypes of blockchain-based applications.

TI Research on a New Signature Scheme on Blockchain
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB With the rise of Bitcoin, blockchain which is the core technology of Bitcoin has received increasing attention. Privacy preserving and performance on blockchain are two research points in academia and business, but there are still some unresolved issues in both respects. An aggregate signature scheme is a digital signature that supports making signatures on many different messages generated by many different users. Using aggregate signature, the size of the signature could be shortened by compressing multiple signatures into a single signature. In this paper, a new signature scheme for transactions on blockchain based on the aggregate signature was proposed. It was worth noting that elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and bilinear maps played major roles in our signature scheme. And the security properties of our signature scheme were proved. In our signature scheme, the amount will be hidden especially in the transactions which contain multiple inputs and outputs. Additionally, the size of the signature on transaction is constant regardless of the number of inputs and outputs that the transaction contains, which can improve the performance of signature. Finally, we gave an application scenario for our signature scheme which aims to achieve the transactions of big data on blockchain.

AB Palm vein biometric authentication has become a research trend in these past few years. This is due to the robustness and distinctiveness properties of the palm vein that make it suitable to represents human unique identity. This paper presents an alternative authentication method by using master and child key generation from palm vein. A suitable method of extracting the region of interest (ROI) from the palm vein is also proposed in order to gain high authentication accuracy. In this research, palm vein is extracted by using Competitive Hand valley detection (CHVD) method. The master and child key is generated based on improved method adapted from the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32(BIP32) - Ed25519 scheme. The proposed method is aimed to increase the security of the authentication system by applying one time used key concept where the child key will only be used once for authentication and then it will be deleted. A new key that has been generated from the master key will be used for the next authentication. Therefore, it is hard for attacker to attack and guess the key used for the authentication.

AB Blockchain technology has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Applications of blockchain are not only restricted to cybercurrencies, but have also been extended to other areas such as finance, e-health, music, and other business. One of the key components of blockchain is the design for miners who are responsible for adding new transactions (blocks) by solving a puzzle and receive some rewards in return. As a result, miners tend to join centralized mining pools to outsource their computing resources in order to gain more steady rewards, which may affect the security and fairness of the system. This motivates the researchers to propose nonoutsourceable puzzles. However, existing nonoutsourceable puzzles do not work well under the high-rate transaction processing protocol (GHOST). In this paper, we propose the first nonoutsourceable puzzle that can satisfy all security requirements of GHOST. Our experimental results show that our puzzle is practical.

AB Blockchain is a new type of decentralized technology, causing more and more attention because of the huge number of implicit revolutionary applications in many fields, especially in the finance field. The DAO was a crowdfunding project based on blockchain. It was one of the most widely-known blockchain applications in 2016, not only because of the most amount of crowdfunded money (i.e., ETH tokens) so far, in a very short period, but also due to the attack event. In this paper, a brief introduction of The DAO attack event is presented. We also present an acute analysis of the result that "the hacker stole large quantity of money from The DAO", as well as the analysis of the suggested solution that "the wallet address of the hacker should be frozen" to the event given by The DAO community. Accordingly, two logical paradoxes are formulated on the event results and the proposed solution. Finally, The DAO paradoxes are formally described, analyzed, and proved in propositional logic.

AB Online wallet has become an important method to manage Bitcoin. In a Bitcoin transaction, online wallet manages the private key automatically, and stores the encrypted private key in remote to ensure the accessibility of Bitcoin anywhere. In the traditional online wallet, the private key is stored centrally in a storage unit. However, if the storage unit is collapsed or hacked, users will suffer the risk of losing their Bitcoins. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new online wallet architecture: HA-eWallet. In HA-eWallet, the transaction of Bitcoin is signed by multiple private keys rather than one, and private keys are stored separately in different places. In addition, we introduce a second service unit to construct the Active-Active architecture to rotate the capability and workload. Besides, we adopt a disaster recovery strategy in our proposed architecture in case of any disaster. According to the running states of each service unit, HA-eWallet have three operation models, and can be switched smoothly. Theoretical analyses and experiments show that: HA-eWallet can achieve higher availability compared with the traditional online wallet architecture, and users will not suffer a loss as long as the number of lost private keys are less than 50% of the users' total number of private keys.

TI WHITHER POLICING CRYPTOCURRENCY IN MALAYSIA?
SO IIUM LAW JOURNAL
AB Cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, is a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank. It is an emerging financial technology enabled by innovation, increasingly popular among global Internet users, and more interestingly, it challenges the existing financial and regulatory rules on the currency and payment systems of the world today. On the other side, certain cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, have been actively used as payment tools for illicit transactions. Both the "promising" and "challenging" faces of cryptocurrency trigger causes for concern for policy makers, not only from financial sector, but also legal and technological sectors. The decentralised nature of cryptocurrency creates unique problems for the government to regulate or impose any regulatory requirements. This article argues that, in order for Malaysia to remain at the forefront of financial and digital innovation, it is timely to look at the question on whether to formulate certain policy and regulatory framework on the use of cryptocurrency in Malaysian market. The answer can pave the way for Malaysian digital citizens to potentially grab the opportunities made possible by the cryptocurrency technology. For this purpose, the researchers seek to study the features of cryptocurrency and the experiences from policymakers in other jurisdictions in dealing with the matter.

AB Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008, blockchain systems have evolved immensely in terms of performance and usability. There is a massive focus on building enterprise blockchain solutions, with providers such as IBM and Microsoft already providing Blockchainas-a Service (BaaS). To facilitate the adoption of blockchain technologies across various business verticals, we argue that middleware plays an integral role in accelerating the development of automated business processes (i.e., smart contracts). We argue that decentralized messaging is a key requirement of many distributed applications and should be provided as a reusable blockchain middle-ware. Our system, called HyperPubSub, provides decentralized publish/subscribe messaging for a multi-federated, permissioned, environment. HyperPubSub provides secure and privacy-preserving messaging, which is audited using blockchains for validation and monetization purposes. We demonstrate our implementation using Kafka and Hyperledger.

TI The Art of Crypto Currencies A Comprehensive Analysis of Popular Crypto
   Currencies
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Crypto Currencies have recently gained enormous popularity amongst the general public. With each passing day, more and more companies are radically accepting crypto currencies in their payment systems, paving way for an economic revolution. Currently more than 700 crypto-currencies are available at Coindesk alone for trade purposes. As of November 2016, the Crypto currencies hold a total market share of over 14 Billion USD1 [5]. With no centralized institution to monitor the movement of funds, Crypto currencies and their users are susceptible to multiple threats. In this paper we present an effort to explain the functionality of some of the most popular crypto currencies available in the online market. We present an analysis of the mining methodologies employed by these currencies to induce new currency into the market and how they compete with each other to provide fast, decentralized transactions to the users. We also share, some of the most dangerous attacks that can be placed on these crypto currencies and how the overall model of the crypto currencies mitigates these attacks. Towards the end, we will present taxonomy of the five highly popular crypto currencies and compare their features.

TI Technological Change of the Innovation Payment System
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT
AB This paper explores the process of technological change in the payment system. In particular, the study aims to gain understanding if Bitcoin would bring about a paradigmatic shift toward a cashless society. The analysis is based on the technology S-curve and Schumpeter's model of economic development. It is interesting to see that the swing of S-curves is not strong enough to cause a paradigm shift according to the Schumpeterian concept of creative destruction. The study also compares Bitcoin with PayPal, a similar digital currency and major online payment system, to gain insights of the new challenge toward a cashless economy. The parallel S-curve trajectories of electronic money innovations signify a move from a cash-based economy toward a less cash society.

TI Evaluating the effectiveness of the SMART contract-signing strategy in
   reducing the growth of Swedish Adolescents' substance use and problem
   behaviors
SO BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Background: In 2013, around 40 % of the schools in Sweden had structured programs to prevent tobacco and alcohol debut in compulsory school. There has unfortunately been a lack of scientific evidence to support most of the prevention methods focusing on primary prevention in schools in Sweden. The aim and purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Non-Governmental Organization SMART contract-signing strategy in reducing the growth of youth substance use and other problem behaviors amongst Swedish adolescents.
   Methods: Students from five schools in a medium-sized Swedish municipality were surveyed in three waves from 7th to 9th grade of compulsory school. We used General Linear Model (GLM) repeated-measures ANOVA to test if the outcome measures smoking, use of snus and alcohol, drunkenness, delinquency, and bullying significantly changed different amounts over time in groups that had participated in the SMART program for long time, a short time, sporadically-or not at all. Groups were compared on demographic background variables, and outcome measures were assessed on all measurement occasions by a one-way ANOVA. The magnitude of group differences at the end of the study was estimated according to Cohen's d.
   Results: Number of years with a contract has an effect on the levels of self-reported youth problems in 9th grade. We found small to medium-sized differences in measured outcomes between students who participated in the program for the longest period of time, 5 years, and who participated for the shortest time, 0-2 years.
   Conclusion: Findings suggests that the SMART program has preventive effects on adolescent substance use.

TI Not all payments are created equal: segmenting the payment landscape
SO JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL MARKET INFRASTRUCTURES
AB The payments landscape is changing. Checks and cash are declining and being replaced by electronic instruments; a range of new players are taking aim at the role and position of banks; and new technologies such as Bitcoin/Distributed Ledger are even challenging the nature of money itself. An often-heard argument is "a payment is a payment", implying that a new player with a superior technology or customer proposition, if successful, would be able to ultimately replace all existing payment instruments/systems. This paper argues that the current payments landscape consists of segments with inherently different characteristics that require different approaches. Most dynamics occur within such segments, rather than across them.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOBILE COMPUTING AND MULTIMEDIA COMMUNICATIONS
AB Are there theoretical foundations that may substantiate communication in an online environment in regard to accounting reporting and implementation of information via mobile accounting technologies that brings together communication, numbers and computing? This conceptual paper explores the creation of an imagined community that has all the characteristics to connect accountants together with the implementation of mobile devices based on Anderson's theory of imagined communities. It describes a wide range of trends in relation to current and emerging technologies used and maps processes of financial reporting into this milieu via the notion of imagined communities. It argues that a sense of coherence exists between its members who feel a sense of belonging to the same group, even if they have never met. The paper examines for the first time in this conceptual multidisciplinary study whether the characteristics of the imagined communities that construct identity are related to accounting community formation and this is the theoretical contribution of the paper.

   personality models
SO PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
AB This study was designed with the aim to compare the predictive power of the five-factor and the alternative five-factor personality models in relation to dimensional pathological personality in a sample of 650 adult subjects from the general population. ZKPQ-50-CC dimensions predicted 32% (ranging from 10% to 51%) and NEO-FFI-R 40% (ranging from 31% to 58%) of the total variance of the DAPP-90 factors. Local regression (LOESS) graphical analysis showed that the ZKPQ-50-CC Neuroticism-Anxiety and Aggressiveness were the best predictors for Dissocial Behavior. Neuroticism-Anxiety and low Socialization predicted Social Avoidance, Activity predicted Compulsiveness and Neuroticism-Anxiety and Aggressiveness predicted Emotional Dysregulation. While the NEO-FFI-R Extraversion, low Agreeableness and Conscientiousness predicted Dissocial Behavior. Neuroticism and low Extraversion predicted Social Avoidance, Conscientiousness predicted Compulsiveness and Neuroticism, low scores of Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness predicted Emotional Dysregulation. The predictive power of both personality models with respect to the abnormal personality dimensions was similar, but the NEO-FFI-R was the best predictor of Compulsiveness (31% vs 10%). Results suggest the existence of a structural continuum between normal and non-normal personality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent years have witnessed the advances of e-money systems such as Bitcoin, PayPal and various forms of stored-value cards. This paper adopts a mechanism design approach to identify some essential features of different payment systems that implement and improve the constrained optimal resource allocation in Germany. Bitcoin is a digital, decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by German or any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other commodity. Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Compared to most currencies or online payment services, such as PayPal, bitcoins are highly liquid, have low transaction costs, and can be used to make micropayments in Germany. Although the Bitcoin economy is flourishing, Bitcoin users are anxious about Bitcoin's legal status. This paper examines a few relevant legal issues. The research question is to investigate how supplementary digital terminating currency Bitcoin can provide a superior fallback position as e-gold standard in Germany and worldwide. Digital self-liquidating e-Gold ounce could be distributed immediately to voters by using swipe cards used by some governments for transit facilities. Bitcoins as e-Gold ounce do not provide a viable medium of exchange because of the cost of their purchase, creation and/or exchange.

AB In this work we propose a scheme that could be used as an alternative to the existing proof of work(PoW) scheme for mining in Bitcoin P2P network. Our scheme ensures that the miner must do at least a non-trivial amount of computation for solving the computational problem put forth in the paper and thus solving a PoW puzzle. Here, we have proposed to use the problem of finding the largest clique in a big graph as a replacement for the existing Bitcoin PoW scheme. In this paper, we have dealt with a graph having O(2(30)) vertices and O(2(48)) edges which is constructed deterministically using the set of transactions executed within a certain time slot. We have discussed some algorithms that can be used by any Bitcoin miner to solve the PoW puzzle. Then we discuss an algorithm that could perform this task by doing O(2(80)) hash calculations. We have also proposed an improvement to this algorithm by which the PoW puzzle can be solved by calculating O(2(70.5)) hashes and using O(2(48)) space. This scheme is better than the existing proof of work schemes that use Hashcash, where a lucky miner could manage to find a solution to the proof of work puzzle by doing smaller amount of computation though it happens with very low probability. Bitcoin incentivizes the computing power of miners and hence, it is desirable that miners with more computing power always wins. Also, the Bitcoin PoW scheme only incentivizes computing power of miners but our PoW scheme incentivizes both computing power and memory of a miner. In our proposed scheme only the miner cannot randomly find a largest clique without knowing the clique number of the graph.

AB Reviews and journals are currently revolving the topic of cryptocurrencies, even if, so far, the domain of law has not found the spur to adequately and univocally frame this phenomenon. Nonetheless, the US legal theory is presently debating how to include Bitcoins into pre-existing "regulatory folders", while the country's judiciary is dealing with the first cases pertaining to Bitcoins. The reaction of the US legal system to this radical technological innovation demonstrates that the operational rules resulting from the joint action of the legal formants may grant a legal system a first response by relying merely on its own legal tools. In light of this, the present article investigates the reactions to Bitcoin and the potentially suitable regulatory frameworks proposed by US legal theory.

AB 2008 is the year of creation of the Bitcoin network consisting of a decentralized database, which is storing all transactions of bitcoin tokens, whose quantity is predetermined by a protocol and independent of any authority. The aim of this article is to describe the limits in the use of Bitcoin as medium of exchange. Bitcoin network operation is carried out at high costs of electrical energy consumption, which, will over time be reflected in the price of transactions. Low transaction prices, which is one of the main arguments of Bitcoin promoters, are only possible with continuous issuance of new bitcoins to circulation. Bitcoin's - "prove of work" - is the most energetically demanding method from all currently existing methods securing cryptoplatforms. Halving mechanism which reduces the rewards of miners create pressure to decrease hash rate, which is a reflection of the rate of network security. The pressure to decrease hash rate is for now overrun by the increasing efficiency of mining devices. The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost? Will halving mechanism ultimately cause a declined hash rate, and thereby also a reduction in network security?

AB Herein it is proposed a simple algorithm for automatic hopping among mining pools in the Bitcoin network. The hopping ceases to occur when the best pool to be mined is found. The choice of the best pool is based on statistical data generated and collected during the operation of the Bitcoin network. Experiments for validation and performance analysis are based on mining networks built specifically for this purpose. The major results show for instance that the bitcoin generation increases at 46.0% comparing to when the mining is carried out in only one isolated pool. Additionally, it is evaluated the possibility of implementing a distributed application making use of the proposed algorithm. Lastly, general conclusions and possible avenues for future works are highlighted at the end of this article.

AB Mankind has inherited the earth. But, up to now there is little hint on the meaning and the purpose of this inheritance. Science, thus far, has explained only a tiny fraction. The real issue is identified as the problem of surviving the permanently uncertain future. Technically, the problem can be called the Requirement of Permanence. All the knowledge discoveries of the past, the present, and the future and all the wisdom of the universe accumulated from the infinite past seem to be aimed at satisfying this Requirement of Permanence. And, by the best account, merely looking at the living system on earth, the problem seems to have been solved, as far as the universe in concerned. However, science, dealing with certainty, has missed the essence of the problem, which is solving the permanently uncertain future. The solution is expanded and further explained by Post-Science Social Science based on the solution of value, Post-Science Life or Computer Science based on the solution of complete automation, and Post-Creational Fuzzy Logic for describing the fuzzy reality resulting from the sacrifice of precision in the expansion of the range of tolerance of error of a creation for surviving all the possibilities of the uncertain future. The same solution for solving the problem of the uncertain future is used for solving the problems of financial crises and complexity crises, which will plague our society in the Age of Abundance. Post-science promotes the concept of a future cooperative society of abundance guided by knowledge. A knowledge-oriented, not power or money-oriented, society is needed to solve the problem of surviving the uncertain future permanently. Only knowledge will give mankind the right to inherit the earth and to connect to the wisdom of the universe.

AB Bitcoin has a number of features and properties which are sometimes presented as interesting and positive. In fact they are closer to engineering mistakes. Serious problems are programmed in the DNA (the source code) of great majority of crypto currencies. Small details in the source code can make very big difference. In this chapter seven major 'sins' of Bitcoin are discussed highlighting risks and suggesting solutions.

AB Botnets have been becoming increasingly resilient, rampant, larger and powerful in recent years. Going beyond traditionally malicious intents of stealing credentials, sending spam and DDoS, botnet herders have now even begun to monetize CPU cycles of zombie machines under their control, by illegal cryptocurrency mining. Following recent advances in efficient password cracking by the use of Markov chains, Context Free Grammar, and other methods for smart generation of candidate passwords for trial and error, the time taken for breaking hashed passwords has greatly decreased when compared to traditional brute forcing. This paper aims to describe the practicality of a botnet specifically designed to break passwords. Various modes of botnet based password breaking and the advantage in terms of highly accelerated hash rates obtained are discussed. Comparisons with hash rates of cloud-based cracking are also discussed. A load distribution model is shown in which workload is homogenously and uniformly distributed across nodes of varying computing power. This model is designed to be independent of the password guessing algorithm or combination of algorithms used. Also, the resilience of passwords against large search spaced brute force attacks by botnets are studied, and its results extrapolated to smart methods of password guessing.

AB In 2013, a monetarily moderate but widely noted bitcoin theft drew attention to a flaw in Android's pseudo random number generator (PRNG). A programming error affecting the information flow in the seeding code of the generator has weakened the security of the cryptographic protocol behind bitcoin transactions.
   We demonstrate that logic-based verification can be efficiently applied to safeguard against this particular class of vulnerabilities, which are very difficult to detect otherwise. As a technological vehicle, we use the KeY verification system for Java. We show how to specify PRNG seeding with information flow contracts from the KeY's extension to the Java Modeling Language (JML) and report our experiences in verifying the actual implementation.

AB The personal cloud, a virtual compute instance controlled by an individual, is becoming inevitable. We believe that the current interoperability and communications evolution will drive the adoption of personal clouds. In order to provide personal cloud interoperability, we propose an end to end authentication mechanism based on JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and the blockchain. JWTs are a standardized container format to encode personal cloud and client related information in a secure way using "claims". The distributed, undeletable, immutable, and irreversible nature of the blockchain has appropriate attributes for distributed credential storage and decentralized identity management.

   Upheaval in Payments
SO BITCOIN AND MOBILE PAYMENTS: CONSTRUCTING A EUROPEAN UNION FRAMEWORK

AB Mobile payments and bitcoins represent a leap forward in payments. Acknowledging that they are different, yet recognizing a common "digital" denominator, this concluding chapter outlines their salient features in the broad context of the historical evolution of payment mechanisms operated in the framework of a classical model. Thereunder, a payment order issued to a paymaster initiates the transmission of monetary value from a payer-debtor to a payee-creditor. The chapter points out that the mobile payment introduces complexities and variations reflecting its digital nature. At the same time, fundamentally, its operation is premised on that of the classical model. Conversely, not only that Bitcoin introduced new money-equivalent, it is further premised on a decentralized network within which monetary value moves without the involvement of a paymaster.

AB The blockchain technology has emerged as a disruptive technology in recent years. The open and transparent nature of the distributed ledger, as supported by the blockchain technology, is an appealing factor to push this technology in applications with strong accountability and audit requirements such as cryptocurrency systems (i.e. Bitcoin) and ecommerce (i.e OpenBazaar). In order to guarantee the integrity of the distributed ledger, a set of miner nodes is in place that uses computing power to prove the authenticity of the ledger, in exchange for a small compensation fee. In this paper, alternative reward schemes for the miners are presented.

AB The article covers the analysis of Bitcoin usage opportunities in international settlements. Although the frequencies of Bitcoin usage for daily payments have significantly increased, imperfections of the legal framework still create the barriers to treat this cryptocurrency as an alternative to fiat currencies that are employed for settlements all over the world. Considering its legal framework, Germany can be treated as the country, most advanced in the area of Bitcoin usage regulation: business people, who operate in the territory of the country, or those who serve German consumers without registration of their businesses in Germany are obliged to obtain the licence (authorisation) from German Federal Financial Supervisory Agency (GFFSA). Provision of financial services without GFFSA licence is considered as law violation with imposed fines or imprisonment. The results of the research propose that, due to the small number of the locations, where settlements in Bitcoins are available, treatment of Bitcoin as a criminal currency (Russia, China) as well as poor measures of consumer protection, Bitcoin can be treated only as an alternative to traditional measures of settlement, but not as a substitute to them.

In this paper we propose a way to implement trust by the usage of the technology that stays behind the cryptocurrencies. After an analysis of the existing blockchains, an example is built on top of Openchain in order to demonstrate our approach.

AB The future of the banking and financial world is tightly connected with ICT technologies, it works and relies on them. Currently there are more digital moneys circulating the world than traditional paper money. Most of the banking transactions today are done through the means of e-banking and m-banking. It is fair to assume that in the near future we will witness a global redefinition of the banking system, payment network, currencies and financial transactions as we know them today. New paradigms are emerging, ICT companies primarily based in the Silicon Valley with their inventions are threatening the traditional banking world. New digital currencies, e-banks and way of doing online transactions is a reality in the developed countries. We are experiencing the rise of the new digital currency which are governed by decentralized banking systems and are not under control of any government. In the new future, traditional banking will be something of our past. In this paper we have analysed the usage of various payment methods in North America (Canada and USA) and South East Europe (Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro). We present an analysis of the usage of PayPal and Bitcoin in these regions.

AB The use of digital applications is on the rise nowadays. So the processing of those data is done by a tool calledMapReduce. MapReduce has its own structure which cannot be modified. While processing those data, skew will occur in both map and reduce the phase. Map skew is easy to reduce but in case of reduced phase it may take time to reduce it. So a methodology is being created to reduce the Reducer side skew and time being compared between the new method and MapReduce to find their efficiency.

   This tutorial aims to further close the gap between IT security research and the area of cryptographic currencies and block chains. We will describe and refer to Bitcoin as an example throughout the tutorial, as it is the most prominent representative of such a system. It also is a good reference to discuss the underlying block chain mechanics which are the foundation of various altcoins and other derived systems. In this tutorial, the topic of cryptographic currencies is solely addressed from a technical IT security point-of-view. Therefore we do not cover any legal, sociological, financial or economical aspects.
   The tutorial is designed for participants with a solid IT security background but will not assume any prior knowledge on cryptographic currencies. Thus, we will quickly advance our discussion into core aspects of this field.
   This tutorial is a modified version of the tutorial held at WWW2016 [9]. It incorporates received feedback and customized content.

It is estimated that the United States from tax revenue between $ 40 and $ 70 billion per year, due to undeclared income held in tax haven bank accounts. DGH (Internal Revenue Services) 2007 has foreseen the development of open-stream payment systems based on in-game economy, such as Bitcoin, which is not confined to a virtual volume and that functions in the real economy. Using offshore bank accounts, tax evaders may prefer to use Bitcoin for tax evasion, which is essentially taxpayers who are aware of their liability to declare their income and pay taxes.

Modern life as we know it would be unthinkable without cash and electronic money. Under the influence of globalization and the development of Internet trading technology gets more and more importance, a phenomenon cryptocurrencieslike Bitcoin lead to revolutionary changes in the financial world, presenting a sort of challenge to banks and all other interested parties. Searching for alternatives in light of the financial business becomes commonplace, a Bitcoin as a platform represents a good basis for the development and construction of new innovation where each user contributes to the creation of its value through a decentralized system of global networks. Its worth is determined by supply and demand in the market and the willingness of others to accept it as legal tender. Bitcoin technology includes features based on protocols, encryption and digital signature, which requires a certain level of IT knowledge and equipment to use. Despite the kind of risks in doing business with Bitcoin, Bitcoin every day becomes stronger, more robust and globally is gaining more supporters. Due to the increasing popularity of virtual currency aim of the paper is to investigate and analyze the Bitcoin system, based on primary research through a questionnaire to determine what kind of information to patients about Bitcoin, options trading and mining it and how Bitcoin trading at all represented in the Republic of Croatia. Given the speed of developments in technology, it is very likely that the market will play money in the future and continue to grow, and advocates of the concept of Bitcoin will face the potential ups and downs of this for now still unpredictable option to transfer money.

AB Over the past eighteen months, the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin has experienced significant growth in terms of usage and adoption. It has also been predicted that if this growth continues then it will become an increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities. Against this background, it seems safe to assume that students and professionals of digital forensics will require an understanding of the subject. New technologies are often a major challenge to the field of digital forensics due to the technical and legal challenges they introduce. This paper provides a set of tutorials for Bitcoin that allows for learners from both backgrounds to be taught how it operates, and how it may impact on their working practice. Earlier this year they were delivered to a cohort of third year undergraduates. To the author's knowledge, this represents the first integration of the topic into a digital forensics programme by a higher education provider.

AB We present the design of a novel data structure. We aim to solve the issue of window/range-based queries of distributed data stores in peer to peer architectures. Traditional models, for example, distributed hash tables (DHTs), are hostile towards window queries because their hashing operations are designed to uniformly distribute stored data across a defined key space; the hashing operations used to achieve this even key distribution inherently erase all characteristics of the target data that could be used to classify it. We solve this problem of erasure by defining a scheme in which higher-order data is mapped to a first-dimensional key space, while preserving locality. The resulting key space is not uniformly distributed, so we define a distributed consensus protocol in which participants in our network agree to target highly populated regions of the key space, through deterministic redistribution. This consensus scheme also provides protection from Sybil attacks, as it is a series of stratified hash-based proof-of-work systems. A peer to peer communication system acts as the underlying network for participants, providing all of the traditional benefits of a P2P architecture, while allowing our solution to operate reliably in the presence of adversaries.

Based on assumptions about the form of marginal tail integrals and a Clayton Levy copula, the model allows for capturing intraday cross-dependency. The model is applied to VaR of the portfolios constructed on stock returns as well as on cryptocurrencies. The proposed method shows fair performance compared to classical time series models.

AB In this paper we propose a mechanism entitled Delay-Aware Packet Prioritisation (DAPP) that works at WiFi packet queue level. DAPP enqueues packets according to their time spent in the network, such that more delayed packets are enqueued towards the head of the queue. We study the effects of such an approach in wireless multi-hop scenarios where VoIP packets with various delay impairments reach a congested node. Packets' delay builds up as congestion increases and we show that DAPP improves a network's VoIP capacity by distributing the negative effects of delay to those VoIP packets that so far travelled in good network conditions. This is to the advantage of those VoIP packets already negatively affected by network conditions, as they are allowed to pass a congested node with less further delay accumulation. We use extensive NS-3 simulations where a wide range of network impairments affect VoIP calls, and we demonstrate that DAPP is able to improve the VoIP capacity and fairness among VoIP calls in a wireless multi-hop network.

This article aims to elucidate both the conceptual part of the Bitcoin addressing the historical, economic and legal aspects as well as the possible social benefits that the currency can bring as a first alternative, based on technology, to the traditional money controlled by the State. The method used for this purpose is the deductive one and the technique is the bibliographical research, starting from the examples of the use of money throughout history and the rise of Bitcoin as currency.

SE New Economic Windows
AB Bitcoin and other privately created digital currencies are beginning to challenge central banks' monopolies on money creation. These decentralized cryptographic payment media could ultimately displace legacy banking, finance, and Payment services at a lower cost across the globe. These currencies are likely to continue experiencing a faster rate of improvement than traditional payment media and require less force for safekeeping. This chapter explores some of the forces that led to the rise of Bitcoin including the ball-in tax on deposits during the Cyprus banking crisis in 2013. We also examine the relative stability of Bitcoin as a store value. We also consider new internet-based P2P lending arrangements using Bitcoin rather than dollars as a payment media. Finally, we reassess Stanley Fischer's criticism of Hayek's competitive private currency proposal in light of Bitcoin and other open source digital currencies.

AB The area of Digital Currencies has achieved an enormous increase since the emerge of Bitcoin in 2009. Bitcoin is considered to be the most successful cryptographic digital currency in history. It is the best example which introduces the idea of Digital Currencies not just as a theoretical concept, but, in addition, it promotes Digital Currency in a practice. Bitcoin is said to be an example which does not work in theory but works in practice [1]. This detail has attracted science community to further research Bitcoin system, and, therefore, Bitcoin is found to be subject of research for many scientists nowadays. In this paper we conduct a brief analysis in the Bitcoin overall system. Furthermore, we focus more on the anonymity that Bitcoin system offers to the user in terms of user traceability. At this part we present current approaches from related work papers towards user de-anonymization in Bitcoin, and we try to give suggestions how one can lower the performance of these approaches. Finally, we throw a spotlight in money mixing tools which increases anonymity in the Bitcoin system.

AB As present, the block chain as a new technology, has aroused a lot of attention. Its technical characteristics, decentralization and distributed consensus, make it have a wide range of application prospects in the financial sector. Risks of traditional P2P which were hidden behind the lending transactions have been gradually exposed to the real. However, the application of its distributed ledgers and smart contracts on the new P2P platform, could realize transparency, efficiency and accuracy of transaction, as well as the union and share of credit. At the same time, this kind of blend can also reduce the cost of transaction on P2P platform. Although the blend between block chain and P2P still has regulatory problems, there is no doubt that the new changes will bring P2P a broad development prospect.

AB Phenomenon of virtual currencies started mainly in 2008 when Bitcoin (the main and the most important representative of virtual currency) was introduced but gained particular attention in 2013, when its value significantly increased. Bitcoin is probably the most successful and probably the most controversial virtual currency system to date. This sort of currency has no central issuing authority, and uses a public ledger to verify transactions while preserving users' anonymity. It operates on a global level and can be used as a currency for all kinds of transactions (for both virtual as well as for real goods and services), which competes with the official currencies other than the euro or the US dollar. This paper analyzes whether virtual currency such as Bitcoin can be used, now or in the future, as an alternative to real currency and its impact on financial markets. It also focuses on its positive and negative effects and tries to predict future development as a medium of exchange. The rules for virtual currencies are still shaping, which may result in significant fluctuations and significant losses of investors. Regulation of this market, however, will not be as easy as in the case of real currency because the basis of virtual currency is the internet and technological innovation. We can say that bitcoin, and other virtual currencies, currently lie somewhere on the boundaries between currency, commodity and financial asset. The best definition would be that it is currently a speculative financial asset that can be used as a medium of exchange.

Since traditional agri-food logistics pattern can not match the demands of the market anymore, building an agri-food supply chain traceability system is becoming more and more urgent. In this paper, we study the utilization and development situation of RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology first, and then we analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using RFID and blockchain technology in building the agri-food supply chain traceability system; finally, we demonstrate the building process of this system. It can realize the traceability with trusted information in the entire agri-food supply chain, which would effectively guarantee the food safety, by gathering, transferring and sharing the authentic data of agri-food in production, processing, warehousing, distribution and selling links.

AB There have been many speculations on how a post-human world would look like: the speculations regarded the fact that we would need eternal life, on the one hand, and on the other hand that artificial intelligence would exceed human intelligence, etc. What we do not know yet - but we can speculate on it regards the role of the economy in the post-human society. Does the economy exist in such a society? We believe it does, and we also believe that the economy will not lose its status along with the transition from a society to another. Considering that in the post-human era the individual will live in a virtual space, having a virtual family and virtual friends, behind this space there will be the so-called (human or nonhuman) workers who will take care of the maintenance of these virtual spaces, ensuring the eternal life.
   We are witnessing an emulation regarding the possible types of economy, something like a hyper-technique, which is capable to interact with the economic and social mechanisms.
   At the same time, these new features are continuously supported by humans; in fact, a new kind of human. The block chain is considered a form of information technology, provided by intelligent agents.
   In order to make a connection with the, Brave new world" of A. Huxley[3], we believe that a modern version of soft slavery is also possible; within it, the post-human individuals will overpower the inferior individuals by means of genetic engineering techniques and not only.
   The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of the economy within a post-human society. Within our approach we will present aspects related to genetic engineering, trans-humanism, human enhancement and immortality in order to outline the fact that we cannot give up the economy even though we achieve eternal life.

Particularly, we categorize the results into two groups: new problem formulations and practical applications. In the first part, we discuss new ways to define the consensus problem, which include larger input domains, enriched correctness properties, different network models, etc. In the second part, we focus on real-world systems that use Paxos or Raft to reach consensus, and Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) systems. We also discuss Bitcoin, which can be related to solving Byzantine consensus in anonymous systems, and compare Bitcoin with BFT systems and Byzantine consensus algorithms.

This paper mainly studies the fluctuations of bitcoin price and discusses weather digital currencies represented by bitcoin have the potential to invest. Cointegration analysis and VEC (Vector Error Correction) Model have been performed to demonstrate the relationship between bitcoin price and some variables including stock price index, oil price and daily trading volume of bitcoin. The empirical research indicates that there is long-term equilibrium and short-term dynamic relationship among the four factors. The short run analysis reveals that oil price and bitcoin trading volume have little influence on bitcoin price while stock price index has relatively larger impact on it. In the long run, stock price index and oil price have a negative effect on bitcoin price. On the contrary, the value of bitcoin is positively affected by daily trading volume.

AB Being a volunteer-run, distributed anonymity network, Tor is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Little is known about real-world Sybils in the Tor network, and we lack practical tools and methods to expose Sybil attacks. In this work, we develop sybilhunter, a system for detecting Sybil relays based on their appearance, such as configuration; and behavior, such as uptime sequences. We used sybilhunter's diverse analysis techniques to analyze nine years of archived Tor network data, providing us with new insights into the operation of real-world attackers. Our findings include diverse Sybils, ranging from botnets, to academic research, and relays that hijacked Bitcoin transactions. Our work shows that existing Sybil defenses do not apply to Tor, it delivers insights into real-world attacks, and provides practical tools to uncover and characterize Sybils, making the network safer for its users.

Attackers can target SDN controllers with simple attacks to cause denial of service. We proposed a defense mechanism based on a proof-of-work protocol. The key characteristics of this protocol, namely its one-way operation, its requirement for freshness in proofs of work, its adjustable difficulty, its ability to work with multiple network providers, and its use of existing TCP/IP header fields, ensure that this approach can be used in practice. We present a prototype implementation and performance results that show the effectiveness of this approach to protecting SDN controllers.

AB Credit rating refers to the debtor's ability and willingness to repay debt. The scheduled principal and interest are evaluated by any independent third-party credit rating agency with a set of simple rating symbols indicating the risk of default and the loss severity. The exact credit rating and the widely recognized credit rating indices are important for all investors, issuers, national regulatory authorities, and even the national economy. For example, the credit ratings of Standard &Poor, Moody's, and Fitch are significan tand sufficient to dominate the stock markets worldwide.
   The reliance of Standard & Poor, Moody's, and Fitch (the three leading credit rating agencies or" the Big Three") on the inherent advantages of the Wall Street financial markets and their sustained fair ratings for over a hundred years has built their credibility in the field. However, credibility does not guarantee absolute fairness of their credit ratings. During financial crises, any improper credit rating by the Big Three may greatly cause a negative effect on investors and the economy. The current model and process of credit rating require effective supervision and substantial improvement.
   In this article, a new credit rating process is proposed on the basis of the block chain technology. This new mode of operation is mainly applied through block chain encryption and some unalterable properties to abolish the credit intermediary functions of rating agencies. Using data encryption technology, the business data privacy being evaluated, the rating models, and the rating agencies' methods can be effectively protected. Furthermore, based on the mechanism of multiple copies of accounting books and public voting, these data may not be arbitrarily tampered. Thus, an open and transparent rating process is ensured, and the emergence of improper ratings due to the exchange of interests between the rating agencies and the units being rated or to be rated is avoided.

TI Fibronectin-binding protein TDE1579 affects cytotoxicity of Treponema
   denticola
SO ANAEROBE
AB While FbpA, a family of bacterial fibronectin (FN) binding proteins has been studied in several gram-positive bacteria, the gram-negative Treponema denticola, an anaerobic periodontal pathogen, also has an overlooked fly gene (tde1579). In this research, we confirm that recombinant Fbp protein (rFbp) of T. denticola binds human FN with a K-dapp of 1.5 x 10(-7) M and blocks the binding of T. denticola to FN in a concentration-dependent manner to a level of 42%. The fbp gene was expressed in T. denticola. To reveal the roles of fhp in T. denticola pathogenesis, an fbp isogenic mutant was constructed. The flip mutant had 51% reduced binding ability to human gingival fibroblasts (hGF). When hGF were challenged with T. denticola, the fbp mutant caused less cell morphology change, had 50% reduced cytotoxicity to hGF, and had less influence on the growth of hGF cells.

AB Cryptocurrency, a form of digital currency that has an open and decentralized system and uses cryptography to enhance security and control the creation of new units, is touted to be the next step from conventional monetary transactions. Many Cryptocurrencies exist today, with Bitcoin being the most prominent of them. Cryptocurrencies are generated by mining, as a fee for validating any transaction. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machine such as ASICs, running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256, thereby leading to faster generation of Cryptocurrencies.

TI Utilization of Acetaminophen as a Homogeneous Electrocatalyst for
   N-acetyl-L-cysteine Oxidation at the Surface of Carbon Paste Electrode
SO ANALYTICAL & BIOANALYTICAL ELECTROCHEMISTRY
AB The utilization of acetaminophen (AC) as a homogeneous electrocatalyst in the presence of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) at the surface of carbon paste electrode (CPE) modified with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) has been surveyed in aqueous medium using double step potential chronoamperometry (CHA), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) methods. Though, NAC itself shows a very negligible electrochemical response at bare CPE, the response could be greatly increased in the presence of acetaminophen at MWCNT paste electrode (MWCNT-CPE) which enables a sensitive electrochemical determination of the NAC. The kinetic parameters such as transfer coefficient (a), the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) and the chemical reaction rate constant (kh) were calculated 0.33, 5.56x10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) and 1.35x10(2) cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1), respectively. A linear calibration range of 1.0x10(-6) M-3.0x10(-5) M and detection limit of 3.9x10(-7) M were obtained for determination of NAC at MWCNT-CPE using DPV. The offered method is useful for the routine analysis of NAC in real sample.

TI Cryptocurrency Mining - Transition to Cloud
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB Cryptocurrency, a form of digital currency that has an open and decentralized system and uses cryptography to enhance security and control the creation of new units, is touted to be the next step from conventional monetary transactions. Many cryptocurrencies exist today, with Bitcoin being the most prominent of them. Cryptocurrencies are generated by mining, as a fee for validating any transaction. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized machines such as FPGAs and ASICs, running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and Scrypt, thereby leading to faster generation of cryptocurrencies. This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has been on since the day the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was introduced in 2009. However, with more people venturing into the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for this validation has become far more complex over the years, with miners having to invest huge sums of money on employing multiple high performance ASICs. Thus the value of the currency obtained for finding a hash did not justify the amount of money spent on setting up the machines, the cooling facilities to overcome the enormous amount of heat they produce and electricity required to run them. The next logical step in this is to utilize the power of cloud computing. Miners leasing super computers that generate hashes at astonishing rates that have a high probability of profits, with the same machine being leased to more than one person on a time bound basis is a win-win situation to both the miners, as well as the cloud service providers. This paper throws light on the nuances of cryptocurrency mining process, the traditional machines used for mining, their limitations, about how cloud based mining is the logical next step and the advantage that cloud platform offers over the traditional machines.

TI Bitcoin: juridical consequences from the development of the virtual coin
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE DIREITO
AB This article aims to understand the proper answers from Law to the creation of bitcoin. The paper explains, with introductory notions, and through the analysis of comparative legislation, the history of the coin, its economic consequences and paradigmatic changes. It also presents doctrinal considerations regarding the creation of the coin. The main goal of the paper is to analyze the possible hypothesis of regulation for the transactions with the cryptographic currency, which belong to a grey area, not yet regulated by law. The conclusion of this work is that the State must include the coin in its regulations, initially dealing only with tax evasion, with its possible connections to the illegal market and with the creation of a license to exchange coins. After that, it should regulate aspects that require great thoroughness, such as the protection of the rights of consumers.

AB In a consensus algorithm based on Proof-of-Work, miners are motivated by crypto rewards. Furthermore, security is guaranteed because a cost of a 50% attack chance is higher than the potential rewards. However, because of the sudden price jump of cryptocurrencies and cheap prices of mining machines like ASICs, the cost and profit were on equilibrium for Bitcoin in 2017. In this situation, attackers are motivated by the balance between hash power and profits. In this paper, we describe that there is relevance between mining power on the network and price of tokens that can be taken securely on a blockchain. Users who exchange tokens on the PoW blockchain should monitor mining power and exchange tokens cheaper than the attack cost so that profit and cost of the attacker are not in equilibrium.

AB We introduce a new framework for polling responses from a large population. Our framework allows gathering information without violating the responders' anonymity and at the same time enables public verification of the poll's result. In contrast to prior approaches to the problem, we do not require trusting the pollster for faithfully announcing the poll's results, nor do we rely on strong identity verification.
   We propose an "effort based" polling protocol whose results can be publicly verified by constructing a "responder certification graph" whose nodes are labeled by responders' replies to the poll, and whose edges cross-certify that adjacent nodes correspond to honest participants. Cross-certification is achieved using a newly introduced (privately verifiable) "Private Proof of Effort" (PPE). In effect, our protocol gives a general method for converting privately-verifiable proofs into a publicly-verifiable protocol. The soundness of the transformation relies on expansion properties of the certification graph.
   Our results are applicable to a variety of settings in which crowd-sourced information gathering is required. This includes crypto-currencies, political polling, elections, recommendation systems, viewer voting in TV shows, and prediction markets.

AB Location information in mobile devices are very important part of any location based transactions. The information can be faked and can be misrepresented for meeting specific requirements. A number of mechanisms have been used to ensure that the location information provided by the mobile device is accurate. In this paper, we introduce the notion of gathering evidences independently where each entity reports contacts with other entities in specific locations at specific times. Some of the reports may be not true and in order to scrutinize these, we introduce the global consistency check. This is mainly based on the model similar to the block chain model in Bitcoin. With a global consistency check we can ensure if a particular entity is being dishonest about the location information. We have used the EigenTrust and PeerTrust check methodologies to calculate global and personalised trust matrix while confirming attestation. The paper also shows the importance of global attestation scheme over local attestation.

The rise of forms of payment that are independent of governmental issued and controlled currencies, and which can be traded in a highly anonymous, instantly transferred and used for both legal and illegal transactions represent a new means of laundering money destined to finance the operations of terrorist organizations. Because virtual currencies have the capability of being used (legally) with lower fees than traditional funds transfer modalities, it is likely that their use will increase, and that legitimate organizations will make use of them. Understanding this new form of government-independent "money" is important to those involved in the field of terrorist interdiction.

AB Liquid chromatography is the method of choice for the purification of plasmid DNA (pDNA), since it is simple, robust, versatile, and highly reproducible. The most important features of a chromatographic procedure are the use of suitable stationary phases and ligands. As conventional purification protocols are being replaced by more sophisticated and selective procedures, the focus changes toward designing and selecting ligands of high affinity and specificity. In fact, the chemical composition of the chromatographic supports determines the interactions established with the target molecules, allowing their preferential retention over the undesirable ones. Here it is described the selective recognition and purification of supercoiled pDNA by affinity chromatography, using an intercalative molecule (3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridine) as ligand.

AB In a search task, a group of agents compete to be the first to find the solution. Each agent has different private information to incorporate into its search. This problem is inspired by settings such as scientific research, Bitcoin hash inversion, or hunting for some buried treasure. A social planner such as a funding agency, mining pool, or pirate captain might like to convince the agents to collaborate, share their information, and greatly reduce the cost of searching. However, this cooperation is in tension with the individuals' competitive desire to each be the first to win the search. The planner's proposal should incentivize truthful information sharing, reduce the total cost of searching, and satisfy fairness properties that preserve the spirit of the competition.
   We design contract-based mechanisms for information sharing without money. The planner solicits the agents' information and assigns search locations to the agents, who may then search only within their assignments. Truthful reporting of information to the mechanism maximizes an agent's chance to win the search. epsilon-voluntary participation is satisfied for large search spaces. In order to formalize the planner's goals of fairness and reduced search cost, we propose a simplified, simulated game as a benchmark and quantify fairness and search cost relative to this benchmark scenario. The game is also used to implement our mechanisms. Finally, we extend to the case where coalitions of agents may participate in the mechanism, forming larger coalitions recursively.

AB Various online, networked systems offer a lightweight process for obtaining identities (e.g., confirming a valid e-mail address), so that users can easily join them. Such convenience comes with a price, however: with minimum effort, an attacker can subvert the identity management scheme in place, obtain a multitude of fake accounts, and use them for malicious purposes. In this work, we approach the issue of fake accounts in large-scale, distributed systems, by proposing a framework for adaptive identity management. Instead of relying on users' personal information as a requirement for granting identities (unlike existing proposals), our key idea is to estimate a trust score for identity requests, and price them accordingly using a proof of work strategy. The research agenda that guided the development of this framework comprised three main items: (i) investigation of a candidate trust score function, based on an analysis of users' identity request patterns, (ii) combination of trust scores and proof of work strategies (e.g. cryptograhic puzzles) for adaptively pricing identity requests, and (iii) reshaping of traditional proof of work strategies, in order to make them more resource-efficient, without compromising their effectiveness (in stopping attackers).

AB Web security is a big concern in the current Internet; users may visit websites that automatically download malicious codes for leaking user's privacy information, or even mildly their web browser may help for someone's cryptomining.
   In this paper, we analyze abusive web resources (i.e. malicious resources and cryptomining) crawled from the Alexa Top 150,000 sites.
   We highlight the abusive web resources on Alexa ranking, TLD usage, website geolocation, and domain lifetime. Our results show that abusive resources are spread in the Alexa ranking, websites particularly generic Top Level Domain (TLD) and their recently registered domains. In addition, websites with malicious resources are mainly located in China while cryptomining is located in USA. We further evaluate possible counter-measures against abusive web resources. We observe that ad or privacy block lists are ineffective to block against malicious resources while coin-blocking lists are powerful enough to mitigate in-browser cryptomining. Our observations shed light on a little studied, yet important, aspect of abusive resources, and can help increase user awareness about the malicious resources and drive-by mining on web browsers.

AB Driven by the technology of mobile Internet of things and the wide demand of sharing economy, the development of smart locks is changing with each passing day. Current schemes rely on the open network architecture which has security vulnerabilities, privacy leaks, vulnerability to various attacks and other security risks. We propose an end-to-end succinct non-interactive offline authentication scheme based on blockchain technology(BC-SNOA). Using blockchain techniques such as anonymity, ellipticcurve cryptography, workload consensus, and privacy-preserving zero-knowledge proof, the BC-SNOA implements one-time pad to improve confidentiality, offline authentication to avoid network remote intrusions and the risk of network services interruptions. It is difficult to replicate and crack because of the in chip calculation of workloads and mathematical problems. Compared with current smart locks which extract biometric verification information and control by network services, the BC-SNOA scheme is likely to accomplish beneficial properties such as high verification performance and more secure, and also makes simple hardware implementations possible.

AB Cryptographic puzzles are moderately hard-neither easy nor hard to solve-computational problems. They have been identified to be useful in mitigating a type of resource exhaustion attacks on Internet protocols. Puzzles based on modular exponentiation are interesting as they possess some desirable properties such as deterministic solving time, sequential (non-parallelizable) solving process and linear granularity. We propose a cryptographic puzzle based on modular exponentiation. Our puzzle is as efficient as the state-of-art puzzle of its kind and also overcomes the major limitation of the previous schemes.

AB We present cryptocurrency-based lottery protocols that do not require any collateral from the players. Previous protocols for this task required a security deposit that is O(N-2) times larger than the bet amount, where N is the number of players.
   Our protocols are based on a tournament bracket construction, and require only O(log N) rounds. Our lottery protocols thus represent a significant improvement, both because they allow players with little money to participate, and because of the time value of money.
   The Ethereum-based implementation of our lottery is highly efficient. The Bitcoin implementation requires an O(2(N)) off-chain setup phase, which demonstrates that the expressive power of the scripting language can have important implications. We also describe a minimal modification to the Bitcoin protocol that would eliminate the exponential blowup.

TI Tracking digital footprints: anonymity within the bitcoin system
SO JOURNAL OF MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to critically analyse research surrounding the anonymity of online transactions using Bitcoin and report on the feasibility of law enforcement bodies tracing illicit transactions back to a user's real-life identity.
   Design/methodology/approach - The design of this paper follows on from the approach taken by Reid and Harrigan (2013) in determining whether identifying information may be collated with external sources of data to identify individual users. In addition to conducting a detailed literature review surrounding the anonymity of users, and the potential ability to track transactions through the blockchain, four Bitcoin exchange services are examined to ascertain whether information provided at the sign-up stage is sufficiently verified and reliable. By doing so, this research tests the ability for law enforcement to reasonably rely upon this information when attempting to prosecute individuals. Additionally, by submitting fake information for verification, the plausibility of these services accepting fraudulent or illegitimate information is also tested.
   Findings - It may be possible to identify and prosecute bad actors through the analysis of transaction histories by tracing them back to an interaction with a Bitcoin exchange. However, the compliance and implementation of anti-money laundering legislation and customer identification security standards are insufficiently used within some exchange services, resulting in more technologically adept, or well-funded, criminals being able to circumvent identification controls and continue to transact without revealing their identities. The introduction of and compliance with know-your customer and customer due diligence legislation is required before law enforcement bodies may be able to accurately rely on information provided to a Bitcoin exchange. This paper highlights the need for research to be undertaken to examine the ways in which criminals are circumventing identity controls and, consequently, financing their illicit activities.
   Originality/value - By ascertaining the types of information submitted by users when exchanging real currency for virtual currency, and seeing whether this information may be accepted despite being fraudulent in nature, this paper elucidates the reliability of information that law enforcement bodies may be able to access when tracing transactions back to an individual actor.

AB Ethereum, the well-known blockchain platform, does not have any limit for block size, unlike Bitcoin. However, there are other obstacles in processing unlimited transactions per second. Ethereum blockchain code runs by different clients, and they run on different speed and present the different level of performance. This paper studies Ethereum transactions and it analyzes two most popular Ethereum clients, Geth and Parity, on a private blockchain to obtain the better understanding of the effect of different clients on Ethereum performance. The results show that the transactions are 89.8 percent on average faster in Parity client in comparison with Geth client, using the same system configuration.

AB Bitcoin's underlying blockchain database is a novel approach to recordkeeping that has the potential to decentralize big data. Bitcoin's success has inspired a multitude of spinoff projects hoping to use blockchain as a distributed database for records-management innovation in other fields. Misconceptions and exaggerations about blockchain and its capabilities are pervasive in the media. Drawing on perspectives from archival science, dependable computing, and secure computing, this paper surveys current applications, research, and critiques of blockchain to provide an objective assessment of its benefits and limitations. Based on the findings of the survey, this paper proposes three criteria that predict success for blockchain-based data management projects, briefly: dependability, security, and trust.

AB Recently, blockchains have been gathering a lot of interest. Many applications can benefit from the advantages of blockchains. Nevertheless, applications with more restricted privacy or participation requirements cannot rely on public blockchains. First, the whole blockchain can be downloaded at any time, thus making the data available to the public. Second, anyone can deploy a node, join the blockchain network and take part in the consensus building process. Private and consortium blockchains promise to combine the advantages of blockchains with stricter requirements on the participating entities. This is also the reason for the comparably small number of nodes that store and extend those blockchains. However, by targeting specific nodes, an attacker can influence how consensuses are reached and possibly even halt the blockchain operation. To provide additional security to the blockchain nodes, ChainGuard utilizes SDN functionalities to filter network traffic, thus implementing a firewall for blockchain applications. ChainGuard communicates with the blockchain nodes it guards to determine which origin of the traffic is legitimate. Packets from illegitimate sources are intercepted and thus cannot have an effect on the blockchain. As is shown with experiments, ChainGuard provides access control functionality and can effectively mitigate flooding attacks from several sources at once.

AB Bugs severely hurt blockchain system dependability. A thorough understanding of blockchain bug characteristics is required to design effective tools for preventing, detecting and mitigating hugs. We perform an empirical study on hug characteristics in eight representative open source blockchain systems. First, we manually examine 1,108 bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs. Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports, and obtain ten hug categories in blockchain systems. We further investigate the frequency distribution of bug categories across projects and programming languages. Finally, we study the relationship between hug categories and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic hugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency distributions of bug types show similar trends across different projects and programming languages; (3) security hugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4) 35.71% performance bugs are fixed in more than one year; performance bugs take the longest average time to be fixed.

TI Double-spend Attack Models with Time Advantange for Bitcoin
SO ELECTRONIC NOTES IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB Bitcoin is a digital currency in which the need for a trusted third party is avoided. Instead, this digital currency is based on the concept of 'proof of work' allowing users to execute payments by digitally signing their transactions. Since electronic files can be duplicated, fraudulent transactions in the form of double-spend attacks - where users spend the same money at least twice - can happen. This paper is about attack models that can assign possible time advantage to attacker agents in the Bitcoin network. In particular, this paper presents: (i) two attack models in which partial advancement towards block production can be influenced by time and not only by the hashpower used to produce blocks of hashes, and (ii) algorithmic experimentation comparing these models against existing well-known hashrate-based attack models that do not consider time advantage. As a conclusion, this paper presents evidence on the fact that advantages are not negligible for cases in which an attacker has had enough time for secretly mining fraudulent blocks or significant control over the network. Also, the models presented in this paper help in supporting previous claims in the literature about how to correctly model and detect double-spend attacks in the Bitcoin network.

AB In this work we address the problem of coordinated consumption shifting for electricity prosumers. We show that individual optimization with respect to electricity prices does not always lead to minimized costs, thus necessitating a cooperative approach. A prosumer cooperative employs an internal cryptocurrency mechanism for coordinating members decisions and distributing the collectively generated profits. The mechanism generates cryptocoins in a distributed fashion, and awards them to participants according to various criteria, such as contribution impact and accuracy between stated and final shifting actions. In particular, when a scoring rules-based distribution method is employed, participants are incentivized to be accurate. When tested on a large dataset with real-world production and consumption data, our approach is shown to provide incentives for accurate statements and increased economic profits for the cooperative.

AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the blockchain and, in general, Peer-to-Peer approaches could play an important role in the development of decentralized and data-intensive applications running on billion of devices, preserving the privacy of the users. Our research goal is to understand whether the blockchain and Peer-to-Peer approaches can be employed to foster a decentralized and private-by-design IoT. As a first step in our research process, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review on the blockchain to gather knowledge on the current uses of this technology and to document its current degree of integrity, anonymity and adaptability. We found 18 use cases of blockchain in the literature. Four of these use cases are explicitly designed for IoT. We also found some use cases that are designed for a private-by-design data management. We also found several issues in the integrity, anonymity and adaptability. Regarding anonymity, we found that in the blockchain only pseudonymity is guaranteed. Regarding adaptability and integrity, we discovered that the integrity of the blockchain largely depends on the high difficulty of the Proof-of-Work and on the large number of honest miners, but at the same time a difficult Proof-of-Work limits the adaptability. We documented and categorized the current uses of the blockchain, and provided a few recommendations for future work to address the above-mentioned issues.

SO TRIPLEC-COMMUNICATION CAPITALISM & CRITIQUE
AB Many commentators have been quick to note the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin 2.0 technology, with some even believing that it represents the coming of a decentralized autonomous society in which humans are freed from centralized forms of power and control. Influenced by neoliberal theory, these individuals are implicitly working on the assumption that 'freedom' means freedom from the state. This neglects that the state can also provide freedom from the vagaries of the market by protecting certain things from commodification. Through an analysis of (1) class and the role of the state; (2) the concentration and centralization of capital; and (3) automation, I argue that the vision of freedom that underpins Bitcoin 2.0 tech is one that neglects the power that capital holds over us. In neglecting this power, I claim that this technology might be far more dystopian than we comprehend, making possible societies that are commodities all the way down.

AB Digital currencies like Bitcoin rely on cryptographic primitives to operate. However, past experience shows that cryptographic primitives do not last forever: increased computational power and advanced cryptanalysis cause primitives to break frequently, and motivate the development of new ones. It is therefore crucial for maintaining trust in a cryptocurrency to anticipate such breakage.
   We present the first systematic analysis of the effect of broken primitives on Bitcoin. We identify the core cryptographic building blocks and analyze the ways in which they can break, and the subsequent effect on the main Bitcoin security guarantees. Our analysis reveals a wide range of possible effects depending on the primitive and type of breakage, ranging from minor privacy violations to a complete breakdown of the currency. Our results lead to several observations on, and suggestions for, the Bitcoin migration plans in case of broken or weakened cryptographic primitives.

AB Motivated by the impossibility of achieving fairness in secure computation [Cleve, STOC 1986], recent works study a model of fairness in which an adversarial party that aborts on receiving output is forced to pay a mutually predefined monetary penalty to every other party that did not receive the output. These works show how to design protocols for secure computation with penalties that guarantees that either fairness is guaranteed or that each honest party obtains a monetary penalty from the adversary. Protocols for this task are typically designed in an hybrid model where parties have access to a "claim-or-refund" transaction functionality denote F-CR*.
   In this work, we obtain improvements on the efficiency of these constructions by amortizing the cost over multiple executions of secure computation with penalties. More precisely, for computational security parameter lambda, we design a protocol that implements l = poly (lambda) instances of secure computation with penalties where the total number of calls to F-CR* is independent of l.

AB BITCOIN is a novel decentralized cryptocurrency system which has recently received a great attention from a wider audience. An interesting and unique feature of this system is that the complete list of all the transactions occurred from its inception is publicly available. This enables the investigation of funds movements to uncover interesting properties of the BITCOIN economy. In this paper we present a set of analyses of the user graph, i.e. the graph obtained by an heuristic clustering of the graph of BITCOIN transactions. Our analyses consider an up-to-date BITCOIN blockchain, as in December 2015, after the exponential explosion of the number of transactions occurred in the last two years. The set of analyses we defined includes, among others, the analysis of the time evolution of BITCOIN network, the verification of the "rich get richer" conjecture and the detection of the nodes which are critical for the network connectivity.

AB Flooding Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks form the basis of services such as the electronic currency system Bitcoin. The decentralized architecture enables robustness against failure. However, knowledge of the network's topology can allow adversaries to attack specific peers in order to, e.g., isolate certain peers or even partition the network. Knowledge of the topology might be gained by observing the flooding process, which is inherently possible in such networks, and performing a timing analysis on the observations. In this paper we present a timing analysis method that targets flooding P2P networks and show its theoretical and practical feasibility. A validation in the real-world Bitcoin network proves the possibility of inferring network links of actively participating peers with substantial precision and recall (both similar to 40 %), potentially enabling attacks on the network. Additionally, we analyze the countermeasure of trickling and quantify the tradeoff between the effectiveness of the countermeasure and the expected performance penalty. The analysis shows that inappropriate parametrization can actually facilitate inference attacks.

TI Bitcoin: Risks and Controls
SO JOURNAL OF CORPORATE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCE
AB Proponents hype the benefits of Bitcoin transactions as being faster and cheaper than traditional methods; however, concerns around the lack of a central governing agency, lack of controls over Bitcoin exchanges, and the volatility of the virtual currency persist. Therefore, a company's use of Bitcoin, as a medium of exchange or as an investment, involves risks and internal control concerns that merit careful consideration. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This paper sets out a brief, deliberately non-technical, overview of Bitcoin, a new, but becoming more mainstream, crypto currency, generated and managed by a distributed multi-agent system. Bitcoin was developed in late 2008 by "Satoshi Nakamoto". The nature of Bitcoin as a disruptive currency, payments system and asset, is juxtaposed against the potential for its transactional ledger, the blockchain, to usher in a revolutionary way of recording "digital truth". The main contribution of this paper is to progress the debate around Bitcoin beyond the technical and towards legal and ethical issues and the nature of money and memory itself.

TI Traitor Deterring Schemes: Using Bitcoin as Collateral for Digital

AB We put forth a new cryptographic primitive called a Traitor Deterring Scheme (TDS). A TDS is a multi-recipient public key encryption scheme where an authority issues decryption keys to a set of users. The distinguishing feature of a TDS is that secret-keys are issued only after the users provide some private information as a form of collateral. The traitor deterring property ensures that if a malicious coalition of users (aka "traitors") produces an unauthorized (aka "pirate") decryption device, any recipient of the device will be able to recover at least one of the traitors' collaterals with only black box access to the device. On the other hand, honest users' collaterals are guaranteed to remain hidden. In this fashion a TDS deincentivizes malicious behavior among users. We model, construct and analyze TDS's based on various cryptographic assumptions and we show how bitcoin can be used as collateral for real world deployment of TDS's for the distribution of digital content. Along the way, we present cryptographic building blocks that may be of independent interest, namely fuzzy lockers, and comparison predicate encryption schemes for exponentially large domains. We also compare TDS with previous primitives specifically traitor tracing schemes (TTS) introduced by Chor et al. [9] and digital signets for self enforcement introduced by Dwork et al. [12]. A TDS constitutes a strict strengthening of a TTS and, when modeled in what we call the "known ciphertext model", it is a reformulation of digital signets in the public key, black-box secure setting. In digital signets the adversary attempts to transmit a pirate copy at a favorable "space rate", i.e., without having to send the whole plaintext (and without revealing the traitor collaterals). It is an open question from [12] to construct o(1) space rate schemes under a falsifiable assumption. With our TDS constructions we resolve this open question showing feasibility for space rates

TI Virtual currency schemes - the future of financial services
SO FORESIGHT
AB Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to determine the future role of virtual currencies. This paper indicates their pros and cons as alternatives to "real" money and explains their appearance as the reflection of the present trends. It also presents the possible scenarios of their development.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the former foresight research results and literature review. It highlights the main trends in contemporary economy and their impact on financial services. The Bitcoin case is the starting point for the virtual currencies' market analysis and construction of possible market changes scenarios.
   Findings - Virtual currency schemes are the reflection of present trends. They are just ahead of our times but may become a common means of payment, changing the way of providing financial services, eliminating intermediaries and marginalizing the role of financial institutions.
   Research limitations/implications - The multiplicity of virtual currencies and ceaseless introduction of innovations impede the presentation of the complete market picture. The lack of reliable statistical data makes the estimation of the market growth difficult.
   Practical implications - This paper indicates influence of technology development, virtualization and networking on payment systems' functioning.
   Social implications - This paper shows the impact of environmental changes on consumers' acceptance of virtual currencies.
   Originality/value - The virtual currency as a payment system is quite new and still a marginalized phenomenon. Nevertheless, the pace of virtual currency market growth after its recent introduction and appearance of Bitcoin successors seems to be the signs of future changes in financial service sector.

TI Day Hospital Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT-DH) versus treatment as
   usual in the treatment of severe borderline personality disorder:
   protocol of a randomized controlled trial
SO BMC PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Severe borderline personality disorder is associated with a very high psychosocial and economic burden. Current treatment guidelines suggest that several manualized treatments, including day hospital Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT-DH), are effective in these patients. However, only two randomized controlled trials have compared manualized MBT-DH with treatment as usual. Given the relative paucity of data supporting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH, the possible influence of researcher allegiance in one of the trials, and potential problems with the generalization of findings to mental health systems in other countries, this multi-site randomized trial aims to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of manualized MBT-DH compared to manualized specialist treatment as usual in The Netherlands.
   Methods/design: The trial is being conducted at two sites in The Netherlands. Patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and a score of >= 20 on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index were randomly allocated to MBT-DH or treatment as usual. The MBT-DH program consists of a maximum of 18 months' intensive treatment, followed by a maximum of 18 months of maintenance therapy. Specialist treatment as usual is provided by the City Crisis Service in Amsterdam, a service that specializes in treating patients with personality disorders, offering manualized, non-MBT interventions including family interventions, Linehan training, social skills training, and pharmacotherapy, without a maximum time limit. Patients are assessed at baseline and subsequently every 6 months up to 36 months after the start of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the frequency and severity of manifestations of borderline personality disorder as assessed by the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal behaviour, symptomatic distress, social and interpersonal functioning, personality functioning, attachment, capacity for mentalizing and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness is assessed in terms of the cost per quality-adjusted life year. Outcomes will be analyzed using multilevel analyses based on intention-to-treat principles.
   Discussion: Severe borderline personality disorder is a serious psychological disorder that is associated with high burden. This multi-site randomized trial will provide further data concerning the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH for these patients.

AB Bitcoin is a new protocol with a potential to revolutionize financial system. Bitcoin has a complex structure, where several interacting components build a peer-to-peer currency and a payment system without relying on any trusted third party. Bitcoin is continually improved by an open source community, and various Bitcoin libraries, APIs, and alternative implementations are being developed. Nevertheless, there is no up-to-date protocol specification or architecture description since the official whitepaper was published back in 2008. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date protocol specification and architectural analysis of the Bitcoin system. We perform this analysis as the first step towards specification of the cryptocurrency reference architecture. The future reference architecture will serve as a starting architectural point for the development of new systems that leverage Bitcoin protocol in different contexts and for various purposes. We also discuss whether the current architecture satisfies the system's primary purpose, i.e., providing a pure decentralized version of the cryptocurrency.

TI Normal personality versus pathological personality: dimensional and
   predictive study
SO PERSONALITY AND MENTAL HEALTH
AB The present study aimed to replicate the previous relationship between the Zuckerman personality model and the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) and to evaluate the contribution of the facets and factors from Zuckerman's new instrument Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire (ZKA-PQ) versus the old Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire to the four clusters of the DAPP-BQ. The sample consisted of 443 subjects from the general population of both sexes. The ZKA-PQ dimensions predicted between 35% and 61% of the DAPP-BQ cluster variance and facets between 54% and 63%. Local regression graphical analysis (LOESS) showed that neuroticism and aggressiveness are the dimensions most related with emotional dysregulation. Sensation seeking and aggressiveness were associated with dissocial behaviour. Neuroticism and extraversion (negative) were associated with social avoidance and activity and sensation seeking (negative) with compulsiveness. The new ZKA-PQ improves the psychometric properties of the old Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire. Both dimensional personality measures can play a role in the prediction of the future DSM-V personality disorder dimensional system. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Stability of personality pathology in delinquent juveniles
SO KINDHEIT UND ENTWICKLUNG
AB In this follow up study, the stability of dimensional assessed personality pathology was investigated in a sample of formerly incarcerated female and male adolescents in the course of one and a half years. On average, 17.1 months after the first investigation, seventy-one female and male juveniles from a cohort of formerly incarcerated subjects were assessed with the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). In order to answer the question of a significant change of mean values over time, a univariate variance analysis with repeated measurement and rang correlations was calculated. The DAPP subscales of Cognitive Distortion, Affective Lability, Suspiciousness, Insecure Attachment, Stimulus Seeking, and Callousness were found to be stable. In contrast there was a significant change of mean values regarding identity problems, oppositionality, self harm, and conduct problems. Our results were in line with recent longitudinal studies. Personality dimensions that were described by other authors as "dysfunctional behavior" were found to be stable, whereas more stable results were found for personality traits such as affective lability and callousness. These findings indicate that also in a high risk population of delinquent adolescents the construct of personality consists of stable and unstable elements. The clinical implications are discussed.

TI Spring-block model for a single-lane highway traffic
SO CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
AB A simple one-dimensional spring-block chain with asymmetric interactions is considered to model an idealized single-lane highway traffic. The main elements of the system are blocks (modeling cars), springs with unidirectional interactions (modeling distance-keeping interactions between neighbors), static and kinetic friction (modeling inertia of drivers and cars) and spatiotemporal disorder in the values of these friction forces (modeling differences in the driving attitudes). The traveling chain of cars correspond to the dragged spring-block system. Contrary to most of the studies in the field of highway traffic here we focus on a measure characteristic for one car in the row. Our statistical analysis for the spring-block chain predicts a non-trivial and rich complex behavior. As a function of the disorder level in the system a dynamic phase-transition is observed. For low disorder levels uncorrelated slidings of blocks are revealed while for high disorder levels correlated avalanches dominates.

TI Schizotypy and pathological personality profile in siblings of patients
   with psychosis
SO PSICOTHEMA
AB Schizotypy has been proposed to be the expression of the genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia. Schizotypal features have been associated with personality dimensions found in patients with psychosis. In this study, we compared the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology - Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) scores of patients with psychosis, siblings scoring higher on schizotypy (SSHS), and siblings scoring lower (SSLS). The SSHSs displayed a DAPP-BQ profile characterized by high scores in the dimensions of affective lability, anxiousness, submissiveness, social avoidance, identity problems, oppositionality, narcissism, and restricted expression, distinguishing them from the SSLS. Due to these dimensions, SSHSs are more similar to the patients' DAPP-BQ profile. The results suggest that this pathological personality profile might contribute to increase the risk of developing psychosis in siblings who have more schizotypal features.

AB A series of tri-block copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and 6-O-methacryloyl-1,2;3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-D-galactopyranose (MAIPGal) were synthesized by sequential atom transfer radical polymerization ( ATRP) of MMA and MAIPGal,using 4,4'-biphenol di(2-bromoisobutyrate) (BIBBP) as the initiator. The chemical composition and molecular weights of the copolymers were characterized by (1)H-NMR and GPC. It was demonstrated that the block chain length of both PM MA and PMAIPGal can be tuned by the feed molar ratio and monomer conversion. After de-protecting the isopropylidene groups of PMAIPGal, amphiphilic tri-block copolymers were obtained. Their self-assembly behavior in water was investigated by TEM We investigated the effects of polymer structure, composition and initial concentration in good solvents on the final morphologies of the aggregates. For BAB copolymers, with the hydrophobic PM MA in the center. when the hydrophilic PGA was short, they tended to form vesicle like assemblies at lower polymer concentration. Increasing the chain length of the PGA chain, huge irregular micelles were obtained For ABA copolymers, small sized micelles were the main morphologies, but they were connected with each other due to the interaction of the PGA segments The difference of self-assembly behavior was attributed to the polymer structure, which dominates the molecular packing as well as the chain segregation of the glycopolymer chains.

TI Decentralized P2P Energy Trading Under Network Constraints in a
   Low-Voltage Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID
AB The increasing uptake of distributed energy resources in distribution systems and the rapid advance of technology have established new scenarios in the operation of low-voltage networks. In particular, recent trends in cryptocurrencies and blockchain have led to a proliferation of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading schemes, which allow the exchange of energy between the neighbors without any intervention of a conventional intermediary in the transactions. Nevertheless, far too little attention has been paid to the technical constraints of the network under this scenario. A major challenge to implementing P2P energy trading is ensuring network constraints are not violated during the energy exchange. This paper proposes a methodology based on sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of P2P transactions on the network and to guarantee an exchange of energy that does not violate network constraints. The proposed method is tested on a typical U.K. low-voltage network. The results show that our method ensures that energy is exchanged between users under the P2P scheme without violating the network constraints, and that users can still capture the economic benefits of the P2P architecture.

In this paper, we explore different consumer utility driven operations models and highlight the values of blockchain technology supported (BTS) platforms for diamond authentication and certification. We build models and analytically examine both the traditional retail network operations (Model R) and the BTS selling platform (Model PL). We further extend the analysis to study the case with the BTS certification platform (Model BCR). We reveal the conditions under which one model outperforms the others. In particular, we note that the shopping convenience utility offered by the traditional retailers is a critical factor determining which model is the best Finally, for the BTS platform operations, we study the blockchain-technology-based diamond authentication and certification (BDAC) cost and reveal that reducing it is beneficial to all parties in the luxury supply chain.

TI Review of blockchain-based distributed energy: Implications for
   institutional development
SO RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB The future of energy is complex, with fluctuating renewable resources in increasingly distributed systems. It is suggested that blockchain technology is a timely innovation with potential to facilitate this future. Peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrids can support renewable energy as well as economically empower consumers and prosumers. However, the rapid development of blockchain and prospects for P2P energy networks is coupled with several grey areas in the institutional landscape. The purpose of this paper is to holistically explore potential challenges of blockchain-based P2P microgrids, and propose practical implications for institutional development as well as academia. An analytical framework for P2P microgrids is developed based on literature review as well as expert interviews. The framework incorporates 1) Technological, 2) Economic, 3) Social, 4) Environmental and 5) Institutional dimensions. Directions for future work in practical and academic contexts are identified. It is suggested that bridging the gap from technological to institutional readiness would require the incorporation of all dimensions as well as their inter-relatedness. Gradual institutional change leveraging community-building and regulatory sandbox approaches are proposed as potential pathways in incorporating this multi-dimensionality, reducing cross-sectoral silos, and facilitating interoperability between current and future systems. By offering insight through holistic conceptualization, this paper aims to contribute to expanding research in building the pillars of a more substantiated institutional arch for blockchain in the energy sector.

AB The relationship between conventional and digital assets has become a prominent research topic, a focus partially emerging from the establishment of some large cryptocurrencies as legitimate financial assets. In this paper, we examine the information interdependence among various commodities-such as energy, metals and agricultural commodities-and leading cryptocurrencies. We use a time-varying entropy-based approach to identify the direction of return spillovers, and the results show that the nature of information spillovers changes over time, with cryptocurrencies becoming more connected and more prominent within the system; in contrast, the role of energy commodities is dependent on their price dynamics. We also apply a minimum spanning tree (MST) and various centrality measures, which reveal that agricultural and energy commodities form the core of the commodities network. The basic skeleton of the network remains rather stable over time even though the detailed connections are rather volatile. Our findings generally suggest that cryptocurrencies are integrated within broadly-defined commodity markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Herding behavior and contagion in the cryptocurrency market
SO JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL FINANCE
AB This study aimed to analyze herding behavior and contagion phenomena in the cryptocurrency market. We selected 50 of the most liquid and capitalized currencies in the period from March 2015 to November 2018 (daily data). The methodology used for detecting herding behavior comprised adaptations of the cross-sectional absolute deviation (CSAD) and cross-sectional standard deviation (CSSD) tests, as well as Hwang and Salmon's (2004) model. For the contagion effect, we utilized adaptations of Forbes and Rigobon's (2002) (FR) test, and FR test extensions based on the comoments of Fry, Martin, and Tang (2010) and Fry-McKibbin and Hsiao (2018). The results of using the CSSD test and Hwang and Salmon's (2004) state space model revealed herding behavior, demonstrating extreme periods of adverse herd behavior. As regards the contagion effect, the modified FR test and its extensions with comoments were able to identify the Bitcoin contagion in other currencies in almost all cases. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Cloud/Fog Computing Resource Management and Pricing for Blockchain
   Networks
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Public blockchain networks using proof of work (PoW)-based consensus protocols are considered as a promising platform for decentralized resource management with financial incentive mechanisms. In order to maintain a secured, universal state of the blockchain, PoW-based consensus protocols financially incentivize the nodes in the network to compete for the privilege of block generation through cryptographic puzzle solving. For rational consensus nodes, i.e., miners with limited local computational resources, offloading the computation load for PoW to the cloud/fog providers (CFPs) becomes a viable option. In this paper, we study the interaction between the CFPs and the miners in a PoW-based blockchain network using a game theoretic approach. In particular, we propose a lightweight infrastructure of the PoW-based blockchains, where the computation-intensive part of the consensus process is offloaded to the cloud/fog. We formulate the computation resource management in the blockchain consensus process as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the profit of the CFP and the utilities of the individual miners are jointly optimized. In the first stage of the game, the CFP sets the price of offered computing resource. In the second stage, the miners decide on the amount of service to purchase accordingly. We apply backward induction to analyze the subgame perfect equilibria in each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For uniform pricing where the same price applies to all miners, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is validated by identifying the best response strategies of the miners. For discriminatory pricing where the different prices are applied, the uniqueness of the Stackelberg equilibrium is proved by capitalizing on the variational inequality theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our proposed model.

TI It's real, trust me! Establishing supply chain provenance using
   blockchain
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB In a global marketplace, customers are often unaware of the exact sources of the products they purchase and consume. To address this lack of awareness, blockchain technology can be implemented in supply chains to increase customers' knowledge of products' provenance. Provenance knowledge information about products' origin, production, modifications, and custody enables customers to be assured of their purchasing decisions. This assurance comes from information on the origin, authenticity, custody, and integrity of the product that helps reduce risk perceptions. We develop a provenance knowledge framework and show how its application can enhance assurances and reduce perceived risks via the application of blockchain. We present a guide on how to implement blockchain to establish provenance knowledge and close with a kind warning on the importance of demonstrating the value of blockchain to customers.

TI Making sense of blockchain technology: How will it transform supply
   chains?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS
AB This research uses sensemaking theory to explore how emerging blockchain technology may transform supply chains. We investigate three research questions (RQs): What are blockchain technology's perceived benefits to supply chains, where are disruptions mostly likely to occur and what are the potential challenges to further blockchain diffusion? We conducted in-depth interviews with 14 supply chain experts. Cognitive mapping and narrative analysis were deployed as the two main data analysis techniques to aid our understanding and evaluation of people's cognitive complexity in making sense of blockchain technology. We found that individual experts developed different cognitive structures within their own sensemaking processes. After merging individual cognitive maps into a strategic map, we identified several themes and central concepts that then allowed us to explore potential answers to the three RQs. Our study is among the very few to date to explicitly explore how blockchains may transform supply chain practices. Using the sensemaking approach afforded a deeper understanding of how senior executives diagnose the symptoms evident from blockchains and develop assumptions, expectations and knowledge of the technology, which will then shape their future actions regarding its utilisation. We demonstrate the usefulness of sensemaking theory as an alternative lens in investigating contemporary supply chain phenomena such as blockchains. Bringing sensemaking theory to this discipline in particular enriches emerging behavioural operations research. Our contributions also lie in extending the theories of prospective sensemaking and adding further insights to the stream of technology adoption studies.

We find statistically significant diversification benefits from the inclusion of Bitcoin which are more pronounced for commodities. Most importantly, the decrease in the overall portfolio risk due to the low correlation of Bitcoin with other assets is not offset by its high volatility. However, the inclusion of Bitcoin pays off little if investors accommodate a battery of economic instruments. Considering non-bubble conditions that are not marked by explosive prices in cryptocurrencies, we document substantially diminished benefits.

SO BMC MEDICINE
AB Blockchain is a shared distributed digital ledger technology that can better facilitate data management, provenance and security, and has the potential to transform healthcare. Importantly, blockchain represents a data architecture, whose application goes far beyond Bitcoin - the cryptocurrency that relies on blockchain and has popularized the technology. In the health sector, blockchain is being aggressively explored by various stakeholders to optimize business processes, lower costs, improve patient outcomes, enhance compliance, and enable better use of healthcare-related data. However, critical in assessing whether blockchain can fulfill the hype of a technology characterized as revolutionary' and disruptive', is the need to ensure that blockchain design elements consider actual healthcare needs from the diverse perspectives of consumers, patients, providers, and regulators. In addition, answering the real needs of healthcare stakeholders, blockchain approaches must also be responsive to the unique challenges faced in healthcare compared to other sectors of the economy. In this sense, ensuring that a health blockchain is fit-for-purpose' is pivotal. This concept forms the basis for this article, where we share views from a multidisciplinary group of practitioners at the forefront of blockchain conceptualization, development, and deployment.

TI An optimal scheduling algorithm for hybrid EV charging scenario using
   consortium blockchains
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB In this paper, we propose an optimal charging scheduling algorithm for hybrid vehicle charging scenarios. Unlike traditional charging scheduling algorithms, which only consider the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) scenarios, the new and hybrid charging scenario including the emerging mobile charging vehicles (MCV), i.e. mobile charging vehicle-to-vehicle (MCV2V), G2V and V2V is considered in this paper. Moreover, the proposed optimal charging scheduling framework based on consortium blockchains ensures the security and privacy of electricity trading. The proposed scheduling algorithm is based on a double-objective optimization model aiming at maximizing user's satisfaction and minimizing users' cost, while considering diverse metrics like location of charging and discharging entities, the time of waiting, and driving speed of EVs, etc. In order to solve the optimization model, an improved Non dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) is proposed. Experiments based on the real map of Beijing is done to evaluate the performance of proposed scheduling algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance in terms of user's satisfaction and user's cost comparing with V2V based algorithm and G2V based algorithm.

The distribution of Bitcoin returns and volatility display a fat right tail and high central parts. Bitcoin does not show the dynamic property of volatility persistence, contrary to stylized facts in financial time series. Also, the autoregressive model using past volatility does not well work in predicting changes in Bitcoin volatility for future periods. Investor sentiment regarding Bitcoin has a significant information value for explaining changes in Bitcoin volatility for future periods. These results suggest that Bitcoin appears to be an investment asset with high volatility and dependence on investor sentiment rather than a monetary asset. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Blockchain is a technological concept which evolves from the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, and disrupts constantly enlarging areas of economy. The concept of blockchain is developing, and while the future of Bitcoin remains unclear (as it is for the most elements of the economy) it is evident that the blockchain holds enormous potential for large-scale improvements. However, being a technology that could decrease significance many of today's large global corporations, institutions and power structures which have keen interest in preserving established hierarchies, its potential could well remain unexploited. This paper aims to introduce and present the concept of blockchain and its current applications in logistics and supply networks. Blockchain technology promises overpowering trust issues and allowing trustless, secure and authenticated system of logistics and supply chain information exchange in supply networks. The new implementations within supply chain are shifting from blockchain to a wider notion of distributed ledger technologies. Paper presents description and rationale behind current and possible future applications of blockchain in logistics and supply chain.

TI Combating Deepfake Videos Using Blockchain and Smart Contracts
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques, fake digital contents have proliferated in recent years. Fake footage, images, audios, and videos (known as deepfakes) can be a scary and dangerous phenomenon and can have the potential of altering the truth and eroding trust by giving false reality. Proof of authenticity (PoA) of digital media is critical to help eradicate the epidemic of forged content. Current solutions lack the ability to provide history tracking and provenance of digital media. In this paper, we provide a solution and a general framework using Ethereum smart contracts to trace and track the provenance and history of digital content to its original source even if the digital content is copied multiple times. The smart contract utilizes the hashes of the interplanetary file system (IPFS) used to store digital content and its metadata. Our solution focuses on video content, but the solution framework provided in this paper is generic enough and can be applied to any other form of digital content. Our solution relies on the principle that if the content can be credibly traced to a trusted or reputable source, the content can then be real and authentic. The full code of the smart contract has been made publicly available at Github.

SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB The mechanism for traditional searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) is pay-then-use. This situation is not fair to user because the cloud server may return wrong results. Besides, the user needs to verify these results locally. In order to ensure fairness and reduce user's calculations, we combined blockchain with SSE, and proposed a fair SSE scheme based on blockchain. Our scheme can guarantee fairness for both parties. That is, if the user is not honest, he cannot get right results from the server, and at the same time the server cannot get any information related to the plaintexts during this search process. If the server is not honest, except for the service charge, it will be punished automatically. Moreover, the user in our scheme does not need to verify the results locally. The security and performance analyses showed our scheme was semantic secure and feasible. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Ultralightweight Mutual Authentication RFID Protocol for Blockchain
   Enabled Supply Chains
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Previous research studies mostly focused on enhancing the security of radio frequency identification (RFID) protocols for various RFID applications that rely on a centralized database. However, blockchain technology is quickly emerging as a novel distributed and decentralized alternative that provides higher data protection, reliability, immutability, transparency, and lower management costs compared with a conventional centralized database. These properties make it extremely suitable for integration in a supply chain management system. In order to successfully fuse RFID and blockchain technologies together, a secure method of communication is required between the RFID tagged goods and the blockchain nodes. Therefore, this paper proposes a robust ultra-lightweight mutual authentication RFID protocol that works together with a decentralized database to create a secure blockchain-enabled supply chain management system. Detailed security analysis is performed to prove that the proposed protocol is secure from key disclosure, replay, man-in-the-middle, de-synchronization, and tracking attacks. In addition to that, a formal analysis is conducted using Gong, Needham, and Yahalom logic and automated validation of internet security protocols and applications tool to verify the security of the proposed protocol. The protocol is proven to be efficient with respect to storage, computational, and communication costs. In addition to that, a further step is taken to ensure the robustness of the protocol by analyzing the probability of data collision written to the blockchain.

TI Can cryptocurrencies fulfil the functions of money?
SO QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND FINANCE
AB This paper analyses the monetary characteristics of five cryptocurrencies to evaluate whether they can perform the functions of money. While all cryptocurrencies can theoretically and practically serve as a medium of exchange, they are unlikely to become common and liquid media of exchange unless they can illustrate utility in one of the other functions of money. Digital currencies' rigidly inflexible supply and wildly fluctuating demand make them too unstable to be used as a unit of account for the foreseeable future. Of the five, only Bitcoin has the potential to serve as a store of value, due to its strict commitment to low supply growth, credibly backed by the network's distributed protocol and credible demonstration of the absence of any authority capable of altering the supply schedule. Other cryptocurrencies' centralized control, and use as tokens for specific applications make them unlikely to fulfil monetary functions. (C) 2018 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

TI Liquidity uncertainty and Bitcoin's market microstructure
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB This paper provides a novel measure of liquidity uncertainty for Bitcoin using bid-ask spread data from Bitfinex - one of the largest and most liquid Bitcoin exchanges. This measure can be used to analyze liquidity developments in Bitcoin exchanges or to gauge the immediacy associated with buying or selling Bitcoin. It then proceeds to identify what aspects of Bitcoin's market microstructure can explain the time series behavior of this liquidity uncertainty. The estimation results are based on a Markov regime switching model that captures episodes of high and low liquidity uncertainty for Bitcoin over the period from October 2013 to March 2018.

TI Integrating dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and
   diffusion kurtosis imaging for neoadjuvant chemotherapy assessment of
   nasopharyngeal carcinoma
SO JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
AB Background: Since neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has proven a benefit for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), early response evaluation after chemotherapy is important to implement individualized therapy for NPC in the era of precision medicine.
   Purpose: To determine the combined and independent contribution between dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the early monitoring of NAC response for NPC.
   Study Type: Prospective.
   Population: Fifty-three locally advanced NPC patients.
   Field Strength/Sequence: Four examinations before and at 4, 20, and 40 days after NAC initiation were performed at 3T MRI including DCE-MRI and DKI (b values=0, 500, 1000, 1500 s/mm(2)).
   Assessment: DCE-MRI parameters (K-trans [the volume transfer constant of Gd-DTPA], k(ep) [rate constant], v(e) [the extracellular volume fraction of the imaged tissue], and v(p) [the blood volume fraction]) and DKI parameters (D-app [apparent diffusion for non-Gaussian distribution] and K-app [apparent kurtosis coefficient]) were analyzed using dedicated software.
   Statistical Tests: MRI parameters and their corresponding changes were compared between responders and nonresponders after one or two NAC cycles treatment using independent-samples Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test depending on the normality contribution test and then followed by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analyses.
   Results: The responder group (RG) patients presented significantly higher mean K-trans and D-app values at baseline and larger Delta K-(0-4)(trans,) Delta v(p(0-4)), and Delta Dapp(0-4) values after either one or two NAC cycles compared with the nonresponder group (NRG) patients (all P < 0.05). ROC analyses demonstrated the higher diagnostic accuracy of combined DCE-MRI and DKI model to distinguish nonresponders from responders after two NAC cycles than using DCE-MRI (0.987 vs. 0.872, P=0.033) or DKI (0.987 vs. 0.898, P=0.047) alone.
   Data Conclusion: Combined DCE-MRI and DKI models had higher diagnostic accuracy for NAC assessment compared with either model used independently.
   Level of Evidence: 2
   Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2018;47:1208-1216.

TI BeeKeeper 2.0: Confidential Blockchain-Enabled IoT System with Fully
   Homomorphic Computation
SO SENSORS
AB Blockchain-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) systems have received extensive attention from academia and industry. Most previous constructions face the risk of leaking sensitive information since the servers can obtain plaintext data from the devices. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a decentralized outsourcing computation (DOC) scheme, where the servers can perform fully homomorphic computations on encrypted data from the data owner according to the request of the data owner. In this process, the servers cannot obtain any plaintext data, and dishonest servers can be detected by the data owner. Then, we apply the DOC scheme in the IoT scenario to achieve a confidential blockchain-enabled IoT system, called BeeKeeper 2.0. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which servers of a blockchain-enabled IoT system can perform any-degree homomorphic multiplications and any number of additions on encrypted data from devices according to the requests of the devices without obtaining any plaintext data of the devices. Finally, we provide a detailed performance evaluation for the BeeKeeper 2.0 system by deploying it on Hyperledger Fabric and using Hyperledger Caliper for performance testing. According to our tests, the time consumed between the request stage and recover stage is no more than 3.3 s, which theoretically satisfies the production needs.

TI The impact of Tether grants on Bitcoin
SO ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB In recent years, Tether issuances (or 'grants') have increased significantly, which correlated broadly with a significant rise in Bitcoin valuation. This paper examines the impact of cryptocurrency issuances on subsequent cryptocurrency returns. It is argued that as Tether is the undisputed 'stable coin', the minting of new Tether acts similarly to monetary expansion in cryptocurrency markets, inflating the prices of Bitcoin. We construct a VAR model and show contrary to investor expectations, Tether issuances do not impact subsequent Bitcoin returns, however, they do impact traded volumes. We also document an increase in Tether trading following a subsequent decrease in Bitcoin returns. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Nonextensive triplets in cryptocurrency exchanges
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Cryptocurrencies represent a new type of financial assets that are traded in a decentralized and transparent way. Recently, cryptocurrencies with large market capitalization (mostly Bitcoin) have been studied theoretically, but a deeper understanding of their underlying mechanisms remains elusive. Here we explore the nonextensivity of price changes for 20 cryptocurrency exchanges from 2013 until 2017. We discover nonextensive triplets in the cryptocurrency market, where the three associated values for Bitcoin are remarkably close to those of the logistic map near the edge of chaos. The current findings strongly indicate that the cryptocurrency market represents a system whose physics is properly described by nonextensive statistical mechanics. Our results shed light on the complex and volatile nature of cryptocurrencies, and establish the first formal link with the nonextensive theory. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain technology for providing an architecture model of
   decentralized personal health information
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING BUSINESS MANAGEMENT
AB The personal health information (PHI) is an activity among the health-care providers and the patients in terms of managing the data which is sensitive to the parties. The PHI data have been maintained by multiple health-care providers, thus resulting in separated data. Moreover, the PHI data are stored in the provider's database, hence the patients have no authority to manage their own information. Therefore, in this article, we propose a conceptual model for managing the PHI data which is derived from several health-care providers by relying on the blockchain technology in the peer-to-peer overlay network. In addition, we elaborate the security analysis that might be occurring in the proposed model. By leveraging on our model, it allows the patients and the providers to collect effectively the PHI data onto a single view as well guarantee of data integrity. The blockchain offers an immutable of the data record without having to trust a third party. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising to be developed due to the high success rate in terms of data dissemination.

TI Bitcoin market route to maturity? Evidence from return fluctuations,
   temporal correlations and multiscaling effects
SO CHAOS
AB Based on 1-min price changes recorded since year 2012, the fluctuation properties of the rapidly emerging Bitcoin market are assessed over chosen sub-periods, in terms of return distributions, volatility autocorrelation, Hurst exponents, and multiscaling effects. The findings are compared to the stylized facts of mature world markets. While early trading was affected by system-specific irregularities, it is found that over the months preceding April 2018 all these statistical indicators approach the features hallmarking maturity. This can be taken as an indication that the Bitcoin market, and possibly other cryptocurrencies, carry concrete potential of imminently becoming a regular market, alternative to the foreign exchange. Since high-frequency price data are available since the beginning of trading, the Bitcoin offers a unique window into the statistical characteristics of a market maturation trajectory.

TI Recent Patient Health Monitoring Platforms Incorporating Internet of
   Things-Enabled Smart Devices
SO INTERNATIONAL NEUROUROLOGY JOURNAL
AB Synergistic integration of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and big data technologies in healthcare have led to the notion of "smart health." Smart health is an emerging concept that refers to the provision of healthcare services for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up management at any time or any place by connecting information technologies and healthcare. As a significant breakthrough in smart healthcare development, IoT-enabled smart devices allow medical centers to carry out preventive care, diagnosis, and treatment more competently. This review focuses on recently developed patient health monitoring platforms based on IoT-enabled smart devices that can collect real-time patient data and transfer information for assessment by healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals, and clinics, or for self-management. We aimed to summarize the available information about recently approved devices and state-of-the-art developments through a comprehensive, systematic literature review. In this review, we also discuss possible future directions for the integration of cloud computing and blockchain, which may offer unprecedented breakthroughs in on-demand medical services. The combination of IoT with real-time, remote patient monitoring empowers patients to assert more control over their care, thereby allowing them to actively monitor their particular health conditions.

TI Describing adaptation tipping points in coastal flood risk management
SO COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
AB Assessing changing coastal flood risk becomes increasingly uncertain across multi-decadal timeframes. This uncertainty is a fundamental complexity faced in vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning. Robust decision making (RDM) and dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) are two state-of-the-art decision support methods that are useful in such situations. In this study we use RDM to identify a small set of conditions that cause unacceptable impacts from coastal flooding, signifying that an adaptation tipping point is reached. Flexible adaptation pathways can then be designed using the DAPP framework. The methodology is illustrated using a case study in Australia and underpinned by a geographic information system model. The results suggest that conditions identified in scenario discovery direct the attention of decision-makers towards a small number of uncertainties most influential on the vulnerability of a community to changing flood patterns. This can facilitate targeted data collection and coastal monitoring activities when resources are scarce. Importantly, it can also be employed to illustrate more broadly how uncontrolled societal development, land use and historic building regulations might exacerbate flood impacts in low-lying urban areas. Notwithstanding the challenges that remain around simulation modelling and detection of environmental change, the results from our study suggest that RDM can be embedded within a DAPP framework to better plan for changing coastal flood risks.

TI CoC: A Unified Distributed Ledger Based Supply Chain Management System
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Modern supply chain is a complex system and plays an important role for different sectors under the globalization economic integration background. Supply chain management system is proposed to handle the increasing complexity and improve the efficiency of flows of goods. It is also useful to prevent potential frauds and guarantee trade compliance. Currently, most companies maintain their own IT systems for supply chain management. However, it is hard for these isolated systems to work together and provide a global view of the status of the highly distributed supply chain system. Using emerging decentralized ledger/blockchain technology, which is a special type of distributed system in essence, to build supply chain management system is a promising direction to go. Decentralized ledger usually suffers from low performance and lack of capability to protect information stored on the ledger. To overcome these challenges, we propose CoC (supply chain on blockchain), a novel supply chain management system based on a hybrid decentralized ledger with a novel two-step block construction mechanism. We also design an efficient storage scheme and information protection method that satisfy requirements of supply chain management. These techniques can also be applied to other decentralized ledger based applications with requirements similar to supply chain management.

The incentive system motivates independent, self-interested transporters for helping the devices to be updated. To ensure the system correctly operates, we employ the blockchain system that enforces the commitment in a decentralized manner.

SO HANDBOOK OF SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
SE World Sustainability Series
AB Blockchain technology (aka Distributed Ledger Technology or DLT) is a novel configuration of Peer-to-Peer, cryptographic and distributed computing technologies that have the potential to shift the internet from an internet of information to an internet of value network, with significant disruptive potential. To date, the cryptocurrency 'bitcoin' is the application of DLT that has attracted most attention, not all of it favourable. However, DLTs are about much more than cryptocurrencies and, as Kranzberg's (1986) first law of technology, that 'Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral' reminds us, we can ethically frame applications of new technologies. To date, research has tended to focus on the technical characteristics of DLTs, and there has been little reflection on potential socially and environmentally beneficial use cases: Blockchain for Good (B4G). The aim of this this exploratory and descriptive paper is to reflect on innovative B4G applications that could help deliver socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, framed in terms of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, through challenging existing business models and providing new opportunities for value creation.

TI A Low Storage Room Requirement Framework for Distributed Ledger in
   Blockchain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Traditional centralized commerce on the Internet relies on trusted third parties to process electronic payments. It suffers from the weakness of the trust-based model. A pure decentralized mechanism called blockchain tackles the above problem and has become a hot research area. However, since each node in a blockchain system needs to store all transactions of the other nodes, as time continues, the storage room required to store the entire blockchain will be huge. Therefore, the current storage mechanism needs to be revised to cater to the rapidly increasing need for storage. Network coded (NC) distributed storage (DS) can significantly reduce the required storage room. This paper proposes a NC-DS framework to store the blockchain and proposes corresponding solutions to apply the NC-DS to the blockchain systems. Analysis shows that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvement in saving storage room.

TI Personality Pathology and Relationship Satisfaction in Dating and
   Married Couples
SO PERSONALITY DISORDERS-THEORY RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
AB Personality disorders (PDs) are inherently associated with deficits in relating to other people. Previous research has shown consistent negative associations between categorical PD symptoms and relationship satisfaction. The present studies extend on these findings by examining the role of maladaptive traits in a number of ways. Self- and partner-reported maladaptive traits of both partners are included. Moreover, the present studies add a couple-centered approach by investigating the effects of actual similarity, perceptual similarity, and perceptual accuracy of the maladaptive trait profile on relationship satisfaction. PDs are conceptualized using 2 dimensional maladaptive trait models, that is, the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Basic Questionnaire in Study 1 and the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 in Study 2. A total of 167 heterosexual couples participated in Study 1 and 52 heterosexual couples in Study 2. The actor-partner interdependence model was used to examine the associations between traits and relationship satisfaction, whereas the coefficient of profile agreement was used for the couple-centered analyses. Overall, results showed that the presence of maladaptive traits within romantic relationships has a detrimental effect on relationship satisfaction. Self-ratings on maladaptive traits, how we perceive our partners, and how we are perceived by our partners on maladaptive traits make significant contributions to our relationship (dis)satisfaction. Among the maladaptive traits, negative affect and detachment were most consistently negatively associated with relationship satisfaction. The couple-centered perspective showed less explanatory value but nontrivial associations between perceptual similarity and relationship satisfaction were found in Study 2.

AB The recent growth of the blockchain technology market puts its main cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. Among them, Ethereum stands out due to its virtual machine (EVM) supporting smart contracts, i.e., distributed programs that control the flow of the digital currency Ether. Being written in a Turing complete language, Ethereum smart contracts allow for expressing a broad spectrum of financial applications. The price for this expressiveness, however, is a significant semantic complexity, which increases the risk of programming errors. Recent attacks exploiting bugs in smart contract implementations call for the design of formal verification techniques for smart contracts. This, however, requires rigorous semantic foundations, a formal characterization of the expected security properties, and dedicated abstraction techniques tailored to the specific EVM semantics. This work will overview the state-of-the-art in smart contract verification, covering formal semantics, security definitions, and verification tools. We will then focus on EtherTrust [1], a framework for the static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts which includes the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, the first formal characterization of a large class of security properties for smart contracts, and the first static analysis for EVM bytecode that comes with a proof of soundness.

AB A developing field of interest for the distributed systems and applied cryptography communities is that of smart contracts: self-executing financial instruments that synchronize their state, often through a blockchain. One such smart contract system that has seen widespread practical adoption is Ethereum, which has grown to a market capacity of 100 billion USD and clears an excess of 500,000 daily transactions.
   Unfortunately, the rise of these technologies has been marred by a series of costly bugs and exploits. Increasingly, the Ethereum community has turned to formal methods and rigorous program analysis tools. This trend holds great promise due to the relative simplicity of smart contracts and bounded-time deterministic execution inherent to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
   Here we present KEVM, an executable formal specification of the EVM's bytecode stack-based language built with the K Framework, designed to serve as a solid foundation for further formal analyses. We empirically evaluate the correctness and performance of KEVM using the official Ethereum test. suite In To demonstrate the usability, several extensions of the semantics are presented and two different-language implementations of the ERC20 Standard Token are verified against the ERC20 specification. These results are encouraging 14 the executable semantics approach to language prototyping and specification.

In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchain-based application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election.

AB As the Internet of Things (IoT) develops and expands, management of IoT communications becomes a major challenge. A large number of IoT devices may be installed anywhere end users wish, then left unattended and be misused to attack others. In edge networks, it is difficult to properly prevent undesired communication without knowledge of the properties of an IoT service and its devices. In this paper, we argue that application service providers, developers, and network operators should 1) verify and know the authenticity of IoT services, devices, and their communications, and 2) prevent unwanted traffic from IoT devices in a trustworthy, scalable, and distributed manner. This paper proposes a Trust List that represents the distribution of trust among IoT-related stakeholders and provides autonomous enforcement of IoT traffic management at the edge networks by integrating blockchains and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). The principle of Trust List is automating the process of doubting, verifying, and trusting IoT services and devices to effectively prevent attacks and abuses. The proof of concept implementation and experiment of the Trust List using both public and private blockchains reveal its good practice and suggest studies for realistic deployment.

AB Termination of smart contracts is crucial for any blockchain system's security and consistency, especially for those supporting Turing-complete smart contract languages. Resource-constrained blockchain systems, like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, could prevent smart contracts from terminating properly when the pre-allocated resources are not sufficient. The Zen system utilizes the dependent type system of the programming language F* to prove the termination of smart contracts for all inputs during compilation time. Since the smart contract execution usually depends on the current blockchain state and user inputs, this approach is not always successful. In this work, we propose a lazy approach by statically proving conditional termination and non-termination of a smart contract to determine input conditions under which the contract terminates or not. Prior to the execution of the smart contract, the proof-carrying blockchain system will check that its current state and the contract's input satisfy the termination conditions in order to determine if the contract is qualified (i.e., eventually terminating) to run on the chain.

AB Smart contracts enabled a new way to perform cryptocurrency transactions over blockchains. While this emerging technique introduces free-of-conflicts and transparency, smart contract itself is vulnerable. As a special form of computer program, smart contract can hardly get rid of bugs. Even worse, an exploitable security bug can lead to catastrophic consequences, e.g., loss of cryptocurrency/money. In this demo paper, we focus on the most common type of security bugs in smart contracts, i.e., reentrancy bug, which caused the famous DAO attack with a loss of 60 million US dollars. We presented ReGuard, an fuzzing-based analyzer to automatically detect reentrancy bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. Specifically, ReGuard performs fuzz testing on smart contracts by iteratively generating random but diverse transactions. Based on the runtime traces, ReGuard further dynamically identifies reentrancy vulnerabilities. In the preliminary evaluation, we have analyzed 5 existing Ethereum contracts. ReGuard automatically flagged 7 previously unreported reentrancy bugs. A demo video of ReGuard is at https://youtu.be/XxJ3_-cmUiY.

TI Unlinkable Coin Mixing Scheme for Transaction Privacy Enhancement of
   Bitcoin
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bitcoin combines a peer-to-peer network and cryptographic algorithm to implement a distributed digital currency system, which keeps all transaction history on a public blockchain. Since all transactions recorded on the blockchain are public to everyone, Bitcoin users face a threat of leaking financial privacy. Many analysis and deanonymization approaches have been proposed to link transaction records to real identities. To eliminate this threat, we present an unlinkable coin mixing scheme that allows users to mix their bitcoins without trusting a third party. This mixing scheme employs a primitive known as ring signature with elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) to conceal the transfer of coins between addresses. The mixing server is only able to check whether the output addresses belong to its customers, but it cannot tell which address owned by which customer. Customers do not have to rely on the reputation of a third party to ensure his money will be returned, and his privacy will not be leaked. This scheme needs no modifications on current Bitcoin system and is convenient to deploy by any communities. We implemented a prototype of our scheme and tested it under the Bitcoin core's regtest mode. Security and privacy of our mixing scheme are ensured through the standard ring signature and ECDSA unforgeability.

TI Blockchain-Based Mobile Edge Computing Framework for Secure Therapy
   Applications
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Mobile edge computing (MEC) is being introduced and leveraged in many domains, but few studies have addressed MEC for secure in-home therapy management. To this end, this paper presents an in-home therapy management framework, which leverages the IoT nodes and the blockchain-based decentralized MEC paradigm to support low-latency, secure, anonymous, and always-available spatiotemporal multimedia therapeutic data communication within an on-demand data-sharing scenario. To the best of our knowledge, this non-invasive, MEC-based IoT therapy platform is first done by our group. This platform can provide a full-body joint range of motion data for physically challenged individuals in a decentralized manner. With MEC, the framework can provide therapy diagnostic and analytical data on demand to a large portion of humanity who are either born with disabilities or became disabled due to accidents, war-time injuries, or old age. For security, the framework uses blockchain-Tor-based distributed transactions to preserve the therapeutic data privacy, ownership, generation, storage, and sharing. Our initial test results from a complete implementation of the framework show that it can support a sufficiently large number of users without considerable increase in mean processing time.

AB Wireless network virtualization is regarded as an emerging paradigm to enhance RF spectrum utilization to support exponentially increasing demand caused by emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. To create virtual wireless networks (VWNs), there are no automated secure approaches for allocating RF spectrum to meet the dynamically changing quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. In wireless networks, RF spectrum is shared among many users and the given RF spectrum could be easily overcrowded because of the over commitment of limited resources by the service providers. There is a direct incentive in terms of revenue to service providers to have more number of users. In this paper, we propose to leverage a distributed Blockchain - also known as a public ledger - based scheme to create VWNs where primary wireless resource-owners (PWROs) sublease their wireless resources (e.g., slice of RF spectrum, infrastructure) to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) using machine-to-machine communication based on the service level agreements (SLAs) between PWROs and MVNOs. The proposed distributed Blockchain-based scheme provides security to participating PWROs and MVNOs as well as prevents PWROs from over committing their resources (that stops double spending) and helps MVNOs to meet the QoS requirements of their users. The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or similar regulatory bodies in other countries participate in this framework by providing the guidelines and regulations about maximum power levels, licensing and geographic coverages, etc. This essentially helps users to meet their desired QoS requirements while complying the government regulations. Performance is evaluated using numerical results.

AB In this paper, we design, develop, and evaluate a novel information sharing (iShare) framework for cybersecurity with the goal of protecting confidential information and networked infrastructures from future cyber-attacks. The proposed iShare framework leverages the Blockchain concept used in Bitcoin systems where multiple organizations/agencies participate for information sharing (without violating their privacy) to secure and monitor their cyberspace. Note that the Bitcoin for financial transactions has already demonstrated that there is a trusted, auditable sharing with peer-to-peer communications accompanied by a public ledger. The main aim of the Blockchain-based iShare framework is to constantly collect high-resolution, cyber-attack information across organizational boundaries of which the organizations have no specific knowledge or control over any other organizations' data or damage caused by cyber-attacks. In the proposed iShare framework, the decentralized nature of the Blockchain and digitally signed transactions ensure that an adversary cannot pose as a legitimate organization/user or cannot control/hamper the system because of the digital-signatures and cannot learn anything from the public ledger that has just hashed pointers. Moreover, we analyze the security attacks by outsiders (not participating in the iShare) using a Stackelberg game.

AB The blockchain systems are analyzed under the context of the personal health record system (PHRs) requirements. The transparent property of blockchain may cause the privacy and confidentiality concerns for PHRs. The append-only storage of blockchain can be a barrier for implementing the revocability of consent in PHRs. Moreover, the health care data can be very large exceeding the practical storage capabilities of the current blockchain usages. The most important issues of blockchain include the limited storage, privacy, consent revocation, performance, energy consumption and scalability. A blockchain based secret-data sharing model is proposed by using a proxy re-encryption technique to support the PHRs in this work. Some potential attacks which can attempt on the proposed model and how the model can handle such attempts is also discussed.

AB This paper examines the movement of cryptocurrencies' return based on price. This volatility can spread to others of the same kind. Currently, the more cryptocurrencies are traded in market, the more chances are available for investors. The author wonders whether contagion risk among these cryptocurrencies happens or not in the event of crashing. We also introduce one empirical evidence of the mutual influence on these cryptocurrencies using Copulas approach. The findings show that all pairs have the structure dependence with Kendall-plots, particularly strong left tail dependence with Chi-plots. It also means the existence of contagion risk among these cryptocurrencies. The three methodologies namely Kendall-plots, Chi-plots and Copulas estimation produce consistent results. Therefore, the investors should carefully perform portfolio diversification to avoid contagious phenomenon.

TI Towards Secure Network Computing Services for Lightweight Clients Using
   Blockchain
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB The emerging network computing technologies have significantly extended the abilities of the resource-constrained loT devices through the network-based service sharing techniques. However, such a flexible and scalable service provisioning paradigm brings increased security risks to terminals due to the untrustworthy exogenous service codes loading from the open network. Many existing security approaches are unsuitable for IoT environments due to the high difficulty of maintenance or the dependencies upon extra resources like specific hardware. Fortunately, the rise of blockchain technology has facilitated the development of service sharing methods and, at the same time, it appears a viable solution to numerous security problems. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based secure service provisioning mechanism for protecting lightweight clients from insecure services in network computing scenarios. We introduce the blockchain to maintain all the validity states of the off-chain services and edge service providers for the IoT terminals to help them get rid of untrusted or discarded services through provider identification and service verification. In addition, we take advantage of smart contracts which can be triggered by the lightweight clients to help them check the validities of service providers and service codes according to the on-chain transactions, thereby reducing the direct overhead on the IoT devices. Moreover, the adoptions of the consortium blockchain and the proof of authority consensus mechanism also help to achieve a high throughput. The theoretical security analysis and evaluation results show that our approach helps the lightweight clients get rid of untrusted edge service providers and insecure services effectively with acceptable latency and affordable costs.

AB The Blockchain (BC) technology has received religious attention in the financial and internet domains, and recently interest has spread to adjacent sectors like communications. This paper seeks to identify the impact of the BC technology in novel spectrum sharing concepts using the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) concept as an example. The results indicate that the BC core characteristics can be utilized in several use cases addressing current CBRS implementation considerations. The CBRS concept could particularly benefit of BCs in building trust, consensus and lowering the transaction cost. In BC deployments, confidentiality should be taken into consideration through hybrid and private BC options. Furthermore, the cognitive radio spectrum sharing - BC combination paves the way for new business models and distributed services.

TI Scalable Zero Knowledge Via Cycles of Elliptic Curves
SO ALGORITHMICA
AB Non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for general NP statements are a powerful cryptographic primitive, both in theory and in practical applications. Recently, much research has focused on achieving an additional property, succinctness, requiring the proof to be very short and easy to verify. Such proof systems are known as zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs), and are desired when communication is expensive, or the verifier is computationally weak. Existing zk-SNARK implementations have severe scalability limitations, in terms of space complexity as a function of the size of the computation being proved (e.g., running time of the NP statement's decision program). First, the size of the proving key is quasilinear in the upper bound on the computation size. Second, producing a proof requires "writing down" all intermediate values of the entire computation, and then conducting global operations such as FFTs. The bootstrapping technique of Bitansky et al. (STOC ' 13), following Valiant (TCC ' 08), offers an approach to scalability, by recursively composing proofs: proving statements about acceptance of the proof system's own verifier (and correctness of the program's latest step). Alas, recursive composition of known zk-SNARKs has never been realized in practice, due to enormous computational cost. Using new elliptic-curve cryptographic techniques, and methods for exploiting the proof systems' field structure and nondeterminism, we achieve the first zk-SNARK implementation that practically achieves recursive proof composition. Our zk-SNARK implementation runs random-access machine programs and produces proofs of their correct execution, on today's hardware, for any program running time. It takes constant time to generate the keys that support all computation sizes. Subsequently, the proving process only incurs a constant multiplicative overhead compared to the original computation's time, and an essentially-constant additive overhead in memory. Thus, our zk-SNARK implementation is the first to have a well-defined, albeit low, clock rate of "verified instructions per second".

TI On the Philosophy of Bitcoin/Blockchain Technology: Is it a Chaotic,
   Complex System?
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB The philosophy of blockchain technology is concerned, among other things, with blockchain ontology, how it might be characterised, how it is being created, implemented, and adopted, how it operates in the world, and how it evolves over time. This paper concentrates on whether Bitcoin/blockchain can be considered a complex system and, if so, whether it is a chaotic one. Beyond mere academic curiosity, a positive response would raise concerns about the likelihood of Bitcoin/blockchain entering a 2010-Flash-Crash-type of chaotic regime, with catastrophic consequences for financial systems based on it. The paper starts by highlighting the relevant details of the Bitcoin/blockchain ecosystem formed by the blockchain itself, bitcoin end users (payers and payees), capital gains seekers, miners, full nodes maintainers, and developers, and their interactions. Then the Information Theory of Complex Systems is briefly discussed for later use. Finally, the blockchain is investigated with the help of Crutchfield's Statistical Complexity measure. The low non-null statistical complexity value obtained suggests that the blockchain may be considered algorithmically complicated but hardly a complex system and unlikely to enter a chaotic regime.

TI Blockchain Identities: Notational Technologies for Control and
   Management of Abstracted Entities
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB This paper argues that many so-called digital technologies can be construed as notational technologies, explored through the example of Monegraph, an art and digital asset management platform built on top of the blockchain system originally developed for the cryptocurrency bitcoin. As the paper characterizes it, a notational technology is the performance of syntactic notation within a field of reference, a technologized version of what Nelson Goodman called a notational system. Notational technologies produce abstracted entities through positive and reliable, or constitutive, tests of socially acceptable meaning. Accordingly, this account deviates from typical narratives of blockchains (usually characterized as Turing or state machines), instead demonstrating that blockchain technologies are effective at managing digital assets because they produce abstracted identities through the performance of notation. Since notational technologies rely on configurations of socially acceptable meaning, this paper also provides a philosophical account of how blockchain technologies are socially embedded.

TI Behavior pattern clustering in blockchain networks
SO MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain holds promise for being the revolutionary technology, which has the potential to find applications in numerous fields such as digital money, clearing, gambling and product tracing. However, blockchain faces its own problems and challenges. One key problem is to automatically cluster the behavior patterns of all the blockchain nodes into categories. In this paper, we introduce the problem of behavior pattern clustering in blockchain networks and propose a novel algorithm termed BPC for this problem. We evaluate a long list of potential sequence similarity measures, and select a distance that is suitable for the behavior pattern clustering problem. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm is much more effective than the existing methods in terms of clustering accuracy.

TI Blockchain Technology as an Institution of Property
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB This paper argues that the practical implementation of blockchain technology can be considered an institution of property similar to legal institutions. Invoking Penner's theory of property and Hegel's system of property rights, and using the example of bitcoin, it is possible to demonstrate that blockchain effectively implements all necessary and sufficient criteria for property without reliance on legal means. Blockchains eliminate the need for a third-party authority to enforce exclusion rights, and provide a system of universal access to knowledge and discoverability about the property rights of all participants and how the system functions. The implications of these findings are that traditional property relations in society could be replaced by or supplemented with blockchain models, and implemented in new domains.

AB Blockchain technology, which supports low-cost decentralized distributed data management featuring tamper resistance, high availability, and transparency, is a breakthrough technology that will lead to the next generation of information and communications technology (ICT). Originally devised to support the Bitcoin digital currency, it is expected to be applied to a broad range of financial applications as well as in various other sectors such as distribution and sharing economies. This broader application requires that several technical challenges including data privacy protection and better processing performance be addressed, and Fujitsu Laboratories is working on several relevant R&D projects. This paper introduces blockchain technology and example applications, describes a technology for achieving security in a business context, and examines Fujitsu's efforts in commercializing this technology and an accompanying service as well as the open source software (0SS) project.

TI A Novel Multi-link Integrated Factor Algorithm Considering Node Trust
   Degree for Blockchain-based Communication
SO KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB A blockchain is an underlying technology and basic infrastructure of the Bitcoin system. At present, blockchains and their applications are developing rapidly. However, the basic research of blockchain technology is still in the early stages. The efficiency and reliability of blockchain communication is one of the research problems that urgently need to be studied and addressed. Existing algorithms may be less feasible for blockchain-based communication because they only consider a single communication factor (node communication capability or node trust degree) and only focus on a single communication performance parameter(communication time or communication reliability). In this paper, to shorten the validation time of blockchain transactions and improve the reliability of blockchain-based communication, we first establish a multi-link concurrent communication model based on trust degree, and then we propose a novel integrated factor communication tree algorithm (IFT). This algorithm comprehensively considers the node communication link number and the node trust degree and selects several nodes with powerful communication capacity and high trust as the communication sources to improve the concurrency and communication efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the IFT algorithm outperforms existing algorithms. A blockchain communication routing scheme based on the IFT algorithm can increase communication efficiency by ensuring communication reliability.

To do so, we explain how to employ an ECDSA adaption of the two-party signature protocol by MacKenzie and Reiter (Int J Inf Secur 2(3-4):218-239, 2004. doi:10.1007/s10207-004-0041-0 Address="10.1007/s10207-004-0041-0") in the context of Bitcoin and present a prototypic implementation of a Bitcoin wallet that offers both: two-factor authentication and verification over a separate channel. Since we use a smart phone as the second authentication factor, our solution can be used with hardware already available to most users and the user experience is quite similar to the existing online banking authentication methods.

The aim is to provide users a mechanism to quickly identify interesting nodes for further analysis. Fuzzy logic allows a flexible framework to ask human-like curiosity-driven questions over the data, and visualisation allows its communication and understanding. Together, these two technologies successfully empower novices and experts to a faster and deeper understanding of the underlying patterns in big datasets compared to traditional means in a desktop screen with crisp queries.

AB We design and implement a simple zero-knowledge argument protocol for NP whose communication complexity is proportional to the square-root of the verification circuit size. The protocol can be based on any collision-resistant hash function. Alternatively, it can be made non-interactive in the random oracle model, yielding concretely efficient zk-SNARKs that do not require a trusted setup or public-key cryptography.
   Our protocol is attractive not only for very large verification circuits but also for moderately large circuits that arise in applications. For instance, for verifying a SHA-256 preimage in zero knowledge with 2(-40) soundness error, the communication complexity is roughly 44KB (or less than 34KB under a plausible conjecture), the prover running time is 140 ms, and the verifier running time is 62 ms. This proof is roughly 4 times shorter than a similar proof of ZKB++ (Chase et al., CCS 2017), an optimized variant of ZKBoo (Giacomelli et al., USENIX 2016).
   The communication complexity of our protocol is independent of the circuit structure and depends only on the number of gates. For 2-40 soundness error, the communication becomes smaller than the circuit size for circuits containing roughly 3 million gates or more. Our efficiency advantages become even bigger in an amortized setting, where several instances need to be proven simultaneously.
   Our zero-knowledge protocol is obtained by applying an optimized version of the general transformation of Ishai et al. (STOC 2007) to a variant of the protocol for secure multiparty computation of Damgard and Ishai (Crypto 2006). It can be viewed as a simple zero-knowledge interactive PCP based on "interleaved" Reed-Solomon codes.

AB Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that uses a ledger (or "blockchain") to keep track of the transactions made between its users. Because it is a fully decentralized system and anyone can join, every transaction is by necessity public. Thus, to preserve some semblance of privacy, users in the system are represented not by their real-world identities but by pseudonyms. While pseudonyms are acceptable for a standalone cryptocurrency, the emergence of other potential blockchain-based applications - e.g., using them to administer benefits and pensions - poses a need to associate certain attributes with the users of the system. In this paper, we address the question of how to register identities and attributes in a system built on globally visible ledgers. We propose a variety of possible solutions and in each case, we analyze the tradeoff our solution provides between privacy (ensuring that no one can associate the user's real-world identity with the pseudonym or other attributes they use on the ledger), usability (ensuring that verification of their attributes poses the lowest possible burden to users), and integrity (ensuring that no one can impersonate a user). We also present an implementation of one of our solution using Ethereum.

AB We present functions that can be computed in some fixed polynomial time but are hard on average for any algorithm that runs in slightly smaller time, assuming widely-conjectured worst-case hardness for problems from the study of fine-grained complexity. Unconditional constructions of such functions are known from before (Goldmann et al., IPL '94), but these have been canonical functions that have not found further use, while our functions are closely related to well-studied problems and have considerable algebraic structure.
   Based on the average-case hardness and structural properties of our functions, we outline the construction of a Proof of Work scheme and discuss possible approaches to constructing fine-grained One-Way Functions. We also show how our reductions make conjectures regarding the worst-case hardness of the problems we reduce from (and consequently the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis) heuristically falsi fiable in a sense similar to that of (Naor, CRYPTO '03).
   We prove our hardness results in each case by showing fine grained reductions from solving one of three problems - namely, Orthogonal Vectors (OV), 3SUM, and All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) in the worst case to computing our function correctly on a uniformly random input. The conjectured hardness of OV and 3SUM then gives us functions that require n(-0(1)) time to compute on average, and that of APSP gives us a function that requires n(3-0)(1) time. Using the same techniques we also obtain a conditional average-case time hierarchy of functions.

AB Blockchain technology allows the implementation of a public ledger securely recording transactions among peers without the need of trusted third parties. For both researchers and industry, IoT appears a domain in which there would be extraordinary benefits if the features of Blockchain can be exploited. Indeed, the possibility that IoT devices participate in public shared transactions enables a lot of challenging applications. However, there are some aspects that may limit the use of Blockchain in IoT. These are mainly related to the low computational power and storage capabilities of IoT devices. In this paper, we propose an alternative way to implement a public ledger overcoming the above drawbacks, thus appearing more suitable to IoT applications. The proposed protocol leverages the popular social network Twitter and works by building a meshed chain of tweets to ensure transaction security. Importantly, Twitter does not play neither the role of trusted third party nor the role of ledger provider.

AB IPFS [1] is a peer-to-peer version controlled filesystem that synthesizes learnings from many previous successful systems. IPFS combines a distributed Hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace [1]. IPFS is a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the web faster, safer, and more open. According to the characteristics of IPFS, we propose an improved P2P file system scheme based on IPFS and Blockchain. We address the high-throughput problem for individual users in IPFS by introducing the role of content service providers. Consider data reliability and availability, storage overhead and other issues for service providers, we provide a novel zigzag-based storage model to improve the block storage model that IPFS provides. Moreover, we introduce blockchain to combine IPFS with this storage model. According to analysis, this proposed scheme can effectively solve the above problems.

TI Sensitive detection of trimethylamine based on dopant-assisted positive
   photoionization ion mobility spectrometry
SO TALANTA
AB Biogenic amines are degradation products generated through enzymatic and microbial processes during food spoilage, which may pose a health hazard to consumers at elevated levels. Trimethylamine (TMA) is a good target for the detection of biogenic amines due to its volatility and fishy odor. In this study, we developed a stand-alone dopant-assisted positive photoionization ion mobility spectrometry (DAPP-IMS) for rapid and sensitive detection of TMA. Response of TMA was enhanced by the addition of dopants and characteristic product ions with reduced mobility 2.26 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) were formed. 2-Butaone was chosen as the dopant for better separation between reagent ion peak and TMA product ion peak as well as higher sensitivity and the limit of detections (LODs) for TMA standard sample was 1 ppb. The potential application of DAAP-IMS was evaluated by the detection of TMA generated by oyster and shrimp during 4 degrees C storage. Analysis of two kinds of seafood showed the same characteristic peak to TMA standard sample, and the intensity of TMA increased over the storage time. The results of this study testify to the potential of DAPP-IMS for qualitative and quantitative determination of TMA in real food samples.

AB Blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, promise to facilitate transactions on a decentralized computing platform among parties that have not established trust. Recognition of the unique challenges of blockchain programming has inspired developers to create domain-specific languages, such as Solidity, for programming blockchain systems. Unfortunately, bugs in Solidity programs have recently been exploited to steal money. We propose a new programming language, Obsidian, to make it easier for programmers to write correct programs.

AB Bitcoin is digital assets infrastructure powering the first worldwide decentralized cryptocurrency of the same name. All history of Bitcoins owning and transferring (addresses and transactions) is available as a public ledger called blockchain. But real-world owners of addresses are not known in general. That's why Bitcoin is called pseudo-anonymous. However, some addresses can be grouped by their ownership using behavior patterns and publicly available information from off-chain sources.
   Blockchain-based common behavior pattern analysis (common spending and one-time change heuristics) is widely used for Bitcoin clustering as votes for addresses association, while off-chain information (tags) is mostly used to verify results. In this paper, we propose to use off-chain information as votes for address separation and to consider it together with blockchain information during the clustering model construction step. Both blockchain and off-chain information are not reliable, and our approach aims to filter out errors in input data.
   The results of the study show the feasibility of a proposed approached for Bitcoin address clustering. It can be useful for the users to avoid insecure Bitcoin usage patterns and for the investigators to conduct a more advanced de-anonymizing analysis.

AB We propose a new secure online storage scheme based on an open P2P network without a central server. In the proposed scheme, attackers cannot detect target user data in the online storage because the user data is divided into some parts by the secret sharing, and they are distributed to P2P nodes via the anonymous communication. The proposed scheme can prevent the direct attack on the target user node because metadata for the reconstruction also hidden in the online storage, hence nothing remains in the user node. Even if the state of the P2P network varies over time between the storing and restoring operation, the proposed scheme ensures that the user can identify the target nodes which stored his metadata by utilizing the Blockchain technology with only memorable secure information for user authentication. Furthermore, a malicious node to attack on others can be detected and ruled out by the mutual monitoring among the nodes and the majority decision rule.

AB IoT (Internet of Things) has a large portion of our life. This is manifested by the large number of connected devices. With the exponential growth of IoT devices, IoT security is becoming important. In particular, Smart Door Lock system is extremely important because it is closely related to the safety of the user. However, the data sent and received of existing Smart Door Lock system is vulnerable to forgery and hacking. To improve these security issues, we propose a Smart Door Lock system based on blockchain. Also, this provides data integrity and non-repudiation. Lastly, we propose an algorithm that the Smart Door Lock system judge some situations around itself and operates based on data sent from sensors.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in the development of various fields. The increasing scale and scope of applications make a great demand of IoT data exchange in recent years. Meanwhile, a number of IoT data exchange platforms which dedicated to connecting various and distributed data sources are emerging. In such a platform, service providers can search and exchange the data sets that they need. However, the centralized infrastructure cannot provide enough trust as the third-party intermediaries for data exchange. As a result, most platforms unable to satisfy the complex requirements due to few institutions and individuals are willing to share their IoT data sets in such an untrustworthy environment. This paper proposes a decentralized solution based on the blockchain for IoT data trusted exchange. Specifically, In this paper, the basic principles of blockchain and corresponding key technologies are expounded through in-depth analysis of three main reliable requirements in IoT data exchange. Besides, this paper provides an architecture of above solution and detailed design of its main trust component. Finally, it realizes a prototype by using Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts and presents its auditable, transparent, decentralized features visually.

AB In this paper, we present ethnographic data that unpacks the everyday work of some of the many infrastructuring agents who contribute to creating, sustaining and growing the Blockchain information infrastructure. We argue that this infrastructuring work takes the form of entrepreneurial actions, which are self-initiated and primarily directed at sustaining or increasing the initiator's stake in the emerging information infrastructure. These entrepreneurial actions wrestle against the affordances of the installed base of the Blockchain infrastructure, and take the shape of engaging or circumventing activities. These activities purposefully aim at either influencing or working around the enablers and constraints afforded by the Blockchain information infrastructure, as its installed base is gaining inertia. This study contributes to our understanding of the purpose of infrastructuring, seen from the perspective of heterogeneous entrepreneurial agents. It supplements existing accounts of the "when" and "how" of infrastructure, with a lens for examining the "why" of infrastructure.

AB Bitcoin is the most famous cryptocurrency currently operating with a total marketcap of almost 7 billion USD. This innovation stands strong on the feature of pseudo anonymity and strives on its innovative de-centralized architecture based on the Blockchain. The Blockchain is a distributed ledger that keeps a public record of all the transactions processed on the bitcoin protocol network in full transparency without revealing the identity of the sender and the receiver. Over the course of 2016, cryptocurrencies have shown some instances of abuse by criminals in their activities due to its interesting nature. Darknet marketplaces are increasing the volume of their businesses in illicit and illegal trades but also cryptocurrencies have been used in cases of extortion, ransom and as part of sophisticated malware modus operandi. We tackle these challenges by developing an analytical capability that allows us to map relationships on the blockchain and filter crime instances in order to investigate the abuse in law enforcement local environment. We propose a practical bitcoin analytical process and an analyzing system that stands alone and manages all data on the blockchain in real-time with tracing and visualizing techniques rendering transactions decipherable and useful for law enforcement investigation and training. Our system adopts combination of analyzing methods that provides statistics of address, graphical transaction relation, discovery of paths and clustering of already known addresses. We evaluated our system in the three criminal cases includes marketplace, ransomware and DDoS extortion. These are practical training in law enforcement, then we determined whether our system could help investigation process and training.

AB Blockchain - the innovation behind Bitcoin - enables people to exchange digital money with complete trust, and seems to be completely transforming the way we think about trust. While blockchain is designed for secured, immutable funds transfer in trustless and decentralized environment, the underlying storage of blockchain is very simple with only limited supports for data access. Moreover, blockchain data are highly compressed before flushing to hard disk, making it harder to have an insight of these valuable data set. In this work, we develop EtherQL, an efficient query layer for Ethereum - the most representative open-source blockchain system. EtherQL provides highly efficient query primitives for analyzing blockchain data, including range queries and top-k queries, which can be integrated with other applications with much flexibility. Moreover, EtherQL is designed to provide different levels of abstraction, which are suitable for data analysts, researchers and application developers.

AB Blockchain may help solve several complex problems related to integrity and trustworthiness of rapid, distributed, complex energy transactions and data exchanges. In a move towards resilience, blockchain commoditizes trust and enables automated smart contracts to support auditable multiparty transactions based on predefined rules between distributed energy providers and customers. Blockchain based smart contracts also help remove the need to interact with third-parties, facilitating the adoption and monetization of distributed energy transactions and exchanges, both energy flows as well as financial transactions. This may help reduce transactive energy costs and increase the security and sustainability of distributed energy resource (DER) integration, helping to remove barriers to a more decentralized and resilient power grid. This paper explores the application of blockchain and smart contracts to improve smart grid cyber resiliency and secure transactive energy applications.

SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Purpose - Blockchain is a distributed ledger, in which the blocks containing transaction details are connected chronologically to form a series of chains, thus raising the possibility of improving the process and innovating business model for the financial institutions. The purpose of this paper is to study the actual cases of Blockchain applied in Korea in 2017, so that a vision of business model innovation of financial institutions can be drawn.
   Design/methodology/approach - The financial institutions in Korea are in the technology verification stage to introduce Blockchain technology. Since there is an insufficient amount of actual measurement data, case study method was adopted. The authors interviewed ICT officers of major banks in Korea. The purpose of the interview was to understand the relationship between Blockchain and business models of financial institutions, and the effects and challenges that Blockchain has on the business model of financial institutions.
   Findings - From the perspective of financial institutions, the emergence of Blockchain does not just have technical significance - emergence of highly efficient database system - but has the possibility that if the business model of existing financial intermediaries disappears or get reduced, the financial services relying on them can disappear altogether, or some of them can be replaced, and financial transaction patterns of consumers can be changed. As a case studies researched for this paper, it was discovered that the distributed characteristic of Blockchain cannot be applied when actually developing financial services.

TI Implementation of blockchain-based energy trading system
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
AB Purpose - The centralized processes of today's power trading systems are complex and pose a risk of price tampering and hacking. The decentralized and unmodifiable nature of the blockchain technology that has recently been highlighted offers the potential to improve this power trading process. The purpose of this study is to implement a system to apply the blockchain technology to the problem of power trading.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors modeled the power trading problem as the interaction between admin, producer and consumer nodes. And a power trading scenario has been created for this model using a blockchain platform called Multichain which is both fast and highly scalable. To verify this scenario, they implemented a trading system using Savoir, a Python-based JsonRPC module.
   Findings - Experimental results show that all processes, such as blockchain creation, node connectivity, asset issuance and exchange transactions have been correctly handled according to the scenario.
   Originality/value - In this study, the authors have proposed and implemented a power trading method that determines price according to the pure market principle and cannot be manipulated or hacked. It is based on the nature of blockchain technology that is decentralized and cannot be tampered.

AB The potential of blockchain technology has received attention in the area of FinTech the combination of finance and technology. Blockchain technology was first introduced as the technology behind the Bitcoin decentralized virtual currency, but there is the expectation that its characteristics of accurate and irreversible data transfer in a decentralized P2P network could make other applications possible. Although a precise definition of blockchain technology has not yet been given, it is important to consider how to classify different blockchain systems in order to better understand their potential and limitations. The goal of this paper is to add to the discussion on blockchain technology by proposing a classification based on two dimensions external to the system: (1) existence of an authority (without an authority and under an authority) and (2) incentive to participate in the blockchain (market-based and non-market-based). The combination of these elements results in four types of blockchains. We define these dimensions and describe the characteristics of the blockchain systems belonging to each classification.

TI A Privacy-Friendly Gaming Framework in Smart Electricity and Water Grids
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Serious games can be used to push consumers of common-pool resources toward socially responsible consumption patterns. However, gamified interactions can result in privacy leaks and potential misuses of player-provided data. In the Smart Grid ecosystem, a smart metering framework providing some basic cryptographic primitives can enable the implementation of serious games in a privacy-friendly manner. This paper presents a smart metering architecture in which the users have access to their own high-frequency data and can use them as the input data to a multi-party secure protocol. Authenticity and correctness of the data are guaranteed by the usage of a public blockchain. The framework enables a gaming platform to administer a set of team game activities aimed at promoting a more sustainable usage of energy and water. We discuss and assess the performance of a protocol based on Shamir secret sharing scheme, which enables the members of the teams to calculate their overall consumption and to compare it with those of other teams without disclosing individual energy usage data. Additionally, the protocol impedes that the game platform learns the meter readings of the players (either individual or aggregated) and their challenge objectives.

AB Trusted hardware systems, such as Intel's new SGX instruction set architecture extension, aim to provide strong confidentiality and integrity assurances for applications. Recent work, however, raises serious concerns about the vulnerability of such systems to side-channel attacks.
   We propose, formalize, and explore a cryptographic primitive called a Sealed-Glass Proof (SGP) that models computation possible in an isolated execution environment with unbounded leakage, and thus in the face of arbitrary side-channels. A SGP specifically models the capabilities of trusted hardware that can attest to correct execution of a piece of code, but whose execution is transparent, meaning that an application's secrets and state are visible to other processes on the same host.
   Despite this strong threat model, we show that SGPs enable a range of practical applications. Our key observation is that SGPs permit safe verifiable computing in zero-knowledge, as data leakage results only in the prover learning her own secrets. Among other applications, we describe the implementation of an end-to-end bug bounty (or zero-day solicitation) platform that couples a SGX-based SGP with a smart contract. Our platform enables a marketplace that achieves fair exchange, protects against unfair bounty withdrawals, and resists denial-of-service attacks by dishonest sellers. We also consider a slight relaxation of the SGP model that permits black-box modules instantiating minimal, side-channel resistant primitives, yielding a still broader range of applications. Our work shows how trusted hardware systems such as SGX can support trustworthy applications even in the presence of side channels.

AB The majority of business activity of our integrated and connected world takes place in networks based on cloud computing infrastructure that cross national, geographic and jurisdictional boundaries. Such an efficient entity interconnection is made possible through an emerging networking paradigm, Software Defined Networking (SDN) that intends to vastly simplify policy enforcement and network reconfiguration in a dynamic manner. However, despite the obvious advantages this novel networking paradigm introduces, its increased attack surface compared to traditional networking deployments proved to be a thorny issue that creates skepticism when safety-critical applications are considered. Especially when SDN is used to support Internet-of-Things (IoT)-related networking elements, additional security concerns rise, due to the elevated vulnerability of such deployments to specific types of attacks and the necessity of inter-cloud communication any IoT application would require. The overall number of connected nodes makes the efficient monitoring of all entities a real challenge, that must be tackled to prevent system degradation and service outage. This position paper provides an overview of common security issues of SDN when linked to IoT clouds, describes the design principals of the recently introduced Blockchain paradigm and advocates the reasons that render Blockchain as a significant security factor for solutions where SDN and IoT are involved.

SE Research in the Sociology of Organizations
AB Bitcoin is difficult to categorize and indeed has been associated with 112 different labels in the British media (e.g., "private money," "commodity") - most of which poorly describe bitcoin. Specifically, our analyses of 674 media articles, focusing on the relationship between labeling and categorization, identify classification inconsistencies at three levels: within clusters of labels, between labels and categories, and between category attributes. These inconsistencies hamper categorization based on attribute similarity, audience goals, and causal models, respectively. We identify four factors that nurture this categorical anarchy and conclude with a call for research on the socioeconomic revolution heralded by blockchain technology.

AB The authenticity of human resource information has become an important factor that affects the cost and efficiency of human resource management. With the rapid development of mobile devices and Internet technology, various human resource risks caused by information asymmetry constantly bring economic loss, and even a fatal blow, to enterprises. Based on Blockchain(BC), this paper aims to combine traditional encryption technology with Internet-distributed technology, to establish a human resource information management model that reduces the risk of authenticity of human resource information. This model aims to solve the lack of discrimination of the authenticity of human resource information, and to provide authentic and effective decision support information to the human resource management of an organization. The operation method, such as Bitcoin, is used to certify the human resource documentations, as well as to bind the information and the documentation. Furthermore, human resource information is recorded in an accounting book based on BC technology; thus, modifying and validating may be difficult in the entire net work. Consensus mechanism, smart contract, accounting, and payment functions of BC can provide the basic support for human resource information management. Moreover, decentralization of the protection mechanism can be achieved to achieve low cost and high efficiency of information transfer, and to ensure a high-performance work system in the human resource management of enterprises.

AB Bitcoin, a peer-to-peer payment system and digital currency, is often involved in illicit activities such as scamming, ransomware attacks, illegal goods trading, and thievery. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin ecosystem has not yet been mapped and as such there is no estimate of the share of illicit activities. This paper provides the first estimation of the portion of cyber-criminal entities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Our dataset consists of 854 observations categorised into 12 classes (out of which 5 are cybercrime-related) and a total of 100,000 uncategorised observations. The dataset was obtained from the data provider who applied three types of clustering of Bitcoin transactions to categorise entities: co-spend, intelligence-based, and behaviour-based. Thirteen supervised learning classifiers were then tested, of which four prevailed with a cross-validation accuracy of 77.38%, 76.47%, 78.46%, 80.76% respectively. From the top four classifiers, Bagging and Gradient Boosting classifiers were selected based on their weighted average and per class precision on the cybercrime-related categories. Both models were used to classify 100,000 uncategorised entities, showing that the share of cybercrime-related is 29.81% according to Bagging, and 10.95% according to Gradient Boosting with number of entities as the metric. With regard to the number of addresses and current coins held by this type of entities, the results are: 5.79% and 10.02% according to Bagging; and 3.16% and 1.45% according to Gradient Boosting.

AB With the development of digital technologies, especially big data analytics, digital innovations are taking root in various industries, including energy sector. Particularly, urban energy system is also experiencing digital transition; such digital transition not only offers new business models commercially, but also brings new research problems scientifically. The new capabilities enabled by these digital technologies are reshaping the generation, transmission, consumption and storage sections in the urban energy system, sequentially the traditional way of how urban energy system is designed and operated should be reexamined. Starting from here, there have been many studies regarding how various digital technologies can be applied all along the urban energy system value chain; these studies range from individuals' energy consumption pattern characterization by using customer behavior data in smart home, to complex data-driven planning of regional scale energy system. More specifically, numerous computational models have been proposed by the scientific community to mimic the dynamics of various components at various levels in the urban energy system. However, the potential benefits of applying these numerical models are somehow underestimated; we believe there are still several gaps from numerical modeling to computational intelligence which need to be bridged. In such a context, in this paper we strive to present a systematic review on the status of urban energy system related digital innovations as well as prospective outlook on the future application of such digital technologies. Through the study of this paper, we hope to identify several key points where digitalization should be prioritized in urban energy system, picture a roadmap towards future digital technology enabled intelligent urban energy system, and finally points out the research gaps that need to be fulfilled over there.

TI Evolving process views
SO INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY
AB Context: Process views support the paradigm of Business Process Outsourcing, in which providers perform business processes on behalf of their clients. A public process view shields secret or irrelevant details from a private, internal business process, thus allowing a provider to reveal only relevant, non confidential parts of its business process to its clients. Providers can change their internal business processes that may result in inconsistencies with the corresponding process views.
   Objective: This paper aims to develop an approach for propagating changes from an internal, private process to its public process view, such that the internal process and its process view remain consistent.
   Method: We develop the approach in a formal way. Definitions of process models and process views are based on BPEL, the standard language for realizing process models using state-of-the-art service oriented technology. We validate the feasibility of the approach by showing how it can be supported by a conceptual system architecture.
   Results: The approach relies on two key results. First, a formal characterization of the set of private changes to an internal process, i.e., changes that do not need to be propagated to the process view. Second, a characterization of the non-private changes that can safely be propagated from an internal process to its process view such that they remain consistent. Other non-private changes result in an internal process and a process view that are not consistent. The approach is supported by a system architecture for process-based business collaboration.
   Conclusion: The approach supports providers in deciding if and how changes to a private, internal process propagate to its public process view such that the process view and the internal process remain consistent. The approach allows clients to monitor a public process view such that they can safely track changes made to a private, internal process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unlike conventional one-way power flow, smart grid system is of intelligent power grid, based on interaction between power supplier and buyer. In this interactive environment, for example, power user that has its own power production facility can re-sell electricity produced in the self-production facility to other users. A control center supplies and re-sells electricity as key operator. However, the supply of electricity comes to halt when the server of the key operator suddenly fails. Although smart grid can be an alternative to prevent blackout in this case, it is useless if power is not smoothly supplied to power grid even in a normal condition except blackout. In this respect, the present study was aimed to propose P2P energy loan service using block chain-based P2P loan process. Therefore, the proposed power grid system is efficient and can secure reliability by verifying the details of each energy transaction in a server. In addition, block chain technology proposed in this study does not require additional installation of infrastructure such as server and instead users can use existing resources in operating power grid system. This study confirmed that the encryption and security elements of the proposed system are safe from man-in-the-middle attack, replay attack, and masquerading attack. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed P2P energy loan design can be applied to smart grid environment.

TI Self-Enforcing Online Dispute Resolution: Lessons from Bitcoin
SO OXFORD JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES
AB The enforcement of outcomes in online dispute resolution (ODR) is a delicate problem. Since disputes arising out of e-commerce transactions are typically low in value, the traditional channels of coercive enforcement are often not a viable option. The article argues that the Bitcoin system can be used as a source of inspiration to devise new models of self-enforcement. The article describes the legal framework of ODR and argues that the goal of self-enforcement can be attained through the use of technology. It then describes the relevant features of the Bitcoin system, underlining its potential as a new forum for the expression of private autonomy. It then investigates the features of Bitcoin adjudication, before arguing that Bitcoin must be regarded as an original and self-contained system of dispute resolution, whose characteristics can be used to theorise new models of self-enforcement. Next, it compares four alternative models of self-enforcement, two of which take Bitcoin adjudication as an example. Finally, it puts forth recommendations for all actors involved in the implementation of self-enforcing ODR mechanisms and argues that different models should be left free to compete.

TI Weaver: A High-Performance, Transactional Graph Database Based on
   Refinable Timestamps
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB Graph databases have become a common infrastructure component. Yet existing systems either operate on offline snapshots, provide weak consistency guarantees, or use expensive concurrency control techniques that limit performance. In this paper, we introduce a new distributed graph database, called Weaver, which enables efficient, transactional graph analyses as well as strictly serializable ACID transactions on dynamic graphs. The key insight that allows Weaver to combine strict serializability with horizontal scalability and high performance is a novel request ordering mechanism called refinable timestamps. This technique couples coarse-grained vector timestamps with a fine-grained timeline oracle to pay the overhead of strong consistency only when needed. Experiments show that Weaver enables a Bitcoin blockchain explorer that is 8x faster than Blockchain. info, and achieves 10 : 9x higher throughput than the Titan graph database on social network workloads and 4x lower latency than GraphLab on offline graph traversal workloads.

TI Reputation and Reward: Two Sides of the Same Bitcoin
SO SENSORS
AB In Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS), the power of the crowd, jointly with the sensing capabilities of the smartphones they wear, provides a new paradigm for data sensing. Scenarios involving user behavior or those that rely on user mobility are examples where standard sensor networks may not be suitable, and MCS provides an interesting solution. However, including human participation in sensing tasks presents numerous and unique research challenges. In this paper, we analyze three of the most important: user participation, data sensing quality and user anonymity. We tackle the three as a whole, since all of them are strongly correlated. As a result, we present PaySense, a general framework that incentivizes user participation and provides a mechanism to validate the quality of collected data based on the users' reputation. All such features are performed in a privacy-preserving way by using the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Rather than a theoretical one, our framework has been implemented, and it is ready to be deployed and complement any existing MCS system.

AB We introduce the novel notion of a Proof of Human-work (PoH) and present the first distributed consensus protocol from hard Artificial Intelligence problems. As the name suggests, a PoH is a proof that a human invested a moderate amount of effort to solve some challenge. A PoH puzzle should be moderately hard for a human to solve. However, a PoH puzzle must be hard for a computer to solve, including the computer that generated the puzzle, without sufficient assistance from a human. By contrast, CAPTCHAs are only difficult for other computers to solve not for the computer that generated the puzzle. We also require that a PoH be publicly verifiable by a computer without any human assistance and without ever interacting with the agent who generated the proof of human-work. We show how to construct PoH puzzles from indistinguishability obfuscation and from CAPTCHAs. We motivate our ideas with two applications: HumanCoin and passwords. We use PoH puzzles to construct HumanCoin, the first cryptocurrency system with human miners. Second, we use proofs of human work to develop a password authentication scheme which provably protects users against offline attacks.

AB CONIKS is a proposed key transparency system which enables a centralized service provider to maintain an auditable yet privacy-preserving directory of users' public keys. In the original CONIKS design, users must monitor that their data is correctly included in every published snapshot of the directory, necessitating either slow updates or trust in an unspecified third-party to audit that the data structure has stayed consistent. We demonstrate that the data structures for CONIKS are very similar to those used in Ethereum, a consensus computation platform with a Turing-complete programming environment. We can take advantage of this to embed the core CONIKS data structures into an Ethereum contract with only minor modifications. Users may then trust the Ethereum network to audit the data structure for consistency and non-equivocation. Users who do not trust (or are unaware of) Ethereum can self-audit the CONIKS data structure as before. We have implemented a prototype contract for our hybrid EthIKS scheme, demonstrating that it adds only modest bandwidth overhead to CONIKS proofs and costs hundredths of pennies per key update in fees at today's rates.

AB The arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptide sequence is known to specifically interact with integrins, which are chief receptors participating at various stages of cancer disease and in bacterial adhesion/invasion processes. In particular, vitronectin receptor (alpha(v)beta(3)) and fibronectin receptor (alpha(5)beta(1)) integrins are involved respectively in tumour cell targeting and bacteria internalization inhibition. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have elicited a lot of interest as a theranostic platform, owing to their unique optoelectronic as well as self-therapeutic properties as bactericides. The goal of this work was the comprehensive physicochemical characterization of a hybrid peptide-metal nanoparticle biointerface fabricated by the immobilisation, through thiol chemistry, of a fluorescent cyclic RGD peptide onto AgNPs of 13 nm diameter. RGD peptide-functionalized AgNPs were investigated by a multi-technique approach, including various spectroscopic (XPS, FTIR and UV-visible), spectrometric (ToF-SIMS) and microscopic (SEM, TEM, AFM) methods as well as dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential measurements. Proof-of-work experiments by confocal microscopy imaging of the cellular uptake by human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells, overexpressing respectively alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(5)beta(1) integrins, demonstrated a receptor-specific activity of the RGD peptide-functionalised AgNPs, which make them very promising as a multifaceted platform in applications with cells and bacteria.

AB Address clustering tries to construct the one-to-many mapping from entities to addresses in the Bitcoin system. Simple heuristics based on the micro-structure of transactions have proved very effective in practice. In this paper we describe the primary reasons behind this effectiveness: address reuse, avoidable merging, super-clusters with high centrality, and the incremental growth of address clusters. We quantify their impact during Bitcoin's first seven years of existence.

AB A Keyless Signing Infrastructure (KSI) provides users with a means to timestamp documents on a per-second basis. The KSI consists of a global infrastructure with several server layers and by using Merkle hash trees, the root hash can be used to verify the integrity and timestamp of a document. Regular publication of root hashes, e.g., once per month, allows a document to be verified without support of the servers, but the previously proposed publication channels have several limitations. In this paper we address these limitations and show how a blockchain can be used as an additional publication layer on top of a KSI. Using the scripting capabilities in transactions, new features are introduced to the publication of root hashes. This includes faster publication, proof of origin for the publisher and the possibility for third parties to explicitly verify root hashes before they are published. These improvements will allow the verification of documents to be simpler, more flexible and more secure.

AB The rampant absorption of Bitcoin as a cryptographic currency, along with rising cybercrime activities, warrants utilization of anomaly detection to identify potential fraud. Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in data mining since most outlying points contain crucial information for further investigation. In the financial world which the Bitcoin network is part of by default, anomaly detection amounts to fraud detection. This paper investigates the use of trimmed k-means, that is capable of simultaneous clustering of objects and fraud detection in a multivariate setup, to detect fraudulent activity in Bitcoin transactions. The proposed approach detects more fraudulent transactions than similar studies or reports on the same dataset.

TI Neurotrophin-mimicking peptides at the biointerface with gold respond to
   copper ion stimuli
SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS
AB The peptide fragments NGF(1-14) and BDNF1-12, encompassing the N-terminal domains, respectively, of the proteins nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used in this study for the fabrication of a hybrid gold/peptide biointerface. These peptides mimic the Trk receptor activation of the respective whole protein - with a crucial role played by copper ions - and exhibit, in bulk solution, a pH-dependent capability to complex copper. We demonstrate here the maintenance of peptide-specific responses at different pH values as well as the copper binding also for the adlayers formed upon physisorption at the gold surface. The physicochemical properties, including viscoelastic behavior of the adlayer and competitive vs. synergic interactions in sequential adsorption processes, were addressed both experimentally, by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and circular dichroism (CD), and theoretically, by molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Proof-of work biological assays with the neuroblastoma SY-SH5H cell line demonstrated that the developed hybrid Au/peptide nanoplatforms are very promising for implementation in pH-and metal-responsive systems for application in nanomedicine.

AB Cloud computing has provided an attractive model for business service delivery. However, accountability aspects, mainly the monitoring of the execution of a service contract, liability assignment and dispute arbitration are still lacking. On the one hand, the traditional centralized monitoring and the trusted-third party (TTP) based arbitration solutions are not suitable for the distributed cloud environment. On the other hand, a decentralized solution also faces challenges in guaranteeing fairness, accuracy and sustainability. To address this issue, this paper firstly proposes an innovative service contract management scheme that facilitates the monitoring of the execution of a service contract in a peer-to-peer environment, inspired by the concept of blockchain in Bitcoin. Secondly, on top of the scheme it presents a novel dispute resolution protocol based on the Byzantine agreement and the commitment scheme. Thirdly, it identifies the optimal settings of the key parameters of the protocol through a set of experiments and scenario analysis, aiming to strike the balance of fairness, accuracy, incentive maximization for the honest arbiters and cost minimization for the overall arbitration process. With this approach, service participants can be held accountable in a truly distributed environment without the presence of a central authority, which increases businesses confidence on adopting cloud services.

SO YALE JOURNAL ON REGULATION
AB This Article looks at competing models for regulating providers of services to individuals and businesses that take cryptocurrencies in payment for goods and services, including operators of online wallets and exchanges, and other cryptocurrency market intermediaries whose functions resemble "money service businesses" or "money transmission." We conclude that, in addition to whatever "money services" or "money transmission" prudential regulation the States or federal government may adopt, the operation of wallets and exchanges requires a new commercial law that lays out rights and liabilities of cryptocurrency users in a robust and transparent fashion. We use Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code as a model for regulating cryptocurrency transactions in which intermediaries play a role.

TI A spring-block analogy for the dynamics of stock indexes
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB A spring-block chain placed on a running conveyor belt is considered for modeling stylized facts observed in the dynamics of stock indexes. Individual stocks are modeled by the blocks, while the stock-stock correlations are introduced via simple elastic forces acting in the springs. The dragging effect of the moving belt corresponds to the expected economic growth. The spring-block system produces collective behavior and avalanche like phenomena, similar to the ones observed in stock markets. An artificial index is defined for the spring-block chain, and its dynamics is compared with the one measured for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. For certain parameter regions the model reproduces qualitatively well the dynamics of the logarithmic index, the logarithmic returns, the distribution of the logarithmic returns, the avalanche-size distribution and the distribution of the investment horizons. A noticeable success of the model is that it is able to account for the gain-loss asymmetry observed in the inverse statistics. Our approach has mainly a pedagogical value, bridging between a complex socio-economic phenomena and a basic (mechanical) model in physics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI The Predecessors of Bitcoin and Their Implications for the Prospect of

SO PLOS ONE
AB To examine whether the recent price patterns and transaction costs of Bitcoin represent a general characteristic of decentralized virtual currencies, we analyze virtual currencies in online games that have been voluntarily managed by individuals since 1990s. We find that matured game currencies have price stability similar to that of small size equities or gold, and their transaction costs are sometimes lower than real currencies. Assuming that virtual currencies with a longer history can provide an estimate for Bitcoin's prospects, we project that Bitcoin will be less influenced by speculative trades and become a low cost alternative to real currencies.

In this paper, we present ZombieCoin, a botnet command-and-control (C&C) mechanism that runs on the Bitcoin network. ZombieCoin offers considerable advantages over existing C&C techniques, most notably the fact that Bitcoin is designed to resist the very regulatory processes currently used to combat botnets. We believe this is a desirable avenue botmasters may explore in the near future and our work is intended as a first step towards devising effective countermeasures.

AB Bitcoin has, since 2009, become an increasingly popular online currency, in large part because it resists regulation and provides anonymity. We discuss how Bitcoin has become both a highly useful tool for criminals and a lucrative target for crime, and argue that this arises from the same essential ideological and design choices that have driven Bitcoin's success to date. In this paper, we survey the landscape of Bitcoin-related crime, such as dark markets and bitcoin theft, and speculate about possible future possibilities, including tax evasion and money laundering.

AB We explore time-memory and other tradeoffs for memory-hard functions, which are supposed to impose significant computational and time penalties if less memory is used than intended. We analyze three finalists of the Password Hashing Competition: Catena, which was presented at Asiacrypt 2014, yescrypt and Lyra2.
   We demonstrate that Catena's proof of tradeoff resilience is flawed, and attack it with a novel precomputation tradeoff. We show that using M-4/5 memory instead of M we have no time penalties and reduce the AT cost by the factor of 25. We further generalize our method for a wide class of schemes with predictable memory access. For a wide class of data-dependent schemes, which addresses memory unpredictably, we develop a novel ranking tradeoff and show how to decrease the time-memory and the time-area product by significant factors. We then apply our method to yescrypt and Lyra2 also exploiting the iterative structure of their internal compression functions.
   The designers confirmed our attacks and responded by adding a new mode for Catena and tweaking Lyra2.

Relays credit users who submit shares with tickets that can later be used to purchase improved service. Both shares and tickets when sent over Tor circuits are anonymous. The analysis of the crypto-currencies market prices shows that the proposed scheme can compensate significant part of Tor relay operator's expenses.

AB A Bitcoin wallet is a set of private keys known to a user and which allow that user to spend any Bitcoin associated with those keys. In a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, child private keys are generated pseudorandomly from a master private key, and the corresponding child public keys can be generated by anyone with knowledge of the master public key. These wallets have several interesting applications including Internet retail, trustless audit, and a treasurer allocating funds among departments. A specification of HD wallets has even been accepted as Bitcoin standard BIP32.
   Unfortunately, in all existing HD wallets-including BIP32 walletsan attacker can easily recover the master private key given the master public key and any child private key. This vulnerability precludes use cases such as a combined treasurer-auditor, and some in the Bitcoin community have suspected that this vulnerability cannot be avoided.
   We propose a new HD wallet that is not subject to this vulnerability. Our HD wallet can tolerate the leakage of up to m private keys with a master public key size of O(m). We prove that breaking our HD wallet is at least as hard as the so-called "one more" discrete logarithm problem.

AB Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks have seen a rapid growth, spanning diverse applications like online anonymity (Tor), online payment (Bitcoin), file sharing (BitTorrent), etc. However, the success of these applications has raised concerns among ISPs and Network administrators. These types of traffic worsen the congestion of the network, and create security vulner-abilities. Hence, P2P traffic identification has been researched actively in recent times. Early P2P traffic identification approaches were based on port-based inspection. Presently, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is a prominent technique used to identify P2P traffic. But it relies on payload signatures which are not resilient against port masquerading, traffic encryption and NATing. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P traffic identification mechanism based on the host behaviour from the transport layer headers. A set of heuristics was identified by analysing the off-line datasets collected in our testbed. This approach is privacy preserving as it does not examine the payload content. The usefulness of these heuristics is shown on real-time traffic traces received from our campus backbone; where in the best case only 0.20% of flows were unknown.

TI A comparative analysis of personality pathology profiles among patients
   with pure depressive-, pure anxiety-, and pure somatoform disorders
SO JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
AB Background: Depressive-, anxiety-, and somatoform disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders. The assessment of comorbid personality pathology or traits in these disorders is relevant, because it can lead to the exacerbation of them or to poorer remission rates. To date, no research findings have been published on the comparison of these three prevalent patient groups with regard to comorbid dimensional personality pathology.
   Methods: Data of participants (18-60 years) came from a web-based Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) programme. The present study used baseline data and was designed to compare personality pathology profiles between three separate outpatient groups: pure anxiety disorders (n=1633), pure depressive disorders (n-1794), and pure somatoform disorders (n-479). Personality pathology was measured with the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology-Short Form (DAPP-SF).
   Results: The pure depressive disorder group, in comparison to the other two disorder groups, exhibited the worst psychopathological and functional health image and most personality pathology. In the pure anxiety disorder group, the highest mean was found for the personality trait Anxiousness; and in the pure depressive disorder group for the traits Identity problems, Affective lability, Anxiousness, and Restricted expression. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of the study limits the conclusions that can be drawn.
   Conclusions: The assessment of comorbid personality pathology in depressive-, anxiety-, somatoform disorders is clinically relevant, whether a patient has a personality disorder or not. This way, treatment could partly be focused on specific personality traits that may be counterproductive for treatment outcome, especially in depressive disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

TI The effect of two novel cholesterol-lowering agents, disodium ascorbyl
   phytostanol phosphate (DAPP) and nanostructured aluminosilicate (NSAS)
   on the expression and activity of P-glycoprotein within Caco-2 cells
SO LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB Background: Many drugs are substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and interactions involving P-gp may be relevant to clinical practice. Co-administration with P-gp inhibitors or inducers changes the absorption profile as well as the risk for drug toxicity, therefore it is important to evaluate possible P-gp alterations. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of two novel cholesterol-lowering agents, disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate (DAPP) and nanostructured aluminium silicate (NSAS), a protonated montmorillonite clay, on mdr-1 gene expression and its protein, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) within Caco-2 cells.
   Methods: The effects of DAPP and NSAS on the regulation of mdr-1 gene, P-gp protein expression and activity within Caco-2 cells, were determined using cell viability and cytotoxicity tests, RT-PCR, Western Blot analysis and bi-directional transport studies.
   Results: We observed a significant down-regulation of mdr-1 mRNA (e.g. 38.5 +/- 17% decrease vs. control at 5 mu M DAPP and 61.2 +/- 25% versus control at 10 mu M DAPP; n = 6, P* < 0.05) within Caco-2 cells. Western Blot analysis of P-gp expression showed that changes in mdr-1 gene expression lead to correlating changes in P-gp protein expression. This down-regulation of P-glycoprotein also resulted in decreased activity of P-glycoprotein compared to untreated control. In contrast, when Caco-2 cells were treated with NSAS, no changes in mdr-1 gene expression, P-gp protein expression nor P-gp activity were observed.
   Conclusions: DAPP but not NSAS decreases P-gp mediated drug efflux through decreased mdr-1 gene expression and consequently decreased P-gp protein expression. These findings have to be taken into consideration when DAPP is concurrently given with other drugs that are substrates for P-gp since drug-drug interactions harbour a safety issue and alter bioavailability profiles.
   NSAS does not have any P-gp altering properties and therefore might not affect drug-drug interactions. We conclude from this study that NSAS might make a safer drug candidate compared to DAPP for lowering LDL-cholesterol.

TI OF BITCOINS, INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY SOFTWARE, AND THE ZERO-MEMBER LLC
SO NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
AB An innovative software technology known as Bitcoin makes it easier for software to operate with some degree of financial autonomy. In a meaningful sense, it is now possible for software to conduct business on its own account, without using the traditional financial system as an intermediary and without a financial existence tied to an existing natural or legal person. This Essay explores this possibility and suggests that legally autonomous entities, such as a limited liability company (LLC) with no members, are a useful legal structure for factually autonomous systems.

AB Fair-exchange and anonymity are two important attributes in e-commerce. It is much more difficult to expect fairness in e-commerce transactions using Bitcoin due to anonymity and transaction irreversibility. Genuine consumers and merchants who would like to make and receive payments using Bitcoin may be reluctant to do so due to this uncertainty. The proposed protocol guarantees strong-fairness while preserving anonymity of the consumer and the merchant, using Bitcoin as a payment method which addresses the aforementioned concern. The involvement of the trusted third party (TTP) is kept to a minimum, which makes the protocol optimistic and the exchanged product is not revealed to TTP. It achieves dispute resolution within the protocol run without any intervention of an external judge. Finally we show how the protocol can be easily adapted to use other digital cash systems designed using public ledgers such as Zerocoin/Zerocash.

TI The role of co-morbid personality pathology in predicting self-reported
   aggression in patients with schizophrenia
SO COMPREHENSIVE PSYCHIATRY
AB Background: Personality pathology affects behavioral patterns in patients with schizophrenia notwithstanding psychotic symptomatology. An investigation of the role of co-morbid personality pathology in the occurrence of aggression in schizophrenia is explored using both categorical and dimensional approaches to personality pathology.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study we evaluate, in 97 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, the effect of personality pathology on the occurrence of aggression in schizophrenia using both a categorical approach, as described in DSM-IV-TR Axis II, and a dimensional approach, as operationalized in the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology Basic Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ). We also employ mediation analyses to explore the extent to which dimensions within the DAPP mediate the relationship between co-morbid personality disorders and aggression.
   Results: Personality pathology accounts for aggression in schizophrenia. Both the categorical and the dimensional approaches equally well account for the occurrence of aggression, with each model accounting for 60% of the variance. Interestingly, the mediation analysis reveals that the association between categorically defined personality pathology and aggression is substantially mediated by the higher-order-trait dissocial behavior of the DAPP-BQ, accounting for 50.6 % of the total effect size.
   Conclusion: Personality pathology can be a significant predictor of aggression in patients with schizophrenia. While both the categorical and the dimensional trait models of personality disorders equally explain the aggression data, much of the relationship between the categorically defined personality disorders and the occurrence of aggression in schizophrenia can be explained by the presence of dissocial behavior as operationalized in the DAPP-BQ dimensional model.

TI Validation of the FFM PD count technique for screening personality
   pathology in later middle-aged and older adults
SO AGING & MENTAL HEALTH
AB Research on the applicability of the five factor model (FFM) to capture personality pathology coincided with the development of a FFM personality disorder (PD) count technique, which has been validated in adolescent, young, and middle-aged samples. This study extends the literature by validating this technique in an older sample. Five alternative FFM PD counts based upon the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R) are computed and evaluated in terms of both convergent and divergent validity with the Assessment of DSM-IV Personality Disorders Questionnaire (shortly ADP-IV; DSM-IV, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth edition). For the best working count for each PD normative data are presented, from which cut-off scores are derived. The validity of these cut-offs and their usefulness as a screening tool is tested against both a categorical (i.e., the DSM-IV Text Revision), and a dimensional (i.e., the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology; DAPP) measure of personality pathology. All but the Antisocial and Obsessive-Compulsive counts exhibited adequate convergent and divergent validity, supporting the use of this method in older adults. Using the ADP-IV and the DAPP Short Form as validation criteria, results corroborate the use of the FFM PD count technique to screen for PDs in older adults, in particular for the Paranoid, Borderline, Histrionic, Avoidant, and Dependent PDs. Given the age-neutrality of the NEO PI-R and the considerable lack of valid personality assessment tools, current findings appear to be promising for the assessment of pathology in older adults.

TI Syndiotactic Polyallyltrimethylsilane-Based Stereoregular Diblock
   Copolymers: Syntheses and Self-Assembled Nanostructures
SO MACROMOLECULES
AB Structurally well-defined stereoregular diblock copolymers composed of syndiotactic polyallyltrimethylsilane (sPATMS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were prepared by using an alpha-bromoester-terminated sPATMS macroinitiator, which was chain extended by MMA using a cuprous halide-based atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) system. The alpha-bromoester-terminated sPATMS macroinitiator was prepared via the esterfication of hydroxyl-capped sPATMS with alpha-bromoisobutyryl bromide. The hydroxyl-capped sPATMS was generated via a selective chain transfer reaction to triethylaluminum (TEA) during the syndiospecific polymerization of allyltrimethylsilane (ATMS) conducted in the presence of syndiospecific ansa-metallocene catalysts. The proposed synthetic route not only offers the high-yield production of stereoregular sPATMS-b-PMMA but also provides the linking of the stereoregular block (sPATMS) with PMMA through a controlled/living radical polymerization process. Moreover, the proposed method offers effective control over the block chain length, the molecular weight distribution (M-w/M-n) and the stereoregularity of sPATMS block. Thus, the self-assembly of the resultant diblock copolymers produces well-ordered nanostructures from microphase separation, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering results.

TI Dietary supplementation with phytosterol and ascorbic acid reduces body
   mass accumulation and alters food transit time in a diet-induced obesity
   mouse model
SO LIPIDS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE
AB Previous research indicates that animals fed a high fat (HF) diet supplemented with disodium ascorbyl phytostanyl phosphate (DAPP) exhibit reduced mass accumulation when compared to HF control. This compound is a water-soluble phytostanol ester and consists of a hydrophobic plant stanol covalently bonded to ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). To provide insight into the mechanism of this response, we examined the in vivo effects of a high fat diet supplemented with ascorbic acid (AA) in the presence and absence of unesterified phytosterols (PS), and set out to establish whether the supplements have a synergistic effect in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Our data indicate that HF diet supplementation with a combination of 1% w/w phytosterol and 1% w/w ascorbic acid results in reduced mass accumulation, with mean differences in absolute mass between PSAA and HF control of 10.05%; and differences in mass accumulation of 21.6% (i.e. the PSAA group gained on average 21% less mass each week from weeks 7-12 than the HF control group). In our previous study, the absolute mass difference between the 2% DAPP and HF control was 41%, while the mean difference in mass accumulation between the two groups for weeks 7-12 was 67.9%. Mass loss was not observed in animals supplemented with PS or AA alone. These data suggest that the supplements are synergistic with respect to mass accumulation, and the esterification of the compounds further potentiates the response. Our data also indicate that chronic administration of PS, both in the presence and absence of AA, results in changes to fecal output and food transit time, providing insight into the possibility of long-term changes in intestinal function related to PS supplementation.

TI Self-assembly of ABC dendrimer by real-space self-consistent mean field
   theory in a two-dimensional space
SO SOFT MATTER
AB Microphases and triangle phase diagrams of ABC dendrimers with different chain lengths of the second generation are investigated by a real-space implementation of self-consistent mean field theory in a two-dimensional (2D) space. Seven main stable ordered morphologies have been observed in the intermediate-segregation regime, including "three-color" lamellae phase (LAM(3)), "three-color" hexagonal honeycomb phase (HEX3), dodecagon-hexagon-tetragon phase (DOHT), octagon-octagon-tetragon phase (OOT), lamellae phase with alternating beads (LAM + AB), decagon-hexagon-tetragon and decagon-hexagon-hexagon phase ([DEHT; DEHH]), and core-shell hexagonal lattice phase (CSH). Simulation experiments reveal that when the volume fractions of three different polymer block species are comparable, the dendritic molecular architecture of the polymer chain has a strong topological constraint on the geometry of microphases. In a particular range of volume fractions f(a) approximate to f(b) approximate to f(c), the HEX3 phase is found to be the most stable. In addition, near the region of HEX3 in the triangle phase diagrams, another competitive microphase (OOT) has an energy which is close to HEX3 was found to be stable as well. However, when the volume fraction of one block species is big enough, such as f(a) (or f(b), f(c)) >= 0.7, especially in the system of ABC dendrimer with equivalent block chain of the second generation and asymmetric interaction parameters, the influence of dendritic architecture on the morphologies is not so obvious. If the chain topology of the dendrimer does not stretch sufficiently, then it displays a LAM + AB microphase as linear ABC terpolymer.

AB Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities are one of the major concerns in today's internet. Client-puzzles offer a good mechanism to defend servers against DoS attacks. In this paper, we introduce the notion of hidden puzzle difficulty, where the attacker cannot determine the difficulty of the puzzle without expending a minimal amount of computational resource. We propose three concrete puzzles that satisfy this requirement. Using game theory, we show that a defense mechanism is more effective when it uses a hidden difficulty puzzle. Based on the concept of Nash equilibrium, we develop suitable defense mechanisms that are better than the existing ones.

SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB This study investigates the day-of-the-week effect on both return and volatility of Bitcoin (BTC) from January 2013 to December 2018 using daily data obtained from CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Estimation results suggest that the day-of-the-week effect in return equation varies with sample periods, while significantly high volatilities are observed on Monday and Thursday. Hence, the significantly high mean return of Bitcoin on Monday is found as a response to higher volatility. Besides, the day-of-the-week effect on both return and volatility remains robust after accounting for stock market returns (S&P 500; SSEC; Nikkei 225) and foreign exchange market returns (USD/CNY; USD/JPY; EURO/USD). Finally, no asymmetry effect on volatility is discovered here.

AB With the dramatically increasing deployment of IoT devices, storing and protecting the large volume of IoT data has become a significant issue. Traditional cloud-based IoT structures impose extremely high computation and storage demands on the cloud servers. Meanwhile, the strong dependencies on the centralized servers bring significant trust issues. To mitigate these problems, we propose a distributed data storage scheme employing blockchain and cetrificateless cryptography. Our scheme eliminates the traditional centralized servers by leveraging the blockchain miners who perform "transaction" verifications and records audit with the help of certificateless cryptography. We present a clear definition of the transactions in a non-cryptocurrency system and illustrate how the transactions are processed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work designing a secure and accountable IoT storage system using blockchain. Additionally, we extend our scheme to enable data trading and elaborate how data trading can be efficiently and effectively achieved.

TI The Socio-Technological Lives of Bitcoin
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and blockchains have become buzzwords in the media and are attracting increasing academic interest, mainly from the fields of computer science and financial economics. In this essay, I argue that cryptocurrencies and blockchains are important objects of general social science research and thought, but not for their 'moneyness' per se. Through a historical sociology of the antecedents and discourse leading up to Bitcoin, I show that it was never meant to be 'money' in the economic sense, but rather a solution to a technical puzzle for preventing opportunistic actors from double-spending digital 'coins,' as well as a fervent ideology surrounding online privacy and infringement of individual rights in the digital age. Drawing from themes in science and technology studies, I suggest that Bitcoin and other 'cryptoassets' are properly socio-technological assemblages that constitute new and important objects of social inquiry that must be understood beyond the myopic context of crypto-money. I conclude by proposing three alternative ontologies for blockchains relevant to economic, political, and social life: as systems of accounting, as organizational forms, and as institutions in their own right.

TI On big data, artificial intelligence and smart cities
SO CITIES
AB Cities are increasingly turning towards specialized technologies to address issues related to society, ecology, morphology and many others. The emerging concept of Smart Cities highly encourages this prospect by promoting the incorporation of sensors and Big Data through the Internet of Things (IoT). This surge of data brings new possibilities in the design and management of cities just as much as economic prospects. While Big Data processing through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can greatly contribute to the urban fabric, sustainability and liveability dimensions however must not be overlooked in favour of technological ones. This paper reviews the urban potential of AI and proposes a new framework binding AI technology and cities while ensuring the integration of key dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance; which are known to be primordial in the successful integration of Smart Cities for the compliance to the Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This paper is aimed towards Policy Makers, Data Scientists and Engineers who are looking at enhancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Smart Cities with an aim to increase the liveability of the urban fabric while boosting economic growth and opportunities.

TI Cloud-assisted secure eHealth systems for tamper-proofing EHR via
   blockchain
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB The wide deployment of cloud-assisted electronic health (eHealth) systems has already shown great benefits in managing electronic health records (EHRs) for both medical institutions and patients. However, it also causes critical security concerns. Since once a medical institution generates and outsources the patients' EHRs to cloud servers, patients would not physically own their EHRs but the medical institution can access the EHRs as needed for diagnosing, it makes the EHRs integrity protection a formidable task, especially in the case that a medical malpractice occurs, where the medical institution may collude with the cloud server to tamper with the outsourced EHRs to hide the medical malpractice. Traditional cryptographic primitives for the purpose of data integrity protection cannot be directly adopted because they cannot ensure the security in the case of collusion between the cloud server and medical institution.
   In this paper, a secure cloud-assisted eHealth system is proposed to protect outsourced EHRs from illegal modification by using the blockchain technology (blockchain-based currencies, e.g., Ethereum). The key idea is that the EHRs only can be outsourced by authenticated participants and each operation on outsourcing EHRs is integrated into the public blockchain as a transaction. Since the blockchain-based currencies provide a tamper-proofing way to conduct transactions without a central authority, the EHRs cannot be modified after the corresponding transaction is recorded into the blockchain. Therefore, given outsourced EHRs, any participant can check their integrity by checking the corresponding transaction. Security analysis and performance evaluation demonstrate that the proposed system can provide a strong security guarantee with a high efficiency. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain-Enabled Wireless Internet of Things: Performance Analysis and
   Optimal Communication Node Deployment
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB Blockchain has shown a great potential in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems for establishing trust and consensus mechanisms without involvement of any third party. Understanding the relationship between communication and blockchain as well as the performance constraints posing on the counterparts can facilitate designing a dedicated blockchain-enabled IoT systems. In this paper, we establish an analytical model for the blockchain-enabled wireless IoT system. By considering spatio-temporal domain Poisson distribution, i.e., node geographical distribution in spatial domain and transaction arrival rate in time domain are both modeled as Poisson point process (PPP), we first derive the distribution of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), blockchain transaction successful rate as well as overall throughput. Based on the system model and performance analysis, we design an algorithm to determine the optimal full function node deployment for blockchain system under the criterion of maximizing transaction throughput. Finally, the security performance is analyzed in the proposed networks with three typical attacks. Solutions such as physical layer security are presented and discussed to keep the system secure under these attacks. Numerical results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and optimal node deployment algorithm.

TI Towards an Autonomous Industry 4.0 Warehouse: A UAV and Blockchain-Based
   System for Inventory and Traceability Applications in Big Data-Driven
   Supply Chain Management
SO SENSORS
AB Industry 4.0 has paved the way for a world where smart factories will automate and upgrade many processes through the use of some of the latest emerging technologies. One of such technologies is Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which have evolved a great deal in the last years in terms of technology (e.g., control units, sensors, UAV frames) and have significantly reduced their cost. UAVs can help industry in automatable and tedious tasks, like the ones performed on a regular basis for determining the inventory and for preserving item traceability. In such tasks, especially when it comes from untrusted third parties, it is essential to determine whether the collected information is valid or true. Likewise, ensuring data trustworthiness is a key issue in order to leverage Big Data analytics to supply chain efficiency and effectiveness. In such a case, blockchain, another Industry 4.0 technology that has become very popular in other fields like finance, has the potential to provide a higher level of transparency, security, trust and efficiency in the supply chain and enable the use of smart contracts. Thus, in this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a UAV-based system aimed at automating inventory tasks and keeping the traceability of industrial items attached to Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. To confront current shortcomings, such a system is developed under a versatile, modular and scalable architecture aimed to reinforce cyber security and decentralization while fostering external audits and big data analytics. Therefore, the system uses a blockchain and a distributed ledger to store certain inventory data collected by UAVs, validate them, ensure their trustworthiness and make them available to the interested parties. In order to show the performance of the proposed system, different tests were performed in a real industrial warehouse, concluding that the system is able to obtain the inventory data really fast in comparison to traditional manual tasks, while being also able to estimate the position of the items when hovering over them thanks to their tag's signal strength. In addition, the performance of the proposed blockchain-based architecture was evaluated in different scenarios.

TI Blockchain-Based Settlement for Asset Trading
SO REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES
AB Can securities be settled on a blockchain, and, if so, what are the gains relative to existing settlement systems? The main benefit of a blockchain is faster and more flexible settlement, whereas settlement fails need to be ruled out where participants fork the chain to cancel trading losses. With a proof-of-work protocol, the blockchain needs to restrict settlement speed through block size and time in order to generate transaction fees, which finance costly mining. Despite mining being a deadweight cost, our estimates for the U.S. corporate debt market yield net gains from a blockchain in the range of 1-4 bps.

AB We review the literature and examine the effects of shocks on bitcoin returns. We assess the effects of factors such as stock market returns, exchange rates, gold and oil returns, FED's and ECB's rates and internet trends on bitcoin returns. Alternative VAR and FAVAR models are employed and generalized as well as local impulse response functions are produced. Our results reveal (i) a significant interaction between bitcoin and traditional stock markets, (ii) a weaker interaction with FX markets and the macroeconomy and (iii) an anemic importance of popularity measures. Lastly, we reveal the increased impact of Asian markets on bitcoin compared to other geographically-defined markets, which however appears to have waned in the last two years after the Chinese regulatory interventions and the sudden contraction of CNY's share in bitcoin trading volume.

TI Is Bitcoin a hedge or safe haven for currencies? An intraday analysis
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB Bitcoin has attracted a wealth of attention in the media and by investors alike and this paper investigates whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge or safe haven against world currencies. Contrary to previous studies, we assess the relationship between Bitcoin and currencies at the hourly frequency since Bitcoin experiences quite large volatility throughout the day. We employ a ADCC model and find that Bitcoin can be an intraday hedge for the CHF, EUR and GBP, but acts as a diversifier for the AUD, CAD and JPY. We also implement the non-temporal Hansen (2000) test to examine the safe haven properties of Bitcoin and find that Bitcoin is a safe haven during periods of extreme market turmoil for the CAD, CHF and GBP. Therefore our results indicate that Bitcoin does act as an intraday hedge, diversifier and safe haven for certain currencies, which will be of great interest to currency, cryptocurrency and high frequency investors alike.

TI A Proof-of-Trust Consensus Protocol for Enhancing Accountability in
   Crowdsourcing Services
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING
AB Incorporating accountability mechanisms in online services requires effective trust management and immutable, traceable source of truth for transaction evidence. The emergence of the blockchain technology brings in high hopes for fulfilling most of those requirements. However, a major challenge is to find a proper consensus protocol that is applicable to the crowdsourcing services in particular and online services in general. Building upon the idea of using blockchain as the underlying technology to enable tracing transactions for service contracts and dispute arbitration, this paper proposes a novel consensus protocol that is suitable for the crowdsourcing as well as the general online service industry. The new consensus protocol is called "Proof-of-Trust" (PoT) consensus; it selects transaction validators based on the service participants' trust values while leveraging RAFT leader election and Shamir's secret sharing algorithms. The PoT protocol avoids the low throughput and resource intensive pitfalls associated with Bitcoin' s "Proof-of-Work" (PoW) mining, while addressing the scalability issue associated with the traditional Paxos-based and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based algorithms. In addition, it addresses the unfaithful behaviors that cannot be dealt with in the traditional BFT algorithms. The paper demonstrates that our approach can provide a viable accountability solution for the online service industry.

TI SURVIVOR: A blockchain based edge-as-a-service framework for secure
   energy trading in SDN-enabled vehicle-to-grid environment
SO COMPUTER NETWORKS
AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have transformed the smart transportation sector by providing diverse energy management solutions to the smart grid. Energy trading among EVs and charging stations (CS) in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) environment is one of the popular verticals in smart grid. However, processing the energy trading decisions at remote control centers lead to an increase in delay and network overhead. Apart from these issues, the security concerns while trading the energy in such an environment remain persistent. Therefore, to handle the aforementioned issues, this paper presents SURVIVOR: A Blockchain based Edge-as-a-Service Framework for Secure Energy Trading in software defined networking (SDN)-enabled V2G Environment. In the proposed framework, the energy trading decisions are processed closer to the location of EVs through edge nodes. Moreover, for securing the energy trading transactions, blockchain is used wherein the approver nodes are selected amongst all the present nodes on the basis of a utility function and are made responsible for validating the transactions. Once such nodes are selected, a consensus based blockchain mechanism for secure energy trading in SDN-enabled V2G environment is presented. In this mechanism, edge nodes are responsible for generating proof-of-work puzzles. The proof-of-work is a unique hash value which is computed for each EV and the transactions for which the approver nodes compute the same proof-of-work for each EV are added in the blockchain. The complete scheme is backed by the SDN architecture to reduce the overall latency and increase the throughput of the smart transportation network. The results obtained prove that the proposed scheme is effective for trading the energy between EVs and CS while securing the underlying trading transactions using blockchain. Moreover, the communication and computation cost of the proposed scheme comes out to be small which proves that it can be used in real-world applications. The latency in the complete transportation sector is also greatly reduced by using the SDN-architecture. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Following the new advances in encryption and network computing, Bitcoin emerged as a private sector system facilitating peer-to-peer exchange via distributed ledgers based on blockchains, driving a transformational change towards a global economy outside the core financial system. The main purpose of this paper is to examine the multifractal properties of the Bitcoin price using high frequency data. The methods used are the wavelet transform modulus maxima and the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The results indicate that Bitcoin exhibits a large degree of multifractality in all examined time intervals, and the main source of multifractality is attributed to the high kurtosis and the fat distributional tails of the series returns.

TI Novel Automatic Food Trading System Using Consortium Blockchain
SO ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
AB Conventional food trading platforms face several issues, such as quickly to find trading objects and protect the reliability of transaction information. With e-commerce developing rapidly, food trading has also recently shifted to the online domain. Blockchain has changed many industries owing to its robustness, decentralization and end-to-end credibility. This paper proposes a novel Food Trading System with COnsortium blockchaiN (FTSCON) to improve trust and security issues in transactions. It uses consortium blockchain technology to set permission and authentication for different roles in food transaction, which meet the challenge of the privacy protection of multi-stakeholders. The algorithm of optimized transaction combination is designed for the purpose of helping users find suitable transaction objects. It can choose the optimized trading portfolio for buyers. The online double auction mechanism is used to eliminate competition. And the improved PBFT (iPBFT) is used to enhance efficiency of system. Moreover, a smart-contract life- cycle management method is introduced, and security analysis shows that FTSCON improves transaction security and privacy protection. Experiment results based on a series of data indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve profit improvement of merchants.

AB This paper uses wavelet coherence and cross wavelet transform approaches to examine co-movement between Bitcoin and five major cryptocurrencies (Dash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero and Ripple) and their portfolio risk implications. The results show evidence of co-movements in time frequency space with leading relationships of Bitcoin with Dash, Monero and Ripple, lagging relationship with Ethereum, and out of phase movements with Litecoin. By considering different portfolios (risk-minimizing portfolio, equally weighted portfolio and hedging portfolio), we show evidence that a mixed portfolio (Bitcoin with other cryptocurrencies) provides better diversification benefits for investors and portfolio managers. Finally, an Ethereum-Bitcoin (Monero-Bitcoin) hedging portfolio offers the highest risk reductions and hedging effectiveness under medium and long term (short term) horizon. The results of downside risk reductions are time horizon dependent.

SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB In the era of big data, the produced and collected data explode due to the emerging technologies and applications that pervade everywhere in our daily lives, including internet of things applications such as smart home, smart city, smart grid, e-commerce applications and social network. Big data market can carry out efficient data trading, which provides a way to share data and further enhances the utility of data. However, to realize effective data trading in big data market, several challenges need to be resolved. The first one is to verify the data availability for a data consumer. The second is privacy of a data provider who is unwilling to reveal his real identity to the data consumer. The third is the payment fairness between a data provider and a data consumer with atomic exchange. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new blockchain-based fair data trading protocol in big data market. The proposed protocol integrates ring signature, double authentication-preventing signature and similarity learning to guarantee the availability of trading data, privacy of data providers and fairness between data providers and data consumers. We show the proposed protocol achieves the desirable security properties that a secure data trading protocol should have. The implementation results with Solidity smart contract demonstrate the validity of the proposed blockchain-based fair data trading protocol. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI MOF-BC: A memory optimized and flexible blockchain for large scale
   networks
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB The inherent immutability offered by Blockchains (BC) ensures resilience against modification or removal of the stored data. In large scale networks like the Internet of Things (loT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible BC (MOF-BC) that enables the loT users and service providers to remove or summarize their transactions and age their data and thus exercise their "right to be forgotten". To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for different transactions. However, to facilitate removal of the stored transactions in the future, all keys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage. MOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed hash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction to provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the information that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a reward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing memory consumption. We propose MOF-BC as a generalized solution, which can be implemented on top of any existing or future BC instantiation. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that MOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks. Evaluation results show that MOF-BC decreases BC memory consumption by up to 25% and the cost incurred by users by more than two orders of magnitude compared to conventional BC instantiations.

The interactions between humans and machines are intense and their synergistic reactions have attracted special attention for the reason of forming so called Human-Machine Networks (HMN). HMNs refer to these networks where humans and machines work together to provide synergistic effects on their payoffs. Game theory, which can capture the interactions among players dexterously, has been widely used in solving various problems in HMN systems from the view of economics. In this paper, we extensively review the literature about game theoretical methods in HMNs, in particular focusing on its typical systems such as crowdsourcing, an elemental HMN and Internet of Things (IoT), a hybrid HMN, as well as Bitcoin. We propose a series of requirements to evaluate existing work. For reviewing and analyzing each system, we specify application purposes, players, strategies, game models and equilibria based on our proposed requirements. In the sequel, we identify a number of common and distinct open issues in HMNs and point out future research directions. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI Public blockchain evaluation using entropy and TOPSIS
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchains have attracted worldwide attention in recent years. With the increasing number of public blockchains, the evaluation of public blockchains becomes meaningful. This paper aims to make a comprehensive evaluation of public blockchains from multiple dimensions. Three first-level indicators and eleven second-level indicators are designed to evaluate the public blockchains. The technique for order preferences by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is used to rank public blockchains. The entropy method is used to calculate the weights of different indicators objectively. Since Bitcoin has an absolute advantage, a let-the-first-out (LFO) strategy is proposed to reduce the criteria of the positive ideal solution and make a more reasonable evaluation. The evaluation indicators and the ranking results of public blockchains can provide related researchers and managers with references and support their decisions. The three first-level indicators are technology, recognition, and activity. Their weights are 16.80%, 59.00%, and 24.20% respectively. The evaluation result shows that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and EOS are ranked in the top three public blockchains. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Designing blockchain-based applications a case study for imported
   product traceability
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Blockchain technology enables decentralization as new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can reach agreements on the shared system states without trusting on a central integration point. Since blockchain is an emerging technology which is still at an early stage of development, there is limited experience on applying blockchain to real-world software applications. We applied blockchain application design approaches proposed in software architecture community in a real-world project called originChain, which is a blockchain-based traceability system that restructures the current system by replacing the central database with blockchain. In this paper, we share our experience of building originChain. By using blockchain and designing towards security, originChain provides transparent tamper-proof traceability data with high availability and enables automated regulatory-compliance checking and adaptation in product traceability scenarios. We also demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the software architecture of originChain. Based on our experience and analysis, we found that the structural design of smart contracts has large impact on the quality of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Management and Monitoring of IoT Devices Using Blockchain
SO SENSORS
AB Nowadays, we are surrounded by a large number of IoT (Internet of Things) devices and sensors. These devices are designed to make life easier and more comfortable. Blockchain technology, especially its mass application, is becoming a term number one. Adoption of blockchain into enterprise networks still has a few challenges that need to be tackled. Utilizing blockchain can bring increased security and efficiency of network maintenance. The key feature of the blockchain, immutability, brings resistance to unauthorized modifications. The whole history of device configuration changes is stored in the blockchain, hence recovery after incidents is very straightforward. This paper extends our previous studies. We are introducing an improved architecture for management and monitoring of IoT devices using a private blockchain. The majority of the system is built on a chaincode, which handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations as well as encryption and access control. Device configuration files are stored in the blockchain. When a modification occurs, the device downloads a new configuration in a simple manner. The chaincode receives notification whether setup was successful and this history is available for administrators. Our results show that such a system is possible and dissemination of configuration changes to IoT devices can be secured by the blockchain. The key novelty of our solution is a distributed management of configuration files of IoT devices in enterprise networks utilizing blockchain technology. This is essentially improving security and storage options for configurations in the blockchain.

TI Conditional tail-risk in cryptocurrency markets
SO JOURNAL OF EMPIRICAL FINANCE
AB In this paper we use CoVaR to estimate the conditional tail-risk in the markets for bitcoin, ether, ripple and litecoin and find that these cryptocurrencies are highly exposed to tail-risk within cryptomarkets, while they are not exposed to tail-risk with respect to other global assets, like the U.S. equity market or gold. Although cryptocurrency returns are, highly correlated one with the other, we find that idiosyncratic risk can be significantly reduced and that portfolios of cryptocurrencies offer better risk-adjusted and conditional returns than individual cryptocurrencies. These results indicate that portfolios of cryptocurrencies could offer attractive returns and hedging properties when included in investors' portfolios. However, when we account for liquidity, the share of crypto assets in investors' optimal portfolio is small.

   study
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB This research explores the effects of adding bitcoin to an optimal portfolio (naive, long-only, semi-constrained with and without bitcoin shorting) by relying on the mean-CVaR approach. We explore bitcoin's role in portfolios of U.S., European and Chinese assets. We back-test to compare the performance of portfolios with and without bitcoin for each scenario. The results show that by adding bitcoin, the portfolio performance improves; but this is due more to the increase in returns than in the reduction of volatility. In addition, the improvement is linked to bitcoin's performance in 2013. We conclude that bitcoin may have a role in portfolio diversification even though our analysis confirms bitcoin speculative characteristics.

AB Block chain is a decentralized core architecture, which is widely used in emerging digital encryption currencies. It has attracted much attention and has been researched with the gradual acceptance of bitcoin. Block chaining technology has the characteristics of centralization, block data, no tampering and trust, so it is sought after by enterprises, especially financial institutions. This paper expounds the core technology principle of block chain technology, discusses the application of block chain technology, the existing regulatory problems and security problems, so as to provide some help for the related research of block chain technology. Intrusion detection is an important way to protect the security of information systems. It has become the focus of security research in recent years. This paper introduces the history and current situation of intrusion detection system, expounds the classification of intrusion detection system and the framework of general intrusion detection, and discusses all kinds of intrusion detection technology in detail. Intrusion detection technology is a kind of security technology to protect network resources from hacker attack. IDS is a useful supplement to the firewall, which can help the network system to quickly detect attacks and improve the integrity of the information security infrastructure. In this paper, intrusion detection technology is applied to block chain information security model, and the results show that proposed model has higher detection efficiency and fault tolerance.

TI EdgeCare: Leveraging Edge Computing for Collaborative Data Management in
   Mobile Healthcare Systems
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB With the wide application of mobile healthcare systems, the total amount of healthcare data is ever increasing rapidly as users interact with healthcare service providers frequently. This leads to a challenging task to manage healthcare data. Existing work mainly pay attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But they cannot adapt to the increasing amount of global healthcare data and suffer from complex application challenges, respectively. Decentralized and collaborative data management assisted by edge computing exhibits major advantages in improving overall system performance. We present a secure and efficient data management system named as EdgeCare for mobile healthcare systems. Local authorities are established to schedule edge servers for processing healthcare data and facilitating data trading. A hierarchical architecture with collaboration is designed for feasible implementation of EdgeCare. After that, we investigate secure data uploading and sharing in the system. We use an electronic medical record to show how healthcare data is processed with security considerations. We also conduct the Stackelberg game-based optimization algorithm to approach the optimal incentive mechanism for a data collector and users in the fair decentralized data trading. The numerical results with security analysis are provided to demonstrate that EdgeCare offers effective solutions to protect healthcare data, and support efficient data trading.

TI Network Layer Aspects of Permissionless Blockchains
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Permissionless blockchains reach decentralized consensus without requiring pre-established identities or trusted third parties, thus enabling applications such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Consensus is agreed on data that is generated by the application and transmitted by the system's (peer-to-peer) network layer. While many attacks on the network layer were discussed so far, there is no systematic approach that brings together known attacks, the requirements, and the design space of the network layer. In this paper, we survey attacks on the network layer of permissionless blockchains, and derive five requirements: 1) performance; 2) low cost of participation; 3) anonymity; 4) DoS resistance; and 5) topology hiding. Furthermore, we survey the design space of the network layer and qualitatively show the effect of each design decisions on the fulfillment of the requirements. Finally, we pick two aspects of the design space, in-band peer discovery and relay delay, and demonstrate possible directions of future research by quantitatively analyzing and optimizing simplified scenarios. We show that while most design decisions imply certain tradeoffs, there is a lack of models that analyze and formalize these tradeoffs. Such models could aid the design of the network layer of permissionless blockchains. One reason for the lack of models is the deliberately limited observability of deployed blockchains. We emphasize that simulation based approaches cope with these limitations and are suited for the analysis of the network layer of permissionless blockchains.

AB Edge computing is an important tool for smart computing, which brings convenience to data processing as well as security problems. In particular, the security of data storage under edge computing has become an obstacle to its widespread use. To solve the problem, the mechanism combing blockchain with regeneration coding is proposed to improve the security and reliability of stored data under edge computing. Our contribution is as follows. 1) According to the three-tier edge computing architecture and data security storage requirements, we proposed hybrid storage architecture and model specifically adapted to edge computing. 2) Making full use of the data storage advantages of edge network devices and cloud storage servers, we build a global blockchain in the cloud service layer and local blockchain is built on the terminals of the Internet of things. Moreover, the regeneration coding is utilized to further improve the reliability of data storage in blockchains. 3) Our scheme provides a mechanism for periodically validating hash values of data to ensure the integrity of data stored in global blockchain.

TI Mine the gap: Bitcoin and the maintenance of trustlessness
SO NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB Subscribing to a techno-utopian discourse replacing institutions and experts with "trust in code," digital alternative currency Bitcoin is pitched as a "math-based money" governed by incorruptible code rather than human regulators. In three cases, which occurred between 2013 and 2015, we examine this system at moments of breakdown. In contrast to the discourse, we find that power is concentrated to critical sites and individuals who manage the system through ad hoc negotiations, and who users must therefore implicitly trust-a contrast we call Bitcoin's "promissory gap." But even in the face of such contradictions between premise and reality, the discourse is maintained. We identify four authorizing strategies used in this work: conflating people with devices, assuming actors conform to notions of economic rationality, appealing to technical expertise, and explaining contradictions as temporary bugs. We contend that these strategies are mobilized widely to legitimize a variety of applications of algorithmic regulation and peer production projects.

SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS AND TUTORIALS
AB Blockchain, as the underlying technology of crypto-currencies, has attracted significant attention. It has been adopted in numerous applications, such as smart grid and Internet-of-Things. However, there is a significant scalability barrier for blockchain, which limits its ability to support services with frequent transactions. On the other side, edge computing is introduced to extend the cloud resources and services to be distributed at the edge of the network, but currently faces challenges in its decentralized management and security. The integration of blockchain and edge computing into one system can enable reliable access and control of the network, storage, and computation distributed at the edges, hence providing a large scale of network servers, data storage, and validity computation near the end in a secure manner. Despite the prospect of integrated blockchain and edge computing systems, its scalability enhancement, self organization, functions integration, resource management, and new security issues remain to be addressed before widespread deployment. In this survey, we investigate some of the work that has been done to enable the integrated blockchain and edge computing system and discuss the research challenges. We identify several vital aspects of the integration of blockchain and edge computing: motivations, frameworks, enabling functionalities, and challenges. Finally, some broader perspectives are explored.

AB The recent emergence and use growth of cryptocurrencies based on Blockchain technology increased interest in the study of its economic dynamics and financial characteristics. Bitcoin is up to now the more widely known and disseminated cryptocurrency, with greater volume of transactions, market value and acceptance in exchange services. In order to contribute to the comprehension of the price behavior of the Bitcoin market, this study analyzes whether the historical series of prices of this currency, quoted every 12 h from September 14, 2011 to November 20, 2017 has multifractal behavior. The results of the research identified multifractal characteristics in the series and that both long-range correlations and fat tails distribution contribute to Bitcoin's multifractal behavior. We compared the non-Gaussian properties and the multifractality degrees of Bitcoin series with the non-Gaussian properties and multifractality degrees of several stock market indices scattered around the world. In addition, we investigated the power of multifractal analysis in the study of volatility and forecast for this series, pointing to a possible use of multifractal parameters in Technical Analysis.

TI Blockchain and smart contracts: the missing link in copyright licensing?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB This article offers a normative analysis of key blockchain technology concepts from the perspective of copyright law. Some features of blockchain technologies-scarcity, trust, transparency, decentralized public records and smart contracts-seem to make this technology compatible with the fundamentals of copyright. Authors can publish works on blockchain creating a quasi-immutable record of initial ownership, and encode 'smart' contracts to license the use of works. Remuneration may happen on online distribution platforms where the smart contracts reside. In theory, such an automated setup allows for the private ordering of copyright. Blockchain technology, like Digital Rights Management 20 years ago, is thus presented as an opportunity to reduce market friction, and increase both licensing efficiency and the autonomy of creators. Yet, some of the old problems remain. The article examines the differences between new, smart-contract-based private ordering regime and the fundamental components of copyright law, such as exceptions and limitations, the doctrine of exhaustion, restrictions on formalities, the public domain and fair remuneration.

Analysing these records shows that (i) current research on FinTech is fragmented with limited theoretical grounding; (ii) crowdfunding and blockchain can be regarded as two innovations that may disrupt traditional financial intermediation but in different ways; (iii) crowdfunding platforms substitute for traditional financial intermediaries and serve as a new intermediary, without eliminating the need for intermediation; (iv) similar to crowdfunding, blockchain also creates new intermediaries; and (v) the trust element inherent in blockchain enables blockchain to eliminate the need for intermediaries in some financial areas but not all.

TI Hybrid Blockchain and Internet-of-Things Network for Underground

SO SENSORS
AB The Internet-of-things (IoT) and blockchain are growing realities of modern society, and both are rapidly transforming civilization, either separately or in combination. However, the leverage of both technologies for structural health monitoring (SHM) to enable transparent information sharing among involved parties and autonomous decision making has not yet been achieved. Therefore, this study combines IoT with blockchain-based smart contracts for SHM of underground structures to define a novel, efficient, scalable, and secure distributed network for enhancing operational safety. In this blockchain-IoT network, the characteristics of locally centralized and globally decentralized distribution have been activated by dividing them into core and edge networks. This division enhances the efficiency and scalability of the system. The proposed system was effective in simulation for autonomous monitoring and control of structures. After proper design, the decentralized blockchain networks may effectively be deployed for transparent and efficient information sharing, smart contracts-based autonomous decision making, and data security in SHM.

TI Applications of Blockchain Technology to Logistics Management in
   Integrated Casinos and Entertainment
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB The gaming industry has evolved into a multi-functional smart city that combines integrated casinos and entertainment (ICE). ICE logistics involve supply chains with various stages in geographically-distributed locations and with limited and complex storage and warehouses. Challenges are to leverage demands, traffic, and storage allocation in ICE logistics. The decentralized structure of blockchain technology allows all parties to participate in ICE logistics. Its cryptography-based, immutable nature gives the assurance of security. This research deals with the design and application of blockchains in ICE logistics. We first adopt a Concentric Value Circles (CVC) model to identify the requirements and business opportunities that use blockchain technology in ICE logistics. We develop an open, automated, and transparent platform, TransICE, which utilizes the feature of smart contracts in blockchain technology and adopts a decentralized model, Hawk, where no financial transactions are stored on the blockchain to hold privacy of transactions publicly. Two cases, (1) the Shipment Pricing and Scheduling process and (2) the Pickup, Shipping and Delivery process in TransICE, are studied to illustrate the applications and feasibility of the proposed TransICE platform and the developed smart contracts of the Hawk model.

TI SoftEdgeNet: SDN Based Energy-Efficient Distributed Network Architecture
   For Edge Computing
SO IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB The volume of data traffic has increased exponentially due to the explosive growth of loT devices and the arrival of many new loT applications. Due to the large volume of data generated from loT devices, limited bandwidth, high latency, and real-time analysis requirements, the conventional centralized network architecture cannot meet users' requirements. Intensive real-time data analysis is one of the major challenges in current state-of-the-art centralized architectures due to the ubiquitous deployment of different types of sensors. To address the current challenges and adhere to the principles of architectural design, we are proposing a SoftEdgeNet model, which is a novel SDN-based distributed layered network architecture with a blockchain technique for a sustainable edge computing network. At the fog layer, we introduce an SDN-based secure fog node architecture to mitigate security attacks and provide real-time analytics services. We are also proposing a flow rule partition, and allocation algorithm at the edge of the network. The evaluation result shows our proposed model allows for a significant improvement of the interactions in real time data transmission. In terms of the ability to mitigate flooding attacks, the bandwidth is maintained above 9 Mb/s until the attack rates exceed 2000 PPS in the hardware environment and the bandwidth remained almost unchanged in the software environment. In the case of scalability of the proposed model, our proposed algorithm has performed better and proceeded linearly with the increase in traffic volume.

TI Are There Any Volatility Spill-Over Effects among Cryptocurrencies and
   Widely Traded Asset Classes?
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB In the present paper, we investigate connectedness within cryptocurrency markets as well as across the Bitcoin index (hereafter, BPI) and widely traded asset classes such as traditional currencies, stock market indices and commodities, such as gold and Brent oil. A spill over index approach with the spectral representation of variance decomposition networks, is employed to measure connectedness. Results show no significant spillover effects between the nascent market of cryptocurrencies and other financial markets. We suggest that cryptocurrencies are real independent financial instruments that pose no danger to financial system stability. Concerning the connectedness within the cryptocurrency markets, we report a time-frequency-dynamics connectedness nature. Moreover, the decomposition of the total spill over index is mostly dominated by a short frequency component (2-4 days) leading to the conclusion that this nascent market is highly speculative at present. These findings provide insights for regulators and potential international investors.

SO SENSORS
AB The Internet of Things aims at connecting everything, ranging from individuals, organizations, and companies to things in the physical and virtual world. The digital identity has always been considered as the keystone for all online services and the foundation for building security mechanisms such as authentication and authorization. However, the current literature still lacks a comprehensive study on the digital identity management for the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we firstly identify the requirements of building identity management systems for IoT, which comprises scalability, interoperability, mobility, security and privacy. Then, we trace the identity problem back to the origin in philosophy, analyze the Internet digital identity management solutions in the context of IoT and investigate recent surging blockchain sovereign identity solutions. Finally, we point out the promising future research trends in building IoT identity management systems and elaborate challenges of building a complete identity management system for the IoT, including access control, privacy preserving, trust and performance respectively.

TI On the economic significance of ransomware campaigns: A Bitcoin
   transactions perspective
SO COMPUTERS & SECURITY
AB Bitcoin cryptocurrency system enables users to transact securely and pseudo-anonymously by using an arbitrary number of aliases (Bitcoin addresses). Cybercriminals exploit these characteristics to commit immutable and presumably untraceable monetary fraud, especially via ransomware; a type of malware that encrypts files of the infected system and demands ransom for decryption. In this paper, we present our comprehensive study on all recent ransomware and report the economic impact of such ransomware from the Bitcoin payment perspective. We also present a lightweight framework to identify, collect, and analyze Bitcoin addresses managed by the same user or group of users (cybercriminals, in this case), which includes a novel approach for classifying a payment as ransom. To verify the correctness of our framework, we compared our findings on CryptoLocker ransomware with the results presented in the literature. Our results align with the results found in the previous works except for the final valuation in USD. The reason for this discrepancy is that we used the average Bitcoin price on the day of each ransom payment whereas the authors of the previous studies used the Bitcoin price on the day of their evaluation. Furthermore, for each investigated ransomware, we provide a holistic view of its genesis, development, the process of infection and execution, and characteristic of ransom demands. Finally, we also release our dataset that contains a detailed transaction history of all the Bitcoin addresses we identified for each ransomware. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI New spaces of disruption? The failures of Bitcoin and the rhetorical
   power of algorithmic governance
SO GEOFORUM
AB In less than a decade Bitcoin and the technology of blockchain a cryptographically-secured, algorithmically regulated, distributed-ledger emerged as the enfant terrible of the global economy. Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain.

TI Analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain: socio-economic factors behind the
   adoption
SO EPJ DATA SCIENCE
AB As the first decentralized digital currency introduced in 2009 together with the blockchain, Bitcoin offers new opportunities both for developed and developing countries. Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in JDigit Bank 2(4):311-337, 2018).However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption.In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries. In a nutshell our study provides a new insight on Bitcoin adoption by country and on the potential socio-economic drivers of the international Bitcoin flow.

TI Scalable Dynamic Multi-Agent Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant
   Consensus in Permissioned Blockchain
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The permissioned blockchain system has recently become popular in a wide range of scenarios, such as artificial intelligence, financial applications and the Internet of things, due to its dominance in terms of distribution, decentralization, reliability and security. However, the Practical Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (PBFT) algorithm, which is currently adopted in such systems, sparks communication bottlenecks when the number of consensus nodes increases sharply, which seriously hinders large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose a scalable dynamic multi-agent hierarchical PBFT algorithm (SDMA-PBFT), which reduces the communication costs from O(n(2)) to O(n x k x log(k)(n)). Specifically, SDMA-PBFT forms multiple autonomous systems at each agent node in which message multicasting can be efficiently carried out and the internal voting results can be effectively collected. Therefore, the design of these agent nodes facilitates the in-and-out operations of consensus nodes in the blockchain system. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm substantially outperforms the PBFT algorithm in terms of latency. Hence, it can be applied to the permissioned blockchain system effectively and efficiently.

TI Collective behavior of cryptocurrency price changes
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Digital assets termed cryptocurrencies are correlated. We analyze cross correlations between price changes of different cryptocurrencies using methods of random matrix theory and minimum spanning trees. We find that the cross correlation matrix exhibits non-trivial hierarchical structures and groupings of cryptocurrency pairs, which are not present in the partial cross correlations. In sharp contrast to the predictions for other financial markets, we discover that most of the eigenvalues in the spectrum of the cross correlation matrix do not agree with the universal predictions of random matrix theory, but the few of the largest eigenvalues deviate as expected. The minimum spanning tree of cryptocurrency cross correlations reveals distinct community structures that are surprisingly stable. Collective behaviors that are present in the cryptocurrency market can be useful for the construction of portfolio of cryptocurrencies as well as for future research on the subject.

TI Can Bitcoin Replace Gold in an Investment Portfolio?
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
AB Bitcoin is an exciting new financial product that may be useful for inclusion in investment portfolios. This paper investigates the implications of replacing gold in an investment portfolio with bitcoin (digital gold). Our approach is to use several different multivariate GARCH models (dynamic conditional correlation (DCC), asymmetric DCC (ADCC), generalized orthogonal GARCH (GO-GARCH)) to estimate minimum variance equity portfolios. Both long and short portfolios are considered. An analysis of the economic value shows that risk-averse investors will be willing to pay a high performance fee to switch from a portfolio with gold to a portfolio with bitcoin. These results are robust to the inclusion of trading costs.

TI A Demonstration of Sterling: A Privacy-Preserving Data Marketplace
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB In this work, we demonstrate Sterling, a decentralized marketplace for private data. Sterling enables privacy-preserving distribution and use of data by using privacy-preserving smart contracts which run on a permissionless blockchain. The privacy-preserving smart contracts, written by data providers and consumers, immutably and irrevocably represent the interests of their creators. In particular, we provide a mechanism for data providers to control the use of their data through automatic verification of data consumer contracts, allowing providers to express constraints such as pricing and differential privacy. Through smart contracts and trusted execution environments, Sterling enables privacy-preserving analytics and machine learning over private data in an efficient manner. The resulting economy ensures that the interests of all parties are aligned.
   For the demonstration, we highlight the use of Sterling for training machine learning models on individuals' health data. In doing so, we showcase novel approaches to automatically appraising training data, verifying and enforcing model privacy properties, and efficiently training private models on the blockchain using trusted hardware.

SO SCIENTIFIC ANNALS OF ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS
AB This paper investigates the information transmission between the most important cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. We use a VAR modelling approach, upon which the Geweke's feedback measures and generalized impulse response functions are computed. This methodology allows us to fully characterize the direction, intensity and persistence of information flows between cryptocurrencies. At this data granularity, most of information transmission is contemporaneous. However, it seems that there are some lagged feedback effects, mainly from other cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin. The generalized impulse-response functions confirm that there is a strong contemporaneous correlation and that there is not much evidence of lagged effects. The exception appears to be related to the overreaction of Bitcoin returns to contemporaneous shocks.

AB Cyber-physical systems (CPS), robotics, Internet of Things, information and communication technologies have become more and more popular over the last several years. These topics open new perspectives and scenarios that can automate processes in human life. CPS are aimed at interaction support in information space for physical entities communicated in physical space in real time. At the same time the blockchain technology that becomes popular last years allows to organize immutable distributed database that store all significant information and provide access for CPS participants. The paper proposes an approach that is based on ontology-based context management, publish/subscribe semantic interoperability support, and blockchain techniques. Utilization of these techniques provide possibilities to develop CPS that supports dynamic, distributed, and stable coalition formation of the resources. The case study presented has been implemented for the scenario of heterogeneous mobile robots' collaboration for the overcoming of obstacles. There are two types of robots and an information service participating in the scenario. Evaluation shows that the proposed approach is applicable for the presented class of scenarios.

TI A Hardware-Based Caching System on FPGA NIC for Blockchain
SO IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS
AB Engineers and researchers have recently paid attention to Blockchain. Blockchain is a fault-tolerant distributed ledger without administrators. Blockchain is originally derived from cryptocurrency, but it is possible to be applied to other industries. Transferring digital asset is called a transaction. Blockchain holds all transactions, so the total amount of Blockchain data will increase as time proceeds. On the other hand, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) products has been increasing. It is difficult for IoT products to hold all Blockchain data because of their storage capacity. Therefore, they access Blockchain data via servers that have Blockchain data. However, if a lot of IoT products access Blockchain network via servers, server overloads will occur. Thus, it is useful to reduce workloads and improve throughput. In this paper, we propose a caching technique using a Field Programmable Gate Array-based (FPGA) Network Interface Card (NIC) which possesses four 10Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) interfaces. The proposed system can reduce server overloads, because the FPGA NIC instead of the server responds to requests from IoT products if cache hits. We implemented the proposed hardware cache to achieve high throughput on NetFPGA-10G board. We counted the number of requests that the server or the FPGA NIC processed as an evaluation. As a result, the throughput improved by on average 1.97 times when hitting the cache.

TI ShadowEth: Private Smart Contract on Public Blockchain
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Blockchain is becoming popular as a distributed and reliable ledger which allows distrustful parties to transact safely without trusting third parties. Emerging blockchain systems like Ethereum support smart contracts where miners can run arbitrary user-defined programs. However, one of the biggest concerns about the blockchain and the smart contract is privacy, since all the transactions on the chain are exposed to the public. In this paper, we present ShadowEth, a system that leverages hardware enclave to ensure the confidentiality of smart contracts while keeping the integrity and availability based on existing public blockchains like Ethereum. ShadowEth establishes a confidential and secure platform protected by trusted execution environment (TEE) off the public blockchain for the execution and storage of private contracts. It only puts the process of verification on the blockchain. We provide a design of our system including a protocol of the cryptographic communication and verification and show the applicability and feasibility of ShadowEth by various case studies. We implement a prototype using the Intel SGX on the Ethereum network and analyze the security and availability of the system.

Yet, the business process for the Less Container Load (LCL) transport industry in most ports of China still remain complicated and inefficient. In this article, the authors see numerous opportunities for process improvement by integrating the information among the various actors using the blockchain concept. In this paper, the authors propose to build a LCL Export Platform (LEP) using the blockchain concept to optimize the LCL operations for international trading, by integrating and sharing information among forwarder agencies and their clients.

TI Is Bitcoin Intrinsically Worthless?
SO JOURNAL OF PRIVATE ENTERPRISE
AB Monies are typically categorized as commodity or fiat, depending on whether the money in question is intrinsically worthless. In the case of bitcoin, its category is not clear. I consider the superficial subjective value argument often put forward by nonmonetary economists and a more sophisticated payments technology argument. After dismissing both, I argue that there are two reasonable views on the value of bitcoin. One might claim bitcoin lacks intrinsic worth, in which case its value depends on foresight and coordination. Alternatively, one might claim that bitcoin has intrinsic worth, even if no one else accepts it, because some users have peculiar preferences. In either case, bitcoin's existence calls into question the practical relevance of the regression theorem.

AB Smart contracts can automatically perform the contract terms according to the received information, and it is one of the most important research fields in digital society. The core of smart contracts is algorithm contract, that is, the parties reach an agreement on the contents of the contract and perform the contracts according to the behaviors written in certain computer algorithms. It not only needs to make sure about the correctness of smart contracts code, but also should provide a credible contract code execution environment. Blockchain provides a trusted execution and storage environment for smart contracts by the distributed secure storage, consistency verification and encryption technology. Current challenge is how to assure that smart contract can be executed as the parties' willingness. This paper introduces formal modeling and verification in formal methods to make smart contract model and verify the properties of smart contracts. Formal methods combined with smart contracts aim to reduce the potential errors and cost during contract development process. The description of a general and formal smart contract template is provided. The tool of model checking, SPIN, is used to verify the correctness and necessary properties for a smart contract template. The research shows model checking will be useful and necessary for smart contracts.

AB We characterize various currencies according to their control structure, focusing on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and government-issued fiat money. We then argue that there is a large unmet demand for a liquid asset that allows households and firms to save outside of the private financial sector. Central banks could offer such an asset by simply allowing households and firms to open accounts with them. Finally, we conclude that a central bank will not issue cryptocurrencies in the sense of a truly decentralized and permissionless asset that allows users to remain anonymous.

TI 'Algorithmic nations': seeing like a city-regional and techno-political
   conceptual assemblage
SO REGIONAL STUDIES REGIONAL SCIENCE
AB There are changing dynamics among political regionalization processes and the rescaling of nation-states in Europe. However, updated and timely research remains scant, ambiguous and unable to meet the challenges of data-driven societies and uneven borders. Nations' physical boundaries matter as much as political borders in their pervasive and growing algorithmic, stateless, liquid and metropolitan citizenship patterns. This paper explores these new 'connectographies' from a regional science perspective, introducing the term 'algorithmic nations' as a city-regional and techno-political conceptual assemblage. A case study is presented of the small stateless city-regionalized European nation of the Basque Country through its analytical and transitional lens, locally known as 'Euskal Hiria' (Basque city-region in the Basque language). This paper questions whether the Basque Country could evolve by (1) modifying its governmental logics and (2) merging its three separate devolved administrations (3) while enabling their direct interactions with citizens (4) through blockchain technologies as the small state of Estonia is implementing and employing cutting-edge algorithmic governance frameworks. In doing so, this paper suggests how four drivers - metropolitanization, devolution, the right to decide and blockchain - may be respectively invigorating four dynamics - geoeconomics, geopolitics, geodemocratics and geotechnologics - in this transition towards the algorithmic nations. Ultimately, this paper concludes with an algorithmic nations research and policy agenda decalogue of how these geotechnological changes might determine the future position of small stateless city-regionalized nations in the European Union.

AB The expansion of blockchain technologies from financial applications to other fields intensifies the problem of an increasing size of data stored in the blockchain. Unfortunately, new participants of the blockchain network are required to download the whole blockchain to gain an overview about the state of the system and to validate incoming transactions. Approaches like IOTA, SegWit or the Lightning Network try to solve the scalability issues of blockchain applications. Unfortunately, they focus on strategies slowing down the blockchain's growth instead of reducing the problems arising from a growing chain or introduce new concepts to oust the linear blockchain altogether. The approach proposed in this paper is based on the idea of Ethereum to keep the state of the system explicitly in the current block but further pursues this by including the relevant part of the current system state in new transactions as well. This enables other participants to validate incoming transactions without having to download the whole blockchain initially. Following this idea use cases can be supported that require scalable blockchain technology but not necessarily an indefinite and complete transaction history.

AB We discuss the problem of constructing efficient temporal indexes on Hyperledger Fabric, a popular Blockchain platform. The temporal nature of the data inserted by Fabric transactions can be leveraged to support various use-cases. This requires that temporal queries be processed efficiently on this data. Currently this presents significant challenges as this data is organized on file-system, is exposed via limited API and does not support temporal indexes.
   In a prior work [1], we presented two models for creating temporal indexes on Fabric which overcome these limitations and improve the performance of temporal queries on Fabric. The first model creates a copy of each event inserted and stores temporally close events together on Fabric. The second model keeps the event count intact but tags metadata to each event s.t. temporally close events share the same metadata.
   In this paper, we present variants on these two models which are better able to handle the skew present in Fabric data. We discuss the details and show that these variants significantly outperform the approaches presented in [1] when Fabric data contains skew. We also discuss the performance tradeoffs among these variants across various dimensions - data storage, query performance, event insertion time etc.

AB Initial Cryptoasset Offering (ICO), also often called Initial Coin Offering or Initial Token Offering (ITO) is a new means of fundraising through blockchain technology, which allows startups to raise large amounts of funds from the crowd in an unprecedented speed. However it is not easy for ordinary investors to distinguish genuine fundraising activities through ICOs from scams. Different websites that gather and evaluate ICOs at different stages have emerged as a solution to this issue. What remains unclear is how these websites are evaluating ICOs, and consequently how reliable and credible their evaluations are. In this paper we present the first findings of an analysis of a set of 28 ICO evaluation websites, aiming at revealing the state of the practice in terms of ICO evaluation. Key information about ICOs collected by these websites are categorised, and key factors that differentiate the evaluation mechanisms employed by these evaluation websites are identified. The findings of our study could help a better understanding of what entails to properly evaluate ICOs. It is also a first step towards discovering the key success factors of ICOs.

AB An atomic cross-chain swap is a distributed coordination task where multiple parties exchange assets across multiple blockchains, for example, trading bitcoin for ether.
   An atomic swap protocol guarantees (1) if all parties conform to the protocol, then all swaps take place, (2) if some coalition deviates from the protocol, then no conforming party ends up worse off, and (3) no coalition has an incentive to deviate from the protocol. A cross-chain swap is modeled as a directed graph D, whose vertexes are parties and whose arcs are proposed asset transfers. For any pair (D, L), where D = (V, A) is a strongly-connected directed graph and L subset of V a feedback vertex set for D, we give an atomic cross-chain swap protocol for D, using a form of hashed timelock contracts, where the vertexes in L generate the hashlocked secrets. We show that no such protocol is possible if D is not strongly connected, or if D is strongly connected but L is not a feedback vertex set. The protocol has time complexity O(diam(D)) and space complexity (bits stored on all blockchains) O(vertical bar A vertical bar(2)).

TI A Blockchain-Based Notarization Service for Biomedical Knowledge
   Retrieval
SO COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB Biomedical research and clinical decision depend increasingly on scientific evidence realized by a number of authoritative databases, mostly public and continually enriched via peer scientific contributions. Given the dynamic nature of biomedical evidence data and their usage in the sensitive domain of biomedical science, it is important to ensure retrieved data integrity and non-repudiation. In this work, we present a blockchain-based notarization service that uses smart digital contracts to seal a biomedical database query and the respective results. The goal is to ensure that retrieved data cannot be modified after retrieval and that the database cannot validly deny that the particular data has been provided as a result of a specific query. Biomedical evidence data versioning is also supported. The feasibility of the proposed notarization approach is demonstrated using a real blockchain infrastructure and is tested on two different biomedical evidence databases: a publicly available medical risk factor reference repository and on the PubMed database of biomedical literature references and abstracts.

AB There is no doubt that the revolutionary concept of the blockchain, which is the underlying technology behind the famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin and its successors, is triggering the start of a new era in the Internet and the online services. While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies; in fact, many administrative operations, fintech procedures, and everyday services that can only be done offline and/or in person, can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services. What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts, as in the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. E-voting on the other hand, is another trending, yet critical, topic related to the online services. The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use e-voting systems. Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable ones, due to its consistency, widespread use, and provision of smart contracts logic. An e-voting system must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees. In this work, we have implemented and tested a sample e-voting application as a smart contract for the Ethereum network using the Ethereum wallets and the Solidity language. Android platform is also considered to allow voting for people who do not have an Ethereum wallet. After an election is held, eventually, the Ethereum blockchain will hold the records of ballots and votes. Users can submit their votes via an Android device or directly from their Ethereum wallets, and these transaction requests are handled with the consensus of every single Ethereum node. This consensus creates a transparent environment for e-voting. In addition to a broad discussion about reliability and efficiency of the blockchain-based e-voting systems, our application and its test results are presented in this paper, too.

AB Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin not only provide a decentralized currency, but also provide a programmatic way to process transactions. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency next to Bitcoin, is the first to provide a Turing-complete language to specify transaction processing, thereby enabling so-called smart contracts. This provides an opportune setting for attackers, as security vulnerabilities are tightly intertwined with financial gain. In this paper, we consider the problem of automatic vulnerability identification and exploit generation for smart contracts. We develop a generic definition of vulnerable contracts and use this to build TEETHER, a tool that allows creating an exploit for a contract given only its binary bytecode. We perform a large-scale analysis of all 38,757 unique Ethereum contracts, 815 out of which our tool finds working exploits for-completely automated.

TI Synergistic Effect of Binary Mixed-Pluronic Systems on Temperature
   Dependent Self-assembly Process and Drug Solubility
SO POLYMERS
AB Mixed Pluronic micelles from very hydrophobic and very hydrophilic copolymers were selected to scrutinize the synergistic effect on the self-assembly process as well as the solubilization capacity of ibuprofen. The tendency of mixing behavior between parent copolymers was systematically examined from two perspectives: different block chain lengths at same hydrophilicity (L92 + F108, + F98, + F88, and + F68), as well as various hydrophobicities at the same PPO moiety (L92 + F88, + F87, and + P84). Temperature-dependent micellization in these binary systems was clearly inspected by the combined use of high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter (HSDSC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Changes in heat capacity and size of aggregates at different temperatures during the whole micellization process were simultaneously observed and examined. While distinction of block chain length between parent copolymers increases, the monodispersity of the binary Pluronic systems decreases. However, parent copolymers with distinct PPO moieties do not affirmatively lead to non-cooperative binding, such as the L92 + P84 system. The addition of ibuprofen promotes micellization as well as stabilizes aggregates in the solution. The partial replacement of the hydrophilic Pluronic by a more hydrophobic Pluronic L92 would increase the total hydrophobicity of mixed Pluronics used in the system to substantially enhance the solubility of ibuprofen. The solubility of ibuprofen in the 0.5 wt % L92 + 0.368 wt % P84 system is as high as 4.29 mg/mL, which is 1.4 times more than that of the 0.868 wt % P84 system and 147 times more than that in pure water at 37 degrees C.

The distributed mechanism, decentralized mechanism, password mechanism and scripted mechanism of the Blockchain present a completely new perspective for the development of Internet information security technology. The Blockchain technology redefines the storage and dissemination methods of the information in the network. Neither participant needs to know each other, and nor does it require third-party certification bodies to participate. It records, transmits and stores transferring activities of the information value by distributed technology, ensures that data is not tampered and forged based on an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, enables all participants reached a consensus on the status of blockchain data information. And from the current industry research on blockchain technology, it expounds the application of blockchain technology in identity authentication, data protection and network security. The Blockchain technology will be a great driving force in the process of information security technology change, and will have a far-reaching impact on the expansion of information security.

AB Blockchain is a new technology for data sharing between untrusted peers. However, it does not work well with massive transactions. Besides, there are high barriers between heterogeneous blockchain systems. In this paper, we proposed an innovative component-based framework for exchanging information across arbitrary blockchain system called interactive multiple blockchain architecture. In our architecture, a dynamic network of multi-chain is created for inter-blockchain communication. We propose the inter-blockchain connection model for routing management and messages transferring. Additionally, our proposed protocols provide transactions with atomicity and consistency in crossing-chain scene. In the end, our experiment results based on a network of private multiple blockchain systems show that the throughput is increased by a number of chains parallel running.

AB The block chain has achieved great success in bit coin, and its decentralization idea caught highly attention of financial institutions, capital markets and academia. Decentralization is the most fundamental feature of the block chain, but decentralization sacrifices efficiency, while mining leads to high bit coin transaction costs; in some industries, such as the commercial retail, high efficiency and low cost are required. The consensus algorithm is the core technology to achieve non-centralization. This article proposes a DPoS consensus mechanism election algorithm. This algorithm improves the ring-based coordinator election algorithm. First, the algorithm is used to elect the agents, and then the final winner, reach a new consensus, meet the requirements of the block chain performance in the commercial retail sector, reduce transaction costs, and construct a fair, freely competitive, non-monopoly, secure and non-centralized block chain platform.

AB In the past few years, cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications has been one of the most rapidly emerging fields of computer science, leading to a strong demand of software applications. Several new projects have been emerging almost daily, with an impetus that was not seen since the days of the dawn of the Internet. However, the need of being timely on the market and the lack of experience in a brand new field led to epic disasters, such as those of DAO in 2016 and of Parity Ethereum wallet in 2017. Also, there have been several hacks successfully performed on cryptocurrency exchanges, the biggest being those of MtGox in 2014 (350 million US$), Bitfinex in 2016 (72 million US$), and Coincheck in 2017 (400 million US$). The application of sound SE practices to Blockchain software development, both for Smart Contract and generic Blockchain software, might be crucial to the success of this new field. Here the issues are the need for specific analysis and design methods, quality control through testing and metrics, security assessment and overall development process. At the same time, Blockchain development offers new opportunities, such as the certification of empirical data used for experiment; the ability to design processes where developers are paid upon completion of their tasks through Blockchain tokens, after acceptance tests performed using Smart Contracts; and more sound techniques enabling pay-per-use software, again using tokens.

AB Smart contracts-stateful executable objects hosted on blockchains like Ethereum-carry billions of dollars worth of coins and cannot be updated once deployed. We present a new systematic characterization of a class of trace vulnerabilities, which result from analyzing multiple invocations of a contract over its lifetime. We focus attention on three example properties of such trace vulnerabilities: finding contracts that either lock funds indefinitely, leak them carelessly to arbitrary users, or can be killed by anyone. We implemented Maian, the first tool for specifying and reasoning about trace properties, which employs inter-procedural symbolic analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts flags 34, 200 (2, 365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10 seconds per contract. On a subset of 3, 759 contracts which we sampled for concrete validation and manual analysis, we reproduce real exploits at a true positive rate of 89%, yielding exploits for 3, 686 contracts. Our tool finds exploits for the infamous Parity bug that indirectly locked $200 million US worth in Ether, which previous analyses failed to capture.

AB In this paper, we present a formal verification tool for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode. To precisely reason about all possible behaviors of the EVM bytecode, we adopted KEVM, a complete formal semantics of the EVM, and instantiated the K-framework's reachability logic theorem prover to generate a correct-by-construction deductive verifier for the EVM. We further optimized the verifier by introducing EVM-specific abstractions and lemmas to improve its scalability. Our EVM verifier has been used to verify various high-profile smart contracts including the ERC20 token, Ethereum Casper, and DappHub MakerDAO contracts.

AB Nowadays, in order to support flexibility, agility, and ubiquitous accessibility among vehicles, software defined networking has been proposed to integrate with vehicular networks, known as software defined vehicular network (SDVN). Due to a variety of data, flows, and vehicles in SDVN, a distributed SDVN is necessary. However, how to reach consensus in distributed SDVN efficiently and safely is an intractable problem. In this paper, we use a permissioned blockchain approach to reach consensus in distributed SDVN. The existing permissioned blockchain has a number of drawbacks, such as low throughput. We virtualize the underlying resources (e.g., computing resources and networking resources), jointly considering the trust features of blockchain nodes to improve the throughput. Accordingly, we formulate view change, computing resources allocation, and networking resources allocation as a joint optimization problem. In order to solve this joint problem, we use a novel deep Q-learning approach. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.

TI Blockchain Based Credibility Verification Method for IoT Entities
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB With the fast development of mobile Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) has been found in many important applications recently. However, it still faces many challenges in security and privacy. Blockchain (BC) technology, which underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has played an important role in the development of decentralized and data intensive applications running on millions of devices. In this paper, to establish the relationship between IoT and BC for device credibility verification, we propose a framework with layers, intersect, and self-organization Blockchain Structures (BCS). In this new framework, each BCS is organized by Blockchain technology. We describe the credibility verification method and show how it provide the verification. The efficiency and security analysis are also given in this paper, including its response time, storage efficiency, and verification. The conducted experiments have been shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in satisfying the credible requirement achieved by Blockchain technology and certain advantages in storage space and response time.

AB Internet of Things, cognitive systems, and blockchain technology are three fields which have created numerous revolutions in software development. It seems that a combination among these fields may results in emerging a high potential and interesting field. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain technology. To the best of our knowledge, there is no framework for Internet of Things based on cognitive systems and blockchain. In order to study the applicability of the proposed framework, a recommender system based on the proposed framework is suggested. Since the proposed framework is novel, the suggested recommender system is novel. The suggested recommender system is compared with the existing recommender systems. The results show that the suggested recommender system has several benefits which are not available in the existing recommender systems.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is now in its initial stage but very soon, it is going to influence almost every day-to-day items we use. The more it will be included in our lifestyle, more will be the threat of it being misused. There is an urgent need to make IoT devices secure from getting cracked. Very soon IoT is going to expand the area for the cyber-attacks on homes and businesses by transforming objects that were used to be offline into online systems. Existing security technologies are just not enough to deal with this problem. Blockchain has emerged as the possible solution for creating more secure IoT systems in the time to come. In this paper, first an overview of the blockchain technology and its implementation has been explained; then we have discussed the infrastructure of IoT which is based on Blockchain network and at last a model has been provided for the security of internet of things using blockchain.

AB The Intelligent vehicle is experiencing revolutionary growth in research and industry, but it still suffers from a lot of security vulnerabilities. Traditional security methods are incapable of providing secure IV, mainly in terms of communication. In IV communication, major issues are trust and data accuracy of received and broadcasted reliable data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works for the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin which has been recently used to build trust and reliability in peer-to-peer networks with similar topologies to IV Communication world. IV to IV, communicate in a decentralized manner within communication networks. In this paper, we have proposed, Trust Bit (TB) for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology. Our proposed trust bit provides surety for each IVs broadcasted data, to be secure and reliable in every particular networks. Our Trust Bit is a symbol of trustworthiness of vehicles behavior, and vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal also includes a reward system, which can exchange some TB among IVs, during successful communication. For the data management of this trust bit, we have used blockchain technology in the vehicular cloud, which can store all Trust bit details and can be accessed by IV anywhere and anytime. Our proposal provides secure and reliable information. We evaluate our proposal with the help of IV communication on intersection use case which analyzes a variety of trustworthiness between IVs during communication.

Cloud storage like any other untrusted environment needs the ability to secure share information. Our approach provides an access control over the data stored in the cloud without the provider participation. The main tool of access control mechanism is ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption scheme with dynamic attributes. Using a blockchain-based decentralized ledger, our system provides immutable log of all meaningful security events, such as key generation, access policy assignment, change or revocation, access request. We propose a set of cryptographic protocols ensuring privacy of cryptographic operations requiring secret or private keys. Only ciphertexts of hash codes are transferred through the blockchain ledger. The prototype of our system is implemented using smart contracts and tested on Ethereum blockchain platform.

TI Trust in a viable real estate economy with disruption and blockchain
SO FACILITIES
AB Purpose - The real estate world finds itself at a tipping point of a transition: a dramatic and irreversible shift in (real estate) systems in society. This paper is a State of the art of Disruption, Blockchain and Real Estate in the Netherlands and international.
   Design/methodology/approach - The following questions were asked to all those involved: What do you think is the essence of Blockchain for real estate? What is the most current situation with respect to Blockchain and real estate from your perspective? Which publications are important from your perspective? What do you expect with respect to the impact of Blockchain on real estate for (social) real estate? What are questions for the future for real estate and Blockchain? In addition, interviews, exploratory conversations and correspondence took place, and the content was peer reviewed.
   Findings - Changes in value concepts affect the valuation of real estate and the thinking about it. The orientation of changing users and owners of real estate affects innovativeness, values and flexibility in managing that property. Orientation on disruption must be seen as proof that the real estate world is able to actually innovate the accumulated assets and consolidate this. The financial and real estate markets are markets that exaggerate through irrational behaviour. Fear of "eat or be eaten" determines people's behaviour. Financial and thus real estate markets are always unstable and must always be regulated by people and organizations.
   Research limitations/implications - The question that remains is whether it is important to look at disruptive innovations in existing markets or newcomers in the real estate market and Blockchain. The question is whether Blockchain is only a technological disruption, or a real game changer, and whether the entire value chain of the real estate market will embrace it. No two disruptions are the same. Trust in Blockchain is a prerequisite for guiding the predictable form of that disruption where start-up companies use new technology to offer cheaper and inferior alternatives to real estate in the market. You could also talk about anti-fragile value: "Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile" (Taleb, 2012), in other words: attention to disruption and Blockchain creates a viable real estate economy.
   Practical implications - The true meaning of the Blockchain technology for real estate still needs to be investigated. The author is still curious to understand and clarify the value of Blockchain for real estate processes. Doubt continues to exist and is therefore a feeding ground for further research, because we do not know what we have not seen.
   Social implications - Looking at the impact of Blockchain on real estate, a number of conclusions can be drawn. First of all, the relationship between Blockchain and real estate has not yet been proven in practice. It is expected to develop further in the form of registering transaction processes and the DNA passport of a real estate object. Secondly, completeness and transparency are the basic ingredients for trust in the system. Third, real estate wants to remain viable. For this reason, taking the offense is necessary for real estate and management to connect with social demand. Behaviour also leads to new earnings models of the social and economic spin-off of disruptive real estate. If the Dutch real estate sector embraces Blockchain and is able to realize innovations, there are opportunities for real estate entrepreneurs to exploit the disruptive character to provide those new services.
   Originality/value - The way in which disruption, Blockchain and real estate will develop in the coming years are not the only obvious characteristics of a particular era but also its social impact and user behaviour. This also applies to how this real estate transition can best be tracked, guided and utilized in society at the international, national and regional level. Disruptive organizations clearly respond to the viability of the (built) environment and therefore determine competitive strength. This affects the current and future valuation of real estate.

TI Robot vs. tax inspector or how the fourth industrial revolution will
   change the tax system: a review of problems and solutions
SO JOURNAL OF TAX REFORM
AB The Fourth Industrial Revolution and the accelerated development of cyber-physical technologies lead to essential changes in national tax systems and international taxation. The main areas in which taxation meets cyber-physical technologies are digitalization, robotization, M2M and blockchain technologies. Each of these areas has its own opportunities and problems. Three main approaches towards possible solutions for these new problems are identified. The first is to try to apply taxation to new cyber-physical technologies and products of their application. This approach includes the OECD's Action 1 Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. It also includes the spread of traditional taxes on new objects - personal data, cryptocurrencies, imputed income of robots. The second is to replace digital transactions and shortfalls in revenues by traditional objects of taxation in the form of tangible assets and people and / or increase tax pressure (including by improving tax administration with use of Big Data) and the degree of progressiveness of taxes already levied on such objects. The third approach is to set a course on building a new tax space with smart taxes based on real-time principles, smart contracts and Big Data. This implies a transition to automatic taxation using blockchain technologies, which focus on the functions of applying distributed ledgers of business transactions in real-time. At present, the general trends are such that the first and second are prevalent, which is manifested in an increase in the relative importance of property, sales and employment taxes. Concerning the third approach, any movement in this direction is still facing a number of technical and other problems and is thus being discussed mainly at the conceptual level

TI Anonymity for Bitcoin From Secure Escrow Address
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Bitcoin is promoted as decentralized cryptocurrency by using pseudonym to achieve anonymity. Unfortunately, numerous seminal works have demonstrated that Bitcoin only offers weak anonymity in practice. Indeed, the practical technologies of clustering and flow analysis are much effective for tracing Bitcoin transaction and thereby revealing the owner involved. Otherwise said, user's privacy in Bitcoin has been sadly degenerated to be linkable. In this paper, we propose a completely decentralized scheme that can provide full anonymity in Bitcoin. The idea behind the output is to exploit a secure escrow address, which is consensual by all the involved users. The escrow address is generated from the trick of cryptographically secure distributed key generation and can then be used for mixing transactions in Bitcoin. Our protocol is secure against malicious adversaries. The users can jointly perform the protocol and successfully accomplish the transaction without the help of any (trusted) third party and no extra fees. Besides, our proposal is completely compatible with the current Bitcoin architecture.

TI A Regulation Scheme Based on the Ciphertext-Policy Hierarchical
   Attribute-Based Encryption in Bitcoin System
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In Bitcoin financial system, a user's privacy is supposed to be protected by means of anonymity. However, the anonymity makes illegal trades possible because nobody is able to reveal the real identities of the illegal users. In this paper, we propose a regulation scheme based on the ciphertext-policy hierarchical attribute-based encryption (CP-HABE). In the scheme, users' identities are encrypted by using access policy and are contained in their transaction. A type of user is defined as the dependable regulation node, which is responsible for the regulation of transactions and encrypted identities. A new signature algorithm instead of the elliptic curve signature is adopted to generate wallet key pairs, this establishes a connection between wallet addresses and encrypted identities. When a transaction is doubted to involve illegal activities, the authorized regulation nodes are capable of revealing the users' real identities and add the illegal identities to a public blacklist. Our system is based on a new CP-HABE scheme which is proved to be secure against chosen-plaintext attack in the standard model under the Bilinear Diffic-Hellman Exponent assumption. Finally, we give a performance analysis of our system. The proposed regulation system can reveal criminals' identities undertaking illegal activities.

TI Blockchain Architecture Reliability-Based Measurement for Circuit Unit
   Importance
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Currently, few works focus on the reliability of the blockchain architecture at the circuit level, which makes its security and privacy vulnerable to hardware errors. To mitigate the hazard, through an iterative probabilistic transfer matrix model coded by a binary-decimal mechanism, a reliability-based evaluation method for the importance of circuit units is proposed in this paper. First, the method calculates the output reliabilities in any leads by the iterative probabilistic transfer matrix model and obtains the reliability gradient for the circuit units based on the gradient and barrel theory. Second, it sorts the importance of the circuit units based on their obtained reliability gradients. Third, combining the sensitized path coverage rate and the sequence comparison, the method constructs an importance-based sorting algorithm for the circuit units with the same reliability gradients. Finally, it reinforces the importance circuit units based on the sorting results to improve the security and privacy for the blockchain architecture at the hardware level. Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can be applied to measure the importance of circuit units at several abstract levels, with high precision and small time-space complexity, and systems can thus achieve a great reliability improvement at a small cost.

TI Bitcoin as an alternative investment vehicle
SO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
AB This paper documents time series momentum in Bitcoin returns. The paper finds persistence in returns for one to 8 weeks that partially reverses over longer horizons, consistent with sentiment theories of initial under-reaction and delayed over-reaction. The time series momentum in Bitcoin returns is similar to that of the other asset returns while the time span is much shorter. This may be due to much quicker nature and shorter term memory of Bitcoin investors. A combined portfolio of S&P500 and Bitcoin momentum strategy shows enhanced expected return, skewness, kurtosis and Value at Risk for given levels of portfolio return volatility.

TI KYC Optimization Using Distributed Ledger Technology
SO BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING

CY DEC 11-14, 2016
CL Dublin, IRELAND
AB The know-your-customer (KYC) due diligence process is outdated and generates costs of up to USD 500 million per year per bank. The authors propose a new system, based on distributed ledger technology (DLT), that reduces the costs of the core KYC verification process for financial institutions and improves the customer experience. In the proposed system, the core KYC verification process is only conducted once for each customer, regardless of the number of financial institutions with which that customer intends to work. Thanks to DLT, the result of the core KYC verification can be securely shared by customers with all the financial institutions that they intend to work with. This system allows for efficiency gains, cost reduction, improved customer experience, and increased transparency throughout the process of onboarding a customer.

TI Blockchains and the crypto city
SO IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Drawing on economic transaction cost theory, this paper explores how blockchain and distributed ledger technology could shift the smart city agenda by altering transaction costs with implications for the coordination of infrastructures and resources. Like the smart city the crypto city utilizes data informatics, but can be coordinated through distributed rather than centralized systems. The data infrastructure of the crypto city can enable civil society to run local public goods and services, and facilitate economic and social entrepreneurship.

TI Toward a Robust Security Paradigm for Bluetooth Low Energy-Based Smart
   Objects in the Internet-of-Things
SO SENSORS
AB Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies to enable the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm. In BLE-based IoT applications, e.g., wearables-oriented service applications, the Bluetooth MAC addresses of devices will be swapped for device pairings. The random address technique is adopted to prevent malicious users from tracking the victim's devices with stationary Bluetooth MAC addresses and accordingly the device privacy can be preserved. However, there exists a tradeoff between privacy and security in the random address technique. That is, when device pairing is launched and one device cannot actually identify another one with addresses, it provides an opportunity for malicious users to break the system security via impersonation attacks. Hence, using random addresses may lead to higher security risks. In this study, we point out the potential risk of using random address technique and then present critical security requirements for BLE-based IoT applications. To fulfill the claimed requirements, we present a privacy-aware mechanism, which is based on elliptic curve cryptography, for secure communication and access-control among BLE-based IoT objects. Moreover, to ensure the security of smartphone application associated with BLE-based IoT objects, we construct a Smart Contract-based Investigation Report Management framework (SCIRM) which enables smartphone application users to obtain security inspection reports of BLE-based applications of interest with smart contracts.

TI Smart Contract Relations in e-Commerce: Legal Implications of Exchanges
   Conducted on the Blockchain
SO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Much of the discussion around blockchain-based smart contracts has focused on whether or not they operate in the same way as legal contracts. However, it is argued that most contracts are social rather than legal in nature and are entered into because the parties trust each other to perform the agreed exchange. Little has been written to address how the blockchain's trust protocol can enable the kind of social contracting that characterized the way exchanges were conducted before the Internet. This article aims to fill that gap by exploring blockchain-based smart contracts primarily as noncontractual social exchanges.

TI Can Cyber-Physical Systems Reliably Collaborate within a Blockchain?
SO METAPHILOSOPHY
AB A blockchain can be considered a technological phenomenon that is made up of different interconnected and autonomous systems. Such systems are referred to here as cyber-physical systems: complex interconnections of cyber and physical components. When cyber-physical systems are interconnected, a new whole consisting of a system of systems is created by the autonomous systems and their intercommunication and interaction. In a blockchain, individual systems can independently make decisions on joint information transactions. The decision-making procedures needed for this are executed based on fault-tolerant communication and voting and consensus procedures, while the results of these decision-making procedures are stored in distributed ledgers. Due to the intercommunication, interaction, and independent decision making by autonomous systems, the new whole of a blockchain is a complex entity. Complexity science rather than the usual reductionist scientific approach can help us better understand the behaviour of the new and continuously developing whole of a blockchain as a technological phenomenon.

TI Blockchain futures: With or without Bitcoin?
SO STRATEGIC CHANGE-BRIEFINGS IN ENTREPRENEURIAL FINANCE
AB Blockchain technology is considered, in some quarters, to have outgrown its primary association with the Bitcoin payments ecosystem. This belief has fostered numerous predictions of blockchain futures, in which the Bitcoin ecosystem is largely absent. It is nevertheless wholly possible to imagine a future for blockchain in which Bitcoin plays a presiding role. In drawing attention to subtexts of this kind, expectations of the future can prove highly persuasive within the context of technology selection and adoption processes of the present, lending an invisible hand to the design of business models, while also guiding strategic choices and the purchasing decisions made by managers.

TI A Proposed Currency System for Academic Peer Review Payments Using the
   BlockChain Technology
SO PUBLICATIONS
AB Peer review of scholarly papers is seen to be a critical step in the publication of high quality outputs in reputable journals. However, it appears that there are few incentives for researchers to agree to conduct suitable reviews in a timely fashion and in some cases unscrupulous practices are occurring as part of the production of academic research output. Innovations in internet-based technologies mean that there are ways in which some of the challenges can be addressed. In particular, this paper proposes a new currency system using the BlockChain as its basis that provides a number of solutions. Potential benefits and problems of using the technology are discussed in the paper and these will need further investigation should the idea develop further. Ultimately, the currency could be used as an alternative publication metric for authors, institutions and journals.

AB Blockchain has drawn attention as the next-generation financial technology due to its security that suits the informatization era. In particular, it provides security through the authentication of peers that share virtual cash, encryption, and the generation of hash value. According to the global financial industry, the market for security-based blockchain technology is expected to grow to about USD 20 billion by 2020. In addition, blockchain can be applied beyond the Internet of Things (IoT) environment; its applications are expected to expand. Cloud computing has been dramatically adopted in all IT environments for its efficiency and availability. In this paper, we discuss the concept of blockchain technology and its hot research trends. In addition, we will study how to adapt blockchain security to cloud computing and its secure solutions in detail.

TI Temperature and concentration calibration of aqueous
   polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solutions for isotropic diffusion MRI
   phantoms
SO PLOS ONE
AB To use the "apparent diffusion coefficient" (D-app) as a quantitative imaging parameter, wellsuited test fluids are essential. In this study, the previously proposed aqueous solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were examined and temperature calibrations were obtained. For example, at a temperature of 20 degrees C, D-app ranged from 1.594 (95% CI: 1.593, 1.595) mu m(2)/ms to 0.3326 (95% CI: 0. 3304, 0.3348) mu m(2)/ms for PVP-concentrations ranging from 10% (w/w) to 50% (w/w) using K30 polymer lengths. The temperature dependence of Dapp was found to be so strong that a negligence seems not advisable. The temperature dependence is descriptively modelled by an exponential function exp(c(2) (T-20 degrees C)) and the determined c(2) values are reported, which can be used for temperature calibration. For example, we find the value 0.02952 K-1 for 30% (w/ w) PVP-concentration and K30 polymer length. In general, aqueous PVP solutions were found to be suitable to produce easily applicable and reliable D-app-phantoms.

TI Traits across the personality hierarchy differentially relate to
   positive and negative affect: Evidence for the predictive validity of
   empirically derived meta-traits
SO PERSONALITY AND MENTAL HEALTH
AB There is increasing interest in the construct validity of higher-order domains of the Big Five personality traits. A total of 831 persons from the Swiss population completed the International Personality Item Pool and an adaptation of the Positive and Negative Affect Scales. Using Goldberg's [1] bass-ackwards method, we found evidence for the general factor of personality (GFP) and the two meta-traits of positive emotionality (blend of low neuroticism and high extraversion) and constraint (blend of high agreeableness and conscientiousness). In association with positive affect, the explanatory power of the GFP (r = 0.43) and positive emotionality (r = 0.37) was largely superior to extraversion (r = 0.24), conscientiousness (r = 0.18), agreeableness (r = 0.09) and openness (r = 0.04), although not neuroticism (r = -0.34). In association with negative affect, neuroticism (r = 0.41), the GFP (r = -0.36) and positive emotionality (r = -0.35) were the most powerful single predictors. We conclude that the higher-order structure of personality is best explained by the meta-traits of positive emotionality and constraint, which correspond closely to the well-established superfactors of internalizing and externalizing. We further demonstrate that these have substantial criterion validity when broad positive and negative affect is the outcome of interest. These findings help to relate Big Five meta-traits to pathological personality. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI Story Blocks: Reimagining narrative through the blockchain
SO CONVERGENCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO NEW MEDIA
   TECHNOLOGIES
AB Digital technology is changing, and has changed the ways we create and consume narratives, from moving images and immersive storyworlds to digital long-form and multi-branched story experiences. At the same time, blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, is revolutionizing the way that transactions and exchanges occur. As a globally stored and collaboratively written list of all transactions that have ever taken place within a given system, the blockchain decentralizes money and offers a platform for its creative use. There are already examples of blockchain technologies extending beyond the realm of currency, including the decentralization of domain name servers that are not subject to government takedown and identity management and governance. By framing key blockchain concepts with past and present storytelling practices, this article raises questions as to how the principles and implementation of such distributed ledger technologies might be used within contemporary writing practices - that is, can we imagine stories as a currency or value system? We present three experiments that draw on some of the fundamental principles of blockchain and Bitcoin, as an instantiation of a blockchain implemented application, namely, (1) the ledger, (2) the blocks and (3) the mining process. Each low-fi experiment was intentionally designed to be very accessible to take part in and understand and all were conducted as discrete workshops with different sets of participants. Participants included a cohort of design students, technology industry and design professionals and writing and interaction design academics. Each experiment raised a different set of reflections and subsequent questions on the nature of digital, the linearity (or not) of narratives and collaborative processes.

TI Buzz Factor or Innovation Potential: What Explains Cryptocurrencies'
   Returns?
SO PLOS ONE
AB Cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular since the introduction of bitcoin in 2009. In this paper, we identify factors associated with variations in cryptocurrencies' market values. In the past, researchers argued that the "buzz" surrounding cryptocurrencies in online media explained their price variations. But this observation obfuscates the notion that cryptocurrencies, unlike fiat currencies, are technologies entailing a true innovation potential. By using, for the first time, a unique measure of innovation potential, we find that the latter is in fact the most important factor associated with increases in cryptocurrency returns. By contrast, we find that the buzz surrounding cryptocurrencies is negatively associated with returns after controlling for a variety of factors, such as supply growth and liquidity. Also interesting is our finding that a cryptocurrency's association with fraudulent activity is not negatively associated with weekly returns-a result that further qualifies the media's influence on cryptocurrencies. Finally, we find that an increase in supply is positively associated with weekly returns. Taken together, our findings show that cryptocurrencies do not behave like traditional currencies or commodities-unlike what most prior research has assumed-and depict an industry that is much more mature, and much less speculative, than has been implied by previous accounts.

AB In contrast to electronic travel documents (e.g. ePass-ports), the standardisation of breeder documents (e.g. birth certificates), regarding harmonisation of content and contained security features is in statu nascendi. Due to the fact that breeder documents can be used as an evidence of identity and enable the application for electronic travel documents, they pose the weakest link in the identity life cycle and represent a security gap for identity management.
   In this work, we present a cost efficient way to enhance the long-term security of breeder documents by utilizing blockchain technology. A conceptual architecture to enhance breeder document long-term security and an introduction of the concept's constituting system components is presented. Our investigations provide evidence that the Bitcoin blockchain is most suitable for breeder document long-term security.

AB Distributed storage platforms draw much attention due to their high reliability and scalability for handling a massive amount of data. To protect user and data privacy, encryption is considered as a necessary feature for production systems like Storj. But it prohibits the nodes from performing content search. To preserve the functionality, we observe that a protocol of integration with searchable encryption and keyword search via distributed hash table allows the nodes in a network to search over encrypted and distributed data. However, this protocol does not address a practical threat in a fully distributed scenario. Malicious nodes would sabotage search results, and easily infiltrate the system as the network grows. Using primitives such as MAC and verifiable data structure may empower the users to verify the search result, but the robustness of the overall system can hardly be ensured. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a protocol that is seamlessly incorporated to encrypted search in distributed network to attest and monitor nodes. From the moment a node joins the system, it will be attested and continuously monitored through verifiable search queries. The result of each attestation is determined via a standard quorum-based voting protocol, and then recorded on the blockchain as a consensus view of trusted nodes. Based on the proposed protocols, malicious nodes can be detected and removed by a majority of nodes in a self-determining manner. To demonstrate the security and efficiency, we conduct robustness analysis against several potential attacks, and perform performance and overhead evaluation on the proposed protocol.

AB Emerging decentralized storage services such as Storj and Filecoin show promise as a new paradigm for data outsourcing. These services tie cryptocurrency to personal storage resources and leverage blockchain technology to ensure data integrity in distributed networks. Compared to current cloud storage, they are expected to be more scalable, cost effective, and secure. In addition to the features above, strong guarantees of data privacy are seriously desired due to today's prevalent data leak and abuse incidents. However, simply using end-to-end encryption limits the search capability and thus will degrade the user experience.
   In this paper, we propose an encrypted decentralized storage architecture that can support trustworthy and private keyword search functions. We start from searchable encryption to achieve search on encrypted data. Yet, only adopting this primitive is not sufficient to address particular threats in our target decentralized service model. Service peers would maliciously return incorrect results, while user peers would fraudulently refuse to pay service fees. To resolve those threats, we devise specific secure data addition and keyword search protocols to enable client-side verifiability and blockchain based fair judgments on the search results. For practical considerations, we integrate an efficient dynamic searchable encryption scheme to our protocols as an instantiation to lower the blockchain overhead. Our security and performance analysis indicates the advance of the proposed architecture.

AB In the context of current energy Internet, the emergence of a large number of energy productive consumers will create a new business model. In the decentralized electricity market, the cost of traditional centralized solution construction, management and maintenance is too high, and it is difficult to support the collection, transmission, reception, storage and analysis of massive data. To provide a solution to this phenomenon, we apply the blockchain technology to this distributed electricity market to achieve peer to peer transactions in the power systems. The blockchain technology which is very popular nowadays will be used in power system to establish a credible direct transaction between devices. At first, this article analyzes the future direction of the development of power systems, studies the characteristics of decentralized power systems and summarizes the main issues in the development process. Then, we analyze the basic characteristics of blockchain and put forward a new transaction framework in consideration of problems existing in current energy market. The transaction framework is based on the blockchain technology in the distributed electricity market and includes the pricing method, the power transaction system architecture, various modules of the trading system and the details of the whole transaction system runtime. This framework provides a viable solution for increasingly complex energy transactions.

AB Micropayments (payments worth a few pennies) have numerous potential applications. A challenge in achieving them is that payment networks charge fees that are high compared to "micro" sums of money.
   Wheeler (1996) and Rivest (1997) proposed probabilistic payments as a technique to achieve micropayments: a merchant receives a macro-value payment with a given probability so that, in expectation, he receives a micro-value payment. Despite much research and trial deployment, micropayment schemes have not seen adoption, partly because a trusted party is required to process payments and resolve disputes.
   The widespread adoption of decentralized currencies such as Bitcoin (2009) suggests that decentralized micropayment schemes are easier to deploy. Pass and Shelat (2015) proposed several micropayment schemes for Bitcoin, but their schemes provide no more privacy guarantees than Bitcoin itself, whose transactions are recorded in plaintext in a public ledger.
   We formulate and construct decentralized anonymous micropayment (DAM) schemes, which enable parties with access to a ledger to conduct offline probabilistic payments with one another, directly and privately. Our techniques extend those of Zerocash (2014) with a new privacy-preserving probabilistic payment protocol. One of the key ingredients of our construction is fractional message transfer (FMT), a primitive that enables probabilistic message transmission between two parties, and for which we give an efficient instantiation.
   Double spending in our setting cannot be prevented. Our second contribution is an economic analysis that bounds the additional utility gain of any cheating strategy, and applies to virtually any probabilistic payment scheme with offline validation. In our construction, this bound allows us to deter double spending by way of advance deposits that are revoked when cheating is detected.

AB Residential microgrids (MGs) may host a large number of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). The strategy that maximizes the revenue for each individual DER is the one in which the DER operates at capacity, injecting all available power into the grid. However, when the DER penetration is high and the consumption low, this strategy may lead to power surplus that causes voltage increase over recommended limits. In order to create incentives for the DER to operate below capacity, we propose a proportional-fairness control strategy in which (i) a subset of DERs decrease their own power output, sacrificing the individual revenue, and (ii) the DERs in the subset are dynamically selected based on the record of their control history. The trustworthy implementation of the scheme is carried out through a custom-designed blockchain mechanism that maintains a distributed database trusted by all DERs. In particular, the blockchain is used to stipulate and store a smart contract that enforces proportional fairness. The simulation results verify the potential of the proposed framework.

AB Blockchain technology is regarded as highly disruptive, but there is a lack of formalization and standardization of terminology. Not only because there are several (sometimes propriety) implementation platforms, but also because the academic literature so far is predominantly written from either a purely technical or an economic application perspective. The result of the confusion is an offspring of blockchain solutions, types, roadmaps and interpretations. For blockchain to be accepted as a technology standard in established industries, it is pivotal that ordinary internet users and business executives have a basic yet fundamental understanding of the workings and impact of blockchain. This conceptual paper provides a theoretical contribution and guidance on what blockchain actually is by taking an ontological approach. Enterprise Ontology is used to make a clear distinction between the datalogical, infological and essential level of blockchain transactions and smart contracts.

AB The IoT is innovative and important phenomenon prone to several services ad applications, but it should consider the legal issues related to the data protection law.
   However, should be taken into account the legal issues related to the data protection and privacy law. Technological solutions are welcome, but it is necessary, before developing applications, to consider the risks which we cannot dismiss. Personal data is a value. In this context is fundamental to evaluate the legal issues and prevent them, adopting in each project the privacy by design approach. Regarding the privacy and security risks, there are some issues with potential consequences for data security and liability. The IoT system allows us to transfer data on the Internet, including personal data. In this context, it is important to consider the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - already in force from 24 May 2016 - that will be applicable on 25 May 2018. The GDPR introduces Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), data breach notification and very hard administrative fines in respect of infringements of the Regulation. A correct law analysis allows evaluating risks preventing the wrong use of personal data.
   The IoT ecosystem is evolving quickly, developing several applications in different sectors. The main topics for the last time are Big Data and the blockchain. People are paying attention to the latest one because of its potential concrete use for services and applications, increasing the security measures to guarantee a secure system. However, it is equally important to analyse the legal issues related to them. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her. In this context, we cannot dismiss to guarantee an adequate protection of personal data designing any application. The contribution describes the main legal issues related to privacy and data protection especially regarding the blockchain, focusing on the Privacy by Design approach, according to the GDPR. Furthermore, I resolutely believe that is possible to develop a worldwide privacy standard framework that organisations can use for their data protection activities.

AB Cloud federation is an emergent cloud-computing paradigm where partner organisations share data and services hosted on their own cloud platforms.
   In this context, it is crucial to enforce access control policies that satisfy data protection and privacy requirements of partner organisations. However, due to the distributed nature of cloud federations, the access control system alone does not guarantee that its deployed components cannot be circumvented while processing access requests.
   In order to promote accountability and reliability of a distributed access control system, we present a decentralised runtime monitoring architecture based on blockchain technology.

AB Crypto-ransomware is a challenging threat that ciphers a user's files while hiding the decryption key until a ransom is paid by the victim. This type of malware is a lucrative business for cybercriminals, generating millions of dollars annually. The spread of ransomware is increasing as traditional detection-based protection, such as antivirus and anti-malware, has proven ineffective at preventing attacks. Additionally, this form of malware is incorporating advanced encryption algorithms and expanding the number of file types it targets. Cybercriminals have found a lucrative market and no one is safe from being the next victim. Encrypting ransomware targets business small and large as well as the regular home user. This paper discusses ransomware methods of infection, technology behind it and what can be done to help prevent becoming the next victim. The paper investigates the most common types of crypto-ransomware, various payload methods of infection, typical behavior of crypto ransomware, its tactics, how an attack is ordinarily carried out, what files are most commonly targeted on a victim's computer, and recommendations for prevention and safeguards are listed as well.

AB Most online lotteries today fail to ensure the verifiability of the random process and rely on a trusted third party. This issue has received little attention since the emergence of distributed protocols like Bitcoin that demonstrated the potential of protocols with no trusted third party. We argue that the security requirements of online lotteries are similar to those of online voting, and propose a novel distributed online lottery protocol that applies techniques developed for voting applications to an existing lottery protocol. As a result, the protocol is scalable, provides efficient verification of the random process and does not rely on a trusted third party nor on assumptions of bounded computational resources. An early prototype confirms the feasibility of our approach.

AB Complexity of electric/electronics (E/E) in automobiles increases tremendously due to more connectivity and real-time data processing. Hence, huge volatility of E/E artifacts is the consequence. In order to keep track of all changes made from early systems engineering to late after sales, a permeable traceability in data management systems has to be achieved. Therefore, this elaboration adapts the blockchain technology to achieve traceability of E/E development artifacts from early model-based systems engineering (MBSE) till after sales. By this, MBSE is linked to product data management and the automobile's configuration is known at each instant of time. The Digital Twin, a digital, domain-specific representation of the physical vehicle in one front end tool, makes the complexity still feasible to handle and is empowered by the blockchain. Hence, traceability of E/E artifacts over an automobile's lifecycle including MBSE is fostered in a manageable manner.

AB As cities become increasingly dense, they must turn to novel technologies and frameworks to address the mobility challenges that will arise. 50% of trips in the U.S. are less than 3 miles, and could be replaced by a more sustainable and space-efficient mode of transportation, such as bicycling, if effective policies and incentives were implemented.
   This abstract presents a financial incentives system to increase the prevalence of urban cycling. The blockchainbased system allows cyclists to receive financial compensation from organizations, such as city governments or local businesses, that would like to sponsor cyclists. Using bicycle-powered sensors, cyclists collect and redeem their activity data through smart contracts stored and executed on an Ethereum blockchain. The use of blockchain technology makes transactions secure, trustworthy, and timely.
   This project envisions expanding this data platform to include additional bicycle-based sensors that cyclists use to collect and sell data, monetizing their commuting habits, and building a scalable and stable solution for encouraging sustainable transportation in cities.

However, there are still many serious problems in real blockchain systems in IP network such as the lack of support for multicast and the hierarchies of status. In this paper, we design a bitcoin-like blockchain system named BlockNDN over Named Data Networking and we implement and deploy it on our cluster as well. The resulting design solves those problems in IP network. It provides completely decentralized systems and simplifies system architecture. It also improves the weak-connectivity phenomenon and decreases the broadcast overhead.

AB Merged mining refers to the concept of mining more than one cryptocurrency without necessitating additional proof-of-work effort. Although merged mining has been adopted by a number of cryptocurrencies already, to this date little is known about the effects and implications. We shed light on this topic area by performing a comprehensive analysis of merged mining in practice. As part of this analysis, we present a block attribution scheme for mining pools to assist in the evaluation of mining centralization. Our findings disclose that mining pools in merge-mined cryptocurrencies have operated at the edge of, and even beyond, the security guarantees offered by the underlying Nakamoto consensus for extended periods. We discuss the implications and security considerations for these cryptocurrencies and the mining ecosystem as a whole, and link our findings to the intended effects of merged mining.

Paper presents three different ways in which a user can manage bitcoins. We attempt to identify the security risk and feasible attacks on these configurations of bitcoin management. We have shown that not all bitcoin wallets are safe against all possible types of attacks. Bitcoin core is only safest mode of operating bitcoin till date as it is secure against all feasible attacks, and is vulnerable only against block-chain rewriting.

AB In the modern world that we live in everything is gradually shifting towards a more digitized outlook. From teaching methods to online transactions, every small aspect of our life is given a more technological touch. In such a case "money" is not left behind either. An approach towards digitizing money led to the creation of "bitcoin". Bitcoin is the most efficient crypto-currency so far in the history of digital currency. Ruling out the interference of any third party which monitors the cash flow, Bitcoin is a decentralized form of online currency and is widely accepted for internet transactions all over the world. The need for digital money would be extensive in the near future.

AB As blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies increase in popularity, their decentralization poses unique challenges in network partitions. In traditional distributed systems, network partitions are generally a result of bugs or connectivity failures; the typical goal of the system designer is to automatically recover from such issues as seamlessly as possible. Blockchain-based systems, however, rely on purposeful "forks" to roll out protocol changes in a decentralized manner. Not all users may agree with proposed changes, and thus forks can persist, leading to permanent network partitions.
   In this paper, we closely study the large-scale fork that occurred in Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that allows for both currency transactions and smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of over $28B. We explore the consequences of this fork, showing the impact on the two networks and their mining pools, and how the fork lead to unintentional incentives and security vulnerabilities.

AB We present the first large-scale survey to investigate how users experience the Bitcoin ecosystem in terms of security, privacy and anonymity. We surveyed 990 Bitcoin users to determine Bitcoin management strategies and identified how users deploy security measures to protect their keys and bitcoins. We found that about 46% of our participants use web-hosted solutions to manage at least some of their bitcoins, and about half of them use exclusively such solutions. We also found that many users do not use all security capabilities of their selected Bitcoin management tool and have significant misconceptions on how to remain anonymous and protect their privacy in the Bitcoin network. Also, 22% of our participants have already lost money due to security breaches or self-induced errors. To get a deeper understanding, we conducted qualitative interviews to explain some of the observed phenomena.

AB With the development of ICT industry, the volume of produced data is experiencing tremendous growth, which motivates more demands of storage capacity. Because of the limited storage capacity of users' terminals, more and more applications prefer to upload data to cloud platforms. However, it is well known that security should not be neglected in existing cloud storage architectures. Motivated by the increasing popularity of emerging blockchain technology, we propose a blockchain-based security architecture for distributed cloud storage. Moreover, we customize a genetic algorithm to solve the file block replica placement problem between multiple users and multiple data centers in the distributed cloud storage environment. Numerical experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the traditional cloud storage architectures in terms of security, with acceptable network transmission delay.

AB Enabled by mobile and wearable technology, personal health data delivers immense and increasing value for healthcare, benefiting both care providers and medical research. The secure and convenient sharing of personal health data is crucial to the improvement of the interaction and collaboration of the healthcare industry. Faced with the potential privacy issues and vulnerabilities existing in current personal health data storage and sharing systems, as well as the concept of self-sovereign data ownership, we propose an innovative user-centric health data sharing solution by utilizing a decentralized and permissioned blockchain to protect privacy using channel formation scheme and enhance the identity management using the membership service supported by the blockchain. A mobile application is deployed to collect health data from personal wearable devices, manual input, and medical devices, and synchronize data to the cloud for data sharing with healthcare providers and health insurance companies. To preserve the integrity of health data, within each record, a proof of integrity and validation is permanently retrievable from cloud database and is anchored to the blockchain network. Moreover, for scalable and performance considerations, we adopt a tree-based data processing and batching method to handle large data sets of personal health data collected and uploaded by the mobile platform.

AB With widely adoption of Bitcoin, Many malicious software trying to steal bitcoins through network has emerged in a large scale. Bitcoin makes heavy use of elliptic curve digital signature algorithm to guarantee transactions security. Each user can have lots of addresses hashed from his public keys to receive coins, and need private keys associated with these addresses to authorize spending those coins. A Bitcoin wallet give a good assistance to manage and preserve all private keys belong to its owner. However, saving complete private keys on local storage meets a big challenge in case of theft. For the purpose of securing user's private keys, we propose an efficient method to enhance Bitcoin wallet security. We combine random seeds and a passphrase for user easy to keep in mind to generate private keys whenever needed. It is only need to reserve a list of random seeds on local storage instead of complete private keys. Nobody could generate the whole private keys just relying on random seeds without the passphrase. Therefore, our method increases the difficulty for attackers to steal bitcoins. We also introduce a key recovery approach in case of the passphrase being forgotten. Our method does not incur any additional operations and is convenient to use by a common customer without professional knowledge.

AB This chapter examines both academic and grey literature on the transitions and developments in e-government towards notions of open government and open governance. This is viewed through the prism of European level strategies, the EU's research and innovation programmes, as well as common strategies like the European E-Government Action Plan agreed to by all EU Member States. The three strands of the proposed European open governance setting, consisting of open data, open service and open process, are examined, as is the conceptualization of government as an open source service platform as well as a broader platform for collaboration between all societal actors. The purpose is to support societal-wide innovation for tackling pressing societal challenges where the role of ICT is seen more broadly than has traditionally been the case, i.e. as a general purpose technology. In this context, the chapter also examines emerging technologies likely to impact government in the short as well as longer-term, such as big data, artificial intelligence, drones and blockchain.

AB Bitcoin is the first widely adopted decentralized digital e-cash system. All Bitcoin transactions that include addresses of senders and receivers are stored in the public blockchain which could cause privacy problems. The Zerocoin protocol hides the link between individual Bitcoin transactions without adding trusted third parties. However such an un-traceable remittance system could cause illegal transfers such as money laundering. In this paper we address this problem and propose an auditable decentralized e-cash scheme based on the Zerocoin protocol. Our scheme allows designated auditors to extract link information from Zerocoin transactions while preventing other users including miners from obtaining it. Respecting the mind of the decentralized system, the auditor doesn't have other authorities such as stopping transfers, confiscating funds, and deactivating accounts. A technical contribution of our scheme is that a coin sender embeds audit information with a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge (NIZKP). This zero-knowledge prevents malicious senders from embedding indiscriminate audit information, and we construct it simply using only the standard Schnorr protocol for discrete logarithm without zk-SNARKs or other recent techniques for zero-knowledge proof.

AB As the number of Web APIs is rapidly increasing, it is an urgent issue to discover qualified Web APIs and provide value-added services by orchestrating them. However, most of the interface descriptions of Web APIs are informal, and the Web API SLA contracts, which are a key to quality of services orchestration, require manual operations at the consumers. Meanwhile, applying the blockchain, the distributed ledger technology, to various domains beyond Fintech is attracting attention because of its fault-tolerant and anti-tampering. However, it isn't applied to Web API SLA contracts, yet. In this article, the authors propose a formal specification description of Web APIs together with its associated SLA specifications based on RDF, and an SLA contract method based on the common SLA contract platform built on the blockchain. We implemented the prototype of the SLA contract platform, and applied it to the examples for demonstrating its feasibility. Those experiences prove the feasibility of the proposed Web API SLA contract method and its supporting platform.

AB In this paper we introduce a game-theoretic model for reward functions in Bitcoin mining pools. Our model consists only of an unordered history of reported shares and gives participating miners the strategy choices of either reporting or delaying when they discover a share or full solution. We defined a precise condition for incentive compatibility to ensure miners strategy choices optimize the welfare of the pool as a whole. With this definition we show that proportional mining rewards are not incentive compatible in this model. We introduce and analyze a novel reward function which is incentive compatible in this model. Finally we show that the popular reward function pay-per-last-N-shares is also incentive compatible in a more general model.

AB Applications requiring strict access control, such as medical record query, often require auditing of the query. The current typical design relies on server side logging. However, logging on server-side do not provide strict means of auditing, since the server can be tampered with attackers, and also anybody who has permission to write can modify the log. We propose a scheme using blockchain technology, as a request-response channel for a client-server system, to record both client request and server reply in an audi-table manner. We have implemented a proof-of-concept system on top of a publicly available blockchain testbed. By using a blockchain as a client-server request-response channel, the request-response sequence can be verified by anybody who has access to the blockchain, providing a way to implement audit log for strictly controlled resources.

AB Covert cryptocurrency mining operations are causing notable losses to both cloud providers and enterprises. Increased power consumption resulting from constant CPU and GPU usage from mining, inflated cooling and electricity costs, and wastage of resources that could otherwise benefit legitimate users are some of the factors that contribute to these incurred losses. Affected organizations currently have no way of detecting these covert, and at times illegal miners and often discover the abuse when attackers have already fled and the damage is done.
   In this paper, we present Mine Guard, a tool that can detect mining behavior in real-time across pools of mining VMs or processes, and prevent abuse despite an active adversary trying to bypass the defenses. Our system employs hardware-assisted profiling to create discernible signatures for various mining algorithms and can accurately detect these, with negligible overhead (<0.01%), for both CPU and GPU-based miners. We empirically demonstrate the uniqueness of mining behavior and show the effectiveness of our mitigation approach(approximate to 99.7% detection rate). Furthermore, we characterize the noise introduced by virtualization and incorporate it into our detection mechanism making it highly robust. The design of MineGuard is both practical and usable and requires no modification to the core infrastructure of commercial clouds or enterprises.

In this paper, we present a technical combination that consists of Blockchain structure, network sharing model and consensus algorithms. With these techniques, we design and implement a Blockchain-based GIR sharing system (BGIRSS), which is decentralized, to make the sharing procedure more efficient. The results of a series of emulational experiments show that our system is securer and more reliable than conventional sharing schemes, and can effectively promote the sharing efficiency of GIRs with lower implementation cost.

AB The Internet of Things technology has been widely used in the quality tracking of agricultural products, however, the safety of storage for tracked data is still a serious challenge. Recently, with the expansion of blockchain technology applied in cross-industry field, the unchangeable features of its stored data provide us new vision about ensuring the storage safety for tracked data. Unfortunately, when the blockchain technology is directly applied in agricultural products tracking and data storage, it is difficult to automate storage and obtain the hash data stored in the blockchain in batches base on the identity. Addressing this issue, we propose a double-chain storage structure, and design a secured data storage scheme for tracking agricultural products based on blockchain. Specifically, the chained data structure is utilized to store the blockchain transaction hash, and together with the chain of the blockchain to form a double-chain storage, which ensures the data of agricultural products will not be maliciously tampered or destructed. Finally, in the practical application system, we verify the correctness and security of the proposed storage scheme.

AB In the Big Data era, personal metadata may will become a new type of corporate asset, however there have already been a growing public concern about user's privacy mined from metadata. In this paper we address the problem of implementing the self-sovereignty of personal metadata on the existing OpenPDS/SafeAnswers framework according to the Windhover Principle. In order to do that, we propose a new framework, called BlocakChain-based Personal Data Store (BC-PDS), to realize two basic properties: notary and autonomy. This framework, firstly introduces the BlockChain as a notary, into OpenPDS/ SafeAnswers for secure storage of personal meta-data instead of the original database. Next, we present an AutoNomybased Access Control (ANAC) to improve the SafeAnswers module, where ANAC is a new mechanism that enforces access based on the relationship among all authorized users and metadata's owner. In addition, we also propose General Access Structure (GAS) and threshold secret sharing scheme in BlockChain as an implementation method for our BC-PDS framework.

TI From Walras' auctioneer to continuous time double auctions: a general
   dynamic theory of supply and demand
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
AB In standard Walrasian auctions, the price of a good is defined as the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. Since both curves are generically regular, the response to small perturbations is linearly small. However, a crucial ingredient is absent of the theory, namely transactions themselves. What happens after they occur? To answer the question, we develop a dynamic theory for supply and demand based on agents with heterogeneous beliefs. When the inter-auction time is infinitely long, the Walrasian mechanism is recovered. When transactions are allowed to happen in continuous time, a peculiar property emerges: close to the price, supply and demand vanish quadratically, which we empirically confirm on the Bitcoin. This explains why price impact in financial markets is universally observed to behave as the square root of the excess volume. The consequences are important, as they imply that the very fact of clearing the market makes prices hypersensitive to small fluctuations.

   polymerization-induced self-assembly of amphiphilic poly(methacrylic
   acid)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid)
SO COLLOID AND POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The formation mechanisms of worm-like vesicles were determined by the photopolymerization-induced self-assembly of an amphiphilic poly(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate-random-methacrylic acid) diblock copolymer, PMAA-b-P(MMA-r-MAA). The photopolymerization-induced self-assembly was performed by the nitroxde-mediated photo-controlled/living radical polymerization in an aqueous methanol solution using a PMAA end-capped with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl. The polymerization retained its living nature during the self-assembly. The copolymer during the early stage of the polymerization produced cup-like vesicles that had some holes in the surface and were comprised of a thin and flexible bilayer. As the hydrophobic P(MMA-r-MAA) block chain was extended by the polymerization progress, the cup-like vesicles were transformed into spherical vesicles, accompanied by decreases in the number of holes and their size. Further extension of the hydrophobic block chain enhanced the intervesicular aggregation to provide worm-like vesicles. These morphological changes were accounted for by variation in the critical packing shape of the copolymer by expansion of the hydrophobic chain volume.

TI New RESOLVE-Based Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging in MRI-Visible Prostate
   Cancer: Effect of Reduced b Value on Image Quality and Diagnostic
   Effectiveness
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
AB OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to investigate whether a new readout segmentation of long variable echo-trains (RESOLVE)-based diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) with reduced b value technique can affect image quality and diagnostic effectiveness in MRI-visible prostate cancer (PCA).
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Prostatic RESOLVE DKI (0-1400 s/mm(2)) was prospectively performed for 12 volunteers. The optimal protocol was then performed in 108 MRI-visible PCAs to determine whether it can compete against a preferred b-value set (0-2000 s/mm(2)) regarding image quality and diagnostic effectiveness. Images were interpreted by two independent radiologists using the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS). Readers' concordance and diagnostic effectiveness were tested with the Fleiss kappa and area under the ROC curve (A(z)) analyses.
   RESULTS. A b value of 1400 s/mm(2) generated a larger apparent diffusion coefficient of gaussian distribution (Dapp) (1.35 +/- 0.31 vs 1.30 +/- 0.30 mm(2)/s; p < 0.001) and apparent kurtosis coefficient (Kapp) (1.11 +/- 0.26 vs 1.00 +/- 0.21; p < 0.001) in PCA than did a b value of 2000 s/mm(2). Interreader agreement using PI-RADS was relatively low when Dapp and Kapp maps were excluded from image interpretations (kappa = 0.39-0.41 vs kappa = 0.66-0.68 with Dapp and Kapp maps). Interreader agreement in staging PCA was relatively high (kappa > 0.80) and was not influenced by reducing the b value. The power of Dapp and Kapp to differentiate PCA from normal tissue (A(z) = 0.97-0.98), tissue with a Gleason score less than or equal to 3 + 4 from tissue with a Gleason score greater than 3 + 4 (A(z) = 0.77-0.82), and PCA stage lower than pT3 from stage pT3 and higher PCA (A(z) = 0.70-0.75) was not significantly degraded by reducing the b value.
   CONCLUSION. We found that b values significantly influenced image quality, PI-RADS score, and DKI outputs but did not degrade the diagnostic effectiveness of DKI parameters to detect and classify PCA.

TI Virtual Currencies, the Money Market, and Monetary Policy
SO INTERNATIONAL ADVANCES IN ECONOMIC RESEARCH
AB Virtual currencies are in vogue mainly due to two factors. First, as a protest against authority-driven monetary policy decisions and second, as alternatives to deficits in some monetary systems arising out of political instability or other causes. Assuming that virtual currencies indeed (partially) replace national currencies as payment vehicles, we attempt, in this article, to integrate the virtual currency supply and demand into the Keynesian money market framework. This article presents a few results for the central banks and outlines problems that may result for monetary policy formulation. Since this is the first such attempt to model a national money market as a combination of nationally-issued currency and globally-issued virtual currency, certain simplistic assumptions have been made. Nevertheless, the model offers directions on the impact of virtual currencies on the monetary system and the national money market. Additionally, the paper integrates the official standpoints of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on this topic.

AB In this paper we explore several contexts where an adversary has an upper hand over the defender by using special hardware in an attack. These include password processing, hard-drive protection, cryptocurrency mining, resource sharing, code obfuscation, etc.
   We suggest memory-hard computing as a generic paradigm, where every task is amalgamated with a certain procedure requiring intensive access to RAM both in terms of size and (very importantly) bandwidth, so that transferring the computation to GPU, FPGA, and even ASIC brings little or no cost reduction. Cryptographic schemes that run in this framework become egalitarian in the sense that both users and attackers are equal in the price-performance ratio conditions. Based on existing schemes like Argon2 and the recent generalized-birthday proof-of-work, we suggest a generic framework and two new schemes:
   MTP, a memory-hard Proof-of-Work based on the memory-hard function with fast verification and short proofs. It can be also used for memory-hard time-lock puzzles.
   MHE, the concept of memory-hard encryption, which utilizes available RAM to strengthen the encryption for the low-entropy keys (allowing to bring back 6 letter passwords).

We conduct a thorough analysis of related work and present a formal analysis of the new rolling blockchain, comparing the results to a traditional blockchain model to demonstrate that the deletion of data from the blockchain does not impact on the security of the proposed blockchain model before concluding our work and presenting future work to be conducted.

AB Multisignature schemes constitute important primitives when it comes to save the storage and bandwidth costs in presence of multiple signers. Such constructions are extensively used in financial applications such as Bitcoins, where more than one key is required in order to authorize Bitcoin transactions. However, many of the current state-of-the-art multisignature schemes are based on the RSA or discrete-log assumptions, which may become insecure in the future, for example due to the possibility of quantum attacks. In this paper we propose a new multisignature scheme that is built on top of the intractability of lattice problems that remain hard to solve even in presence of powerful quantum computers. The size of a multisignature is quasi optimal and our scheme can also easily be transformed into a more general aggregate signature scheme. Finally, we give an efficient implementation of the scheme which testifies its practicality and competitive capacity.

AB Low cost, high performance and on-demand access of cloud infrastructure facilitates individuals and organizations to outsource their high volume of data to cloud storage system. With continuously increasing demand of cloud storage, security of users' data in cloud is becoming a great challenge. One of the security concerns is ensuring integrity of the data stored in the cloud, and trusted third-party based public auditing is a standard technique for cloud data authentication. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an auditing scheme for cloud data without requiring a third party. We exploit the block-chain data structure of Bitcoins to propose an auditing mechanism whereby any user can perform the validation of selected files efficiently. In case a user does not possess the required computational resource for verification, or a user is reluctant to do the verification, our scheme provides the option for third party verification as well, without any additional overhead of data structure, computation or storage.

AB In the setting of blockchain based transaction ledgers we study the problem of "simplified payment verification" (SPV) which refers to the setting of a transaction verifier that wishes to examine the last k blocks of the blockchain (e.g., for the purpose of verification of a certain transaction) using as only advice the genesis block (or some "checkpoint" block that is known to it).
   The straightforward solution to this task requires the delivery of the blockchain, the verification of the proof of work it contains, and subsequently the examination of the last k blocks. It follows that the communication required to complete this task is linear in the length of the chain.
   At first thought the above seems the best one can hope: a sublinear in the length of the chain solution to the problem will be susceptible to an attacker that, using precomputation, can fool the verifier.
   Contrary to this intuition, we show that with a suitable modification to the current Bitcoin blockchain protocol (that incurs a single hash expansion in each block and gives rise to the notion of an interconnected blockchain) we can produce proofs of proof of work with sublinear complexity in the length of the chain hence enabling SPV to be performed much more efficiently.

AB Bitcoin as deployed today does not scale. Scalability research has focused on two directions: (1) redesigning the Blockchain protocol, and (2) facilitating 'off-chain transactions' and only consulting the Blockchain if an adjudicator is required. In this paper we focus on the latter and provide an overview of Bitcoin payment networks. These consist of two components: payment channels to facilitate off-chain transactions between two parties, and the capability to fairly exchange bitcoins across multiple channels. We compare Duplex Micropayment Channels and Lightning Channels, before discussing Hashed Time-Locked Contracts which enable Bitcoin-based payment networks. Finally, we highlight challenges for route discovery in these networks.

AB This paper presents an extension to Bitcoin's script language enabling covenants, a primitive that allows transactions to restrict how the value they transfer is used in the future. Covenants expand the set of financial instruments expressible in Bitcoin, and enable new powerful and novel use cases. We illustrate two novel security constructs built using covenants.
   The first, vaults, focuses on improving the security of private cryptographic keys. Historically, maintaining these keys securely and reliably has been a critical vulnerability for Bitcoin users. We show how covenants enable vaults, which disincentivize key theft by preventing an attacker from gaining full access to stolen funds.
   The second construct, poison transactions, is a generally useful mechanism for penalizing double-spending attacks. Bitcoin-NG, a protocol that has been recently proposed to improve Bitcoin's throughput, latency and overall scalability, requires this feature. We show how covenants enable poison transactions, and detail how Bitcoin-NG can be implemented progressively as an overlay on top of the Bitcoin blockchain.

AB The emergence of blockchain 2.0 technology enables novel agile business networking collaborations for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO). Smart contracts are enactable by service-oriented cloud computing and blockchain technology for governing DAOs that engage in business collaborations. The distributed governance infrastructure (DGI) for such governance involves an ecosystem of agents, policies, services, and so on. To the best of our knowledge, a formal investigation of the lifecycle for establishing such a DGI has not been explored so far. This paper fills the gap by establishing a formalized DGI intended for the enactment of smart contracts for electronic communities of DAOs. The evaluation of the DGI-lifecycle is performed by means of model checking and discussing what pre-existing systems and also by means of discussing what pre-existing solutions exist for an application-system implementation.

AB Recently, proof of space (PoS) has been suggested as a more egalitarian alternative to the traditional hash-based proof of work. In PoS, a prover proves to a verifier that it has dedicated some specified amount of space. A closely related notion is memory-hard functions (MHF), functions that require a lot of memory/space to compute. While making promising progress, existing PoS and MHF have several problems. First, there are large gaps between the desired space-hardness and what can be proven. Second, it has been pointed out that PoS and MHF should require a lot of space not just at some point, but throughout the entire computation/protocol; few proposals considered this issue. Third, the two existing PoS constructions are both based on a class of graphs called superconcentrators, which are either hard to construct or add a logarithmic factor overhead to efficiency. In this paper, we construct PoS from stacked expander graphs. Our constructions are simpler, more efficient and have tighter provable space-hardness than prior works. Our results also apply to a recent MHF called Balloon hash. We show Balloon hash has tighter space-hardness than previously believed and consistent space-hardness throughout its computation.

AB The power of linear and affine logic lies in their ability to model state change. However, in a trustless, peer-to-peer setting, it is difficult to force principals to commit to state changes. We show how to solve the peer-to-peer affine commitment problem using a generalization of Bitcoin in which transactions deal in types rather than numbers. This has applications to proof-carrying authorization and mechanically executable contracts. Importantly, our system can be-and is-implemented on top of the existing Bitcoin network, so there is no need to recruit computing power to a new protocol.

TI Psychometric Qualities of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality
   Pathology - Short Form for Adolescents
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHOLOGY
AB Background: A growing body of research recognizes the occurrence and validity of personality pathology during adolescence as well as its relevance as a developmental precursor of adult personality pathology.
   Objective: The present study recognizes the need for a comprehensive and concise instrument to assess the dimensions of personality pathology in adolescents. Therefore, the psychometric qualities of an abbreviated version of the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology - Basic Questionnaire for Adolescents (DAPP-BQ-A), which has been denoted as the DAPP - Short Form for Adolescents (DAPP-SF-A), were examined.
   Method: The factorial structure, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discriminative validity, and classification accuracy of the DAPP-SF-A scales were examined in three samples: 1596 non-referred adolescents; 166 adolescents referred to inpatient and outpatient mental health services; and 58 referred and general population adolescents. Results: Despite a reduction in the number of items by 50% (from 290 to 144 items), the promising psychometric qualities established for the DAPP-BQ-A were replicated for the DAPP-SF-A.
   Conclusions: The results of this study are promising regarding the qualities of the DAPP-SF-A and its utility in both clinical and research settings. In addition, the equivalence of the instruments for adolescents and (young) adults enables the investigation of developmental trajectories across different life stages.

TI Synthesis of polybutadienes with controllable microstructure by a novel

SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE
AB The polymerization of 1,3-butadiene was examined by using a novel halogen-free neodymium m-nitrobenzenesulfonate (Nd(3-NBSO3)(3)center dot donors)/alkylaluminum binary catalyst system. The catalyst showed fairly high activity and controllable selectivity. The microstructure of the resultant polymer was adjustable by variation of electron donor and/or the alkylaluminum. C-13-NMR and thermal analysis demonstrate that the produced polybutadienes have stereo-block chain structures of cis-1,4 and trans-1,4 segments with adjustable T (m) and T (c). The neodymium sulfonate-based catalyst is believed to be significant in regulating the chain structure of polydienes and in exploring 1,3-diene polymerization mechanism.

To do so, we explain how to employ an ECDSA adaption of the two-party signature protocol by MacKenzie and Reiter (2004) in the context of Bitcoin and present a prototypic implementation of a Bitcoin wallet that offers both: two-factor authentication and verification over a separate channel. Since we use a smart phone as the second authentication factor, our solution can be used with hardware already available to most users and the user experience is quite similar to the existing online banking authentication methods.

AB The invention of the Bitcoin protocol has opened the door to new forms of financial interaction. One such form may be to adapt Bitcoin technology for use as a community currency. A community currency is a form of money issued by a non-government entity to serve the economic or social interests of a group of people, often in a small geographic area. We propose a model of a community cryptocurrency that includes a community fund from which community members may take out loans if the community votes to approve them. We consider possible vulnerabilities and mitigations to issues that would affect this community fund, including issues of identity, voting protocols and funds management. We conclude that these vulnerabilities are, in most cases, amenable to technological mitigations that must be adaptable to both community values and changing conditions, emphasizing the need for careful currency design.

TI Critical analysis of counter mode with cipher block chain message
   authentication mode protocol-CCMP
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB CCM/CCMP is a two-cycle authenticate and encrypt (AE) mode. One cycle is used to perform confidentiality computations, and the second cycle is used to compute authenticity and integrity. CCM/CCMP is also a generic composition. CCM/CCMP is actually made up of two separate modes, CBC-MAC and AES counter mode amalgamated together. Although CCM/CCMP is an AE mode, it is not an authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) mode. Previous research has suggested that it is a major deficiency for an AE mode not to be an AEAD. Previous critiques of the CCM/CCMP have shown that CBC-MAC and AES counter mode were poorly amalgamated to create the CCM/CCMP. They also showed that CCMP, which was ratified by the IEEE 802.11i workgroup in 2003 and implemented in WPA2, has some security issues. It also has some major efficiency and complexity issues. This research work reviewed the current major AE and AEAD modes such as the Galois counter mode, and the encryption system with keyed integrity and managed oracle and used critical analysis and statistical analysis approaches to identify more deficiencies in the CCM/CCMP.

SO LIQUID CRYSTALS
AB Glass transition temperature (T-g), an important parameter of polymer, was reported to have great influence on the electro-optical properties of polymer dispersed liquid crystals (PDLCs). In this study, macroinitiators with different T-g were synthesised by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerisation, and used to prepare PDLCs with different T-g block chains. The effect of different T-g of the block chains on response times was investigated. It was found that rise time decreased and decay time increased with the decrease of the block chain's T-g. We proposed a possible mechanism by which T-g of the block chains influence response times.

AB Online Social Networks (OSNs) enjoy high popularity, but their centralized architectures lead to intransparency and mistrust in the providers who can be the single point of failure. A solution is to adapt the OSN functionality to an underlying and fully distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) substrate. Several approaches in the field of OSNs based on P2P architectures have been proposed, but they share substantial P2P weaknesses and they suffer from low availability and privacy problems. In this work, we propose a distributed OSN which combines an underlying P2P architecture with friend-based data propagation and a Proof-of-Work (PoW) concept. ProofBook provides availability of user data, stability of the underlying network architecture and privacy improvements while it does not limit simple data sharing based on social relations.

AB Zerocoin proposed adding decentralized cryptographically anonymous e-cash to Bitcoin. Given the increasing popularity of Bitcoin and its reliance on a distributed pseudononymous public ledger, this anonymity is important if only to provide the same minimal privacy protections from nosy neighbors offered by conventional banking. Unfortunately, at 25 KB, the non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for spending a zerocoin are nearly prohibitively large. In this paper, we consider several improvements. First, we strengthen Zerocoin's anonymity guarantees, making them independent of the size of these proofs. Given this freedom, we explore several techniques for drastically reducing proof size while ensuring that forging a single zerocoin is more difficult than the block mining process used to maintain Bitcoin's distributed ledger. Provided a zerocoin is worth less than the reward for a Bitcoin block, forging a coin is not an economically rational action. Hence we preserve Zerocoin's absolute anonymity guarantees while achieving drastic reductions in proof size by limiting ourselves to security against rational attackers.

We propose five principles for designing systems to produce robust evidence. We apply these principles to other systems such as Bitcoin, electronic banking and phone payment apps. We finally propose specific modifications to EMV that could allow disputes to be resolved more efficiently and fairly.

TI Specific recognition of supercoiled plasmid DNA by affinity

SO JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL
   AND LIFE SCIENCES
AB Small molecules that bind DNA with high specificity present a promising opportunity for application as chromatographic ligands for plasmid DNA (pDNA) purification. This research used the intercalator 3,8-diamino-6-phenylphenanthridine (DAPP) as an immobilized ligand for the specific separation of supercoiled (sc) pDNA by affinity chromatography. The results showed that the protonated DAPP-Sepharose support has a great affinity for sc pDNA isoform, separating it from the less active open circular and linear isoforms. All pDNA isoforms were retained in the column using 10 mM acetate buffer pH 5. Selective elution of oc and linear isoforms was achieved with 0.22 M of sodium chloride in the same buffer. Finally, increasing the concentration to 0.55 M led to the elution of the sc isoform. The binding of pDNA to DAPP-Sepharose varies in function of pH, and the stability of the protonated DAPP-DNA complex decreases with increasing salt concentration. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB Dependability in cloud computing applications can be negatively affected by various attacks or service abuses. To come ahead of this threat, we propose an economic measure to deter attacks and various service abuses in cloud computing applications. Our proposed defense is based on requiring a service user to pay a small deposit, using digital currency, before invoking the service. Once they are done using the service, and there has been no detected abuse or attack, the deposit is paid back by the service provider to the service user. If an attack or an abuse is detected, the service user is not paid back and the service provider gets to keep the deposit. We propose the use of micropayments with a decentralized nature and small transaction fees, such as the Bitcoin digital currency. Moreover, thanks to the existence of money exchanges which convert the Bitcoin currency to real world currency, service providers can recoup loses when they exchange the confiscated deposits for real world currency.

TI Further evidence for the fifth higher trait of personality pathology: A
   correlation study using normal and disordered personality measures
SO PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH
AB Studies between disordered personality and the Big-Five or the Alternative Five-Factor model of normal personality have consistently shown four higher traits. The fifth higher trait, relating to Openness to Experience or Impulsive Sensation Seeking was less supported. The culture-free Nonverbal Personality Questionnaire (NPQ) might help us to characterise the fifth higher trait. We therefore tried the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology (DAPP), the NEO-Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R), the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) and the NPQ in 253 healthy participants. Our results yielded five factors, four of which resembled the previous ones. The fifth one, namely Peculiarity Seeking, was defined by NPQ and NEO-PI-R Openness to Experience, ZKPQ Impulsive Sensation Seeking and DAPP Stimulus Seeking. Whether the fifth factor is linked to the schizotypal personality disorder as proposed remains unanswered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Evaluation of the effect of plant sterols on the intestinal processing
   of cholesterol using an in vitro lipolysis model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS
AB An in vitro lipolysis model was utilized to study the effect of stigmastanol (lipophilic phytosterol) and disodium ascorbyl phytostanol phosphate (DAPP) (modified hydrophilic phytostanol) on intestinal processing of cholesterol to gain further understanding of their cholesterol lowering mechanism. Lipolysis results showed that stigmastanol, if given in powder alone, had no effect on cholesterol processing probably due to its poor solubility. Stigmastanol suspension formulation re-distributed cholesterol from aqueous phase to oil and sediment phases. The water soluble DAPP has changed cholesterol distribution even more significantly by transferring cholesterol from aqueous phase to sediment phase. Moreover, the results provided evidence that DAPP inhibited triglyceride digestion in vitro. Considering DAPP as a surfactant with the same lipophilic sterol ring as bile salt, its ability to inhibit triglyceride lipolysis may be due to its competition with bile salt for the substrate surface, thereby hindering the lipolysis of triglyceride and inhibiting cholesterol solubilization with the lipolysis products. It can be speculated that the cholesterol lowering mechanism of DAPP during intestinal digestion is related to its ability to act as a surfactant closely resembling bile salt. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper addresses the simulation of the effects on a high-speed data link of external factors due to fabrication tolerances or uncertain loading conditions. The proposed strategy operates in the frequency domain and amounts to generating a suitable set of stochastic models for the different blocks in which the data link can be decomposed. Each model is based on the expansion of the block chain parameter matrix in terms of orthogonal polynomials. This method turns out to be accurate and more efficient than alternative solutions like the Monte Carlo method in determining the system response sensitivity to parameters variability. The advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated via the stochastic simulation of a PCB application example.

AB Aloein which is the active compounds that decrease pain and inflammation and stimulate skin growth and repair are selected as the model drug in this work. From the low content of active compound (< 5 % v/v) in Aloe-vera, the development of controlled Aloe-vera extraction system is required to increase the efficiency of drug therapeutic. The development of control-released Aloe-vera extraction, aloein from polyacrylamide hydrogel system as transdermal drug delivery patch was studied. The apparent diffusion coefficients, Dapp, hydrogel pore size and the release mechanisms of aloein from aloein/polyacrylamide hydrogels (aloein/PAAM) were investigated in the effect of crosslinking ratio of hydrogel. The pore size of crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel increases with decreasing amount of crosslinker. The amount of aloin release and Dapp increase with increasing hydrogel pore size.

TI Factors affecting apparent N-15 fractionation during nitrogen
   mineralisation in soils with different root litter inputs
SO SOIL RESEARCH
AB Nitrogen-15 ( N-15) fractionation during N mineralisation is frequently invoked to interpret data of N cycling in N-isotope-based ecosystem studies. Because direct measurement of actual fractionation (Dact) is difficult to perform, it is currently estimated from laboratory or field incubation experiments (apparent fractionation, Dapp). However, the procedure of calculation may induce bias in the estimations due to several factors controlled by litter inputs. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of litter inputs and the size and N-15 content of organic N fractions on Dapp. Laboratory incubations were performed using soils receiving different amount of root litter from legume trees and grass in an agroforestry plot. The N-15 contents of organic N and mineralised N were determined. The results were interpreted with a 'three-N' pool model considering two labile organic N pools derived from litter of the tree and the grass, and a recalcitrant organic N pool comprising organic N in mineral soil. The model was used to explore mechanisms that could explain the Dapp obtained in the incubation experiment. Model simulations well duplicated the observed relationships between organic N, mineralised N, their N-15 content, and Dapp. Dapp varied from 1.2% to 2.4%. It was negatively correlated with the distance from trees (R-2 = 0.91, P < 0.05) and positively correlated with total organic N (R-2 = 0.81, P < 0.05). Model simulations indicated that these correlations did not reflect a control of N-15 fractionation, but were an artefact induced by the higher decomposition rate of the labile organic N depleted in N-15. This induced an overestimation of N-15 fractionation that varied from 10% to 55%. Our results indicated that the procedure currently applied to estimate N-15 fractionation during mineralisation may induce large overestimations depending upon the amount of litter input, and the size and N-15 content of the organic N pools.

AB The validity of the Axis II Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) category and its position within the Cluster C personality disorder (PDs) section of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, APA 2000) continues to be a source of much debate The present study examines the associations between general and maladaptive personality traits and OCPD symptoms, prior to and after controlling for co-occumng PD variance, in a general population sample of 274 Flemish adolescents and further explores the incremental validity of two different maladaptive trait measures beyond general traits The results demonstrate that the number of (general and maladaptive) personality-OCPD associations decreases after controlling for a general personality pathology factor, with the FFM factor Conscientiousness and its maladaptive counterpart Compulsivity as remaining correlates of OCPD The findings further suggest to complement the general NEO-PI-R (Costa and McCrae 1992) scales with more maladaptive Items to enable a more comprehensive description of personality pathology variance Implications for understanding and assessing OCPD in the developmental context of adolescence are discussed

CL Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB Fog computing is a new computing paradigm that can provide flexible resources and services at the edge of network. It is an extension of cloud computing and usually cooperated with cloud computing. Therefore, end users, fog nodes, and cloud servers can form a three-layer service model in practical application. In this model, they should have an agreement on a service contract, which contains every party's rights and obligations before the beginning of the service. However, due to lack of trust, it will suffer from some fairness problems during signing a service contract. Contract signing protocol allows two or more mutual distrust entities to sign a predefined digital contract in a fair and effective way. In this paper, we propose a fair three-party contract signing protocol based on the primitive of blockchain, which can be applied to the scenario of fog computing. Our proposed construction allows the participants to sign a contract in a fair way without the involvement of an arbitrator. Moreover, the privacy of the contract content can be preserved on the public chain. Finally, we realize the proposed protocol through the private blockchain and provide the experimental simulation that analyzes the efficiency and effectiveness.

TI Blockchain and more - Algorithm driven food traceability
SO FOOD CONTROL
AB Food safety and quality assurance has become increasingly difficult in times of growing global flows of goods. In particular, the traceability of food turns out to be very challenging for retailers, resellers and state surveillance authorities. The reasons for this range from the proof of simple, but harmless modifications to the detection of health-endangering substances, bacteria or viruses. In addition, it concerns the verification of food authenticity, for example the correct declaration of the geographical origin, variety or cultivation. Such quality parameters justify higher prices and therefore, they are often in the focus of food fraudsters. Some of those qualities can be monitored by objective analytical methods, but not all of them. For ensuring the traceability of food trade networks blockchain algorithms incorporate a high potential, as data can be stored in an unmodifiable way and enabling quick tracking across all process steps, so that stakeholders as well as commodities or semi-finished items can be identified much faster. Areas of applications on one hand and limitations on the other hand are discussed in this review article and reflected with alternative strategies.

TI The intraday dynamics of bitcoin
SO RESEARCH IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND FINANCE
AB Bitcoin has received much investor attention in recent years and following this, there has been an explosion of academic studies examining this new financial asset. We contribute to the growing literature of Bitcoin by examining the intraday variables of the leading Bitcoin exchange with the highest information share over 4 years' worth of data to reveal the intraday stylized facts of Bitcoin and how they have developed over time. Employing GMT-timestamped tick data aggregated to the 5-mintuely frequency, we find that Bitcoin returns have increased over time, while trading volume, volatility and liquidity varied substantially over time. We also find that volume increases throughout the day and falls from around 4 pm until midnight, which is consistent with the intraday patterns found in currency markets. Realised volatility is fairly consistent throughout the day although it is highest during the opening times of the three major global stock markets. Also liquidity is highest during the opening times of the major global exchanges and the markets tend to be illiquid during the early morning. Finally, we show evidence of the mixture of distribution hypothesis of Clark (1973).

TI Blockchain and supply chain relations: A transaction cost theory
   perspective
SO JOURNAL OF PURCHASING AND SUPPLY MANAGEMENT
AB Blockchain is projected to be the latest revolutionary technology and is gaining increasing attention from academics and practitioners. Blockchain is essentially a distributed and immutable database that enables more efficient and transparent transactions. The consensus-based record validation can eliminate the need for a trusted intermediary. We utilize the transaction cost theory to create a better understanding of how blockchain might influence supply chain relations, specifically in terms of transaction costs and governance decisions. Conceptually developing a set of six propositions, we argue that blockchain limits opportunistic behavior, the impact of environmental and behavioral uncertainty. Blockchain reduces transaction costs, as it allows for transparent and valid transactions. We explore several areas for future research on how blockchain might shape supply chain management in the future.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS
AB The prevalence of distributed energy resources encourages the concept of an electricity "Prosumer (Producer and Consumer)". This paper proposes a distributed electricity trading system to facilitate the peer-to-peer electricity sharing among prosumers. The proposed system includes two layers. In the first layer, a multi-agent system is designed to support the prosumer network, and an agent coalition mechanism is proposed to enable the prosumers to form coalitions and negotiate electricity trading. In the second layer, a Blockchain based transaction settlement mechanism is proposed to enable the trusted and secure settlement of electricity trading transactions formed in the first layer. Simulations are conducted based on the java agent development environment to validate the proposed electricity trading process.

TI A Survey and Evaluation of the Potentials of Distributed Ledger
   Technology for Peer-to-Peer Transactive Energy Exchanges in Local Energy
   Markets
SO IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB The unpredictability and intermittency introduced by Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in power systems may lead to unforeseen peaks of energy production, which might differ from energy demand. To manage these mismatches, a proper communication between prosumers (i.e., users with RESs that can either inject or absorb energy) and active users (i.e., users that agree to have their loads changed according to the system needs) is required. To achieve this goal, the centralized approach used in traditional power systems is no longer possible because both prosumers and active users would like to take part in energy transactions, and a decentralized approach based on transactive energy systems (TESs) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy transactions should be adopted. In this context, the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), based on the blockchain concept arises as the most promising solution to enable smart contracts between prosumers and active users, which are safely guarded in blocks with cryptographic hashes. The aim of this paper is to provide a review about the deployment of decentralized TESs and to propose and discuss a transactive management infrastructure. In this context, the concept of Proof of Energy is proposed as a novel consensus protocol for P2P energy exchanges managed by DLT. An application of the proposed infrastructure considering a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) aggregator and residential prosumers endowed with a new transactive controller to manage the electrical storage system is discussed.

TI Agile manufacturing: an evolutionary review of practices
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
AB Academics and practitioners have long acknowledged the importance of agile manufacturing and related supply chains in achieving firm sustainable competitiveness. However, limited, if any, research has focused on the evolution of practices within agile manufacturing supply chains and how these are related to competitive performance objectives. To address this gap, we reviewed the literature on an agile manufacturing drawing on the evolution of manufacturing agility, attributes of agile manufacturing, the drivers of agile manufacturing, and the identification of the enabling competencies deployable for agile manufacturing. Our thesis is that agile manufacturing is at the centre of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage, especially in light of current unprecedented market instability coupled with complex customer requirements. In this regard, the emphasis which agile manufacturing places on responsive adaptability would counter the destabilising influence of competitive pressures on organisations performance criteria. We have identified five enabling competencies as the agility enablers and practices of agile manufacturing, that is, transparent customisation, agile supply chains, intelligent automation, total employee empowerment and technology integration, and further explored their joint deployment to create positive multiplier effects. Future research directions were also provided with respect to the operationalisation of the five identified enablers and the potential for emergent technologies of big data, blockchain, and Internet of Things to shape future agile manufacturing practices.

A hierarchical framework is first proposed for the energy demand side management through peer-to-peer exchange of energy information in the real-time market. The heterogeneity of demand flexibility associated with different types of users is reflected in the framework with inter-sectorial interactions modelled by a non-cooperative game. The inherent uncertainty of renewable generation is also considered with the technique of receding horizon optimization. Subsequently, smart contracts and decentralized identifier guaranteed by blockchain technologies are implemented to create a seamless, secured and efficient distributed energy system. Finally, a Singapore-based case study is conducted and the results show that with effective interactions among participants, electricity consumption of the entire energy system closely tracks the generation pattern of renewable resources, resulting in a significantly flattened schedule of grid electricity procurement.

SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems are paving their path for a revolutionized world in which majority of our objects of everyday use will be interconnected. These objects will be able to link and communicate with each other and their surroundings in order to automate majority of our tasks. This interconnection of IoT nodes require security, seamless authentication, robustness and easy maintenance services. In order to provide such salient features, blockchain comes out as a viable solution. The decentralized nature of blockchain has resolved many security, maintenance, and authentication issues of IoT systems. Therefore, an immense increase in applications of blockchain-based IoT systems can be seen from the past few years. However, blockchain-based IoT network is public, so transactional details and encrypted keys are open and visible to everybody in that network. Thus, any adversary can infer critical information of users from this public infrastructure. In this paper, we discuss the privacy issues caused due to integration of blockchain in IoT applications by focusing over the applications of our daily use. Furthermore, we discuss implementation of five privacy preservation strategies in blockchain-based IoT systems named as anonymization, encryption, private contract, mixing, and differential privacy. Finally, we discuss challenges, and future directions for research in privacy preservation of blockchain-based IoT systems. This paper can serve as a basis of development of future privacy preservation strategies to address several privacy problems of IoT systems operating over blockchain. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Efficient and privacy-preserving traceable attribute-based encryption in
   blockchain
SO ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB Attribute-based encryption, especially ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, plays an important role in the data sharing. In the process of data sharing, the secret key does not contain the specific information of users, who may share his secret key with other users for benefits without being discovered. In addition, the attribute authority can generate the secret key from any attribute set. If the secret key is abused, it is difficult to judge whether the abused private key comes from users or the attribute authority. Besides, the access control structure usually leaks sensitive information in a distributed network, and the efficiency of attribute-based encryption is a bottleneck of its applications. Fortunately, blockchain technology can guarantee the integrity and non-repudiation of data. In view of the above issues, an efficient and privacy-preserving traceable attribute-based encryption scheme is proposed. In the proposed scheme, blockchain technologies are used to guarantee both integrity and non-repudiation of data, and the ciphertext can be quickly generated by using the pre-encryption technology. Moreover, attributes are hidden in anonymous access control structures by using the attribute bloom filter. When a secret key is abused, the source of the abused secret key can be audited. Security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme is secure and efficient.

TI The Carbon Footprint of Bitcoin
SO JOULE
AB Participation in the Bitcoin blockchain validation process requires specialized hardware and vast amounts of electricity, which translates into a significant carbon footprint. Here, we demonstrate a methodology for estimating the power consumption associated with Bitcoin's blockchain based on IPO filings of major hardware manufacturers, insights on mining facility operations, and mining pool compositions. We then translate our power consumption estimate into carbon emissions, using the localization of IP addresses. We determine the annual electricity consumption of Bitcoin, as of November 2018, to be 45.8 TWh and estimate that annual carbon emissions range from 22.0 to 22.9 MtCO(2). This means that the emissions produced by Bitcoin sit between the levels produced by the nations of Jordan and Sri Lanka, which is comparable to the level of Kansas City. With this article, we aim to gauge the external costs of Bitcoin and inform the broader debate on the costs and benefits of cryptocurrencies.

TI Bitcoin price forecasting with neuro-fuzzy techniques
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH
AB Cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin being the most notable example, have attracted considerable attention in recent years, and they have experienced large fluctuations in their price. While a few studies employ conventional statistical and econometric approaches to reveal the driving factors of Bitcoin's prices, research on the development of forecasting models to be used as decision support tools in investment strategies is scarce. This study proposes a computational intelligence technique that uses a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy controller, namely PATSOS, to forecast the direction in the change of the daily price of Bitcoin. The proposed methodology outperforms two other computational intelligence models, the first being developed with a simpler neuro-fuzzy approach, and the second being developed with artificial neural networks. Furthermore, the investment returns achieved by a trading simulation, based on the signals of the proposed model, are 71.21% higher than the ones achieved through a naive buy-and-hold strategy. The performance of the PATSOS system is robust to the use of other cryptocurrencies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain-Based Scalable and Tamper-Evident Solution for Registering
   Energy Data
SO SENSORS
AB Nowadays, it has been recognized that blockchain can provide the technological infrastructure for developing decentralized, secure, and reliable smart energy grid management systems. However, an open issue that slows the adoption of blockchain technology in the energy sector is the low scalability and high processing overhead when dealing with the real-time energy data collected by smart energy meters. Thus, in this paper, we propose a scalable second tier solution which combines the blockchain ledger with distributed queuing systems and NoSQL (Not Only SQL database) databases to allow the registration of energy transactions less frequently on the chain without losing the tamper-evident benefits brought by the blockchain technology. At the same time, we propose a technique for tamper-evident registration of smart meters' energy data and associated energy transactions using digital fingerprinting which allows the energy transaction to be linked hashed-back on-chain, while the sensors data is stored off-chain. A prototype was implemented using Ethereum and smart contracts for the on-chain components while for the off-chain components we used Cassandra database and RabbitMQ messaging broker. The prototype proved to be effective in managing a settlement of energy imbalances use-case and during the evaluation conducted in simulated environment shows promising results in terms of scalability, throughput, and tampering of energy data sampled by smart energy meters.

TI Cryptocurrency market contagion: Market uncertainty, market complexity,
   and dynamic portfolios
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL MARKETS INSTITUTIONS & MONEY
AB In this study, we employ a TVP-FAVAR connectedness approach in order to investigate the transmission mechanism in the cryptocurrency market. To this end, we concentrate on the top 9 cryptocurrencies by virtue of market capitalization and one market factor - based on 45 additional digital currencies - capturing the co-movements in the cryptocurrency market. The period of study spans between August 7, 2015 and May 31, 2018. We find that the dynamic total connectedness across several cryptocurrencies exhibits large dynamic variability ranging between 25% and 75%. In particular, periods of high (low) market uncertainty correspond to strong (weak) connectedness. We show that these results could be explained on the basis of increased market uncertainty that is associated with periods of highly volatile prices. In addition, despite the fact that Bitcoin still influences the cryptocurrency market substantially, we note that, recently, Ethereum has become the number one net transmitting cryptocurrency. We further note that the market gradually becomes more complex considering our connectedness approach and that this might be attributed to the unique characteristics and possibilities inherent in the technology of each cryptocurrency. A simplified application concentrating on bivariate portfolios is indicative of potential hedging opportunities using dynamic hedge ratios and dynamic portfolio weights. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Price discovery in bitcoin spot or futures?
SO JOURNAL OF FUTURES MARKETS
AB In December 2017, both the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange introduced futures contracts on bitcoin. We investigate to what extent they provide useful information for the price discovery of bitcoin. We rely on the information share methodology of Hasbrouck (1995, J Finance, 50, pp. 1175-1199) and Gonzalo and Granger (1995, J Bus Econ Stat, 13, pp. 27-35) and find that the spot price leads the futures price. We attribute this result to the higher trading volume and the longer trading hours of the globally distributed bitcoin spot market, compared to the relatively restricted access to the US-based futures markets.

TI An intelligent and secure smart watering system using fuzzy logic and
   blockchain
SO COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
AB An intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) is presented in this paper that is assisted with an Android application for smart consumption of water in small are medium-scale garden and fields. The proposed system banks on a set of accessible and economical sensors that capture real-time data of plants and environment conditions such as Soil Moisture Level, Light Intensity, air humidity, air temperature, etc. Once the data is collected from sensors on a server, the proposed SWS processes the data to decide about the watering schedule using Block-chain and Fuzzy Logic approach. Here, Fuzzy Logic approach helps in taking smart decisions with respect to watering requirements and Block-chain provides the required security in IoT enabled system by allowing only the trusted devices to access and manage the proposed SWS. In our approach, Blockchain technology plays an important role by providing scalability, privacy, and reliability in the proposed IoT base smart system. The multiple users and devices can be involved in monitoring and interacting remotely with plants by using Smart Watering System (SWS) (prototype) application that is developed in Android. Once the Fuzzy Logic based system decides the action on the bases of values of the input variables, the SWS activates the actuators to take watering actions such as turning water tunnels ON/OFF in periodical manner. The results of the proposed system show that it is efficient and secure application to efficiently handle the watering process of plants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Shock transmission in the cryptocurrency market. Is Bitcoin the most
   influential?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB The growing cryptocurrency market has attracted the attention from many investors worldwide, mainly due to the ease of entering the market and its extremely volatile character. The main aim of this paper is to examine interdependencies between log-returns of cryptocurrencies, with the special focus on Bitcoin. Based on implications from the literature, we use methods dedicated for studying the stock market and apply the two-step analysis, comparing results between two subsequent periods. Results obtained using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) method show that cryptocurrencies form hierarchical clusters, consistently over two separate periods, indicating potential topological properties of the cryptocurrency market. Then, using Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, we study the transmission of demand shocks within clusters. Results show that changes in Bitcoin price do not affect and are not affected by changes in prices of other cryptocurrencies. However, results indicate that findings obtained for Bitcoin shall not be generalized to the entire cryptocurrency market.

TI Blockchain technology: implications for operations and supply chain
   management
SO SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose This paper aims to encourage the study of blockchain technology from an operations and supply chain management (OSCM) perspective, identifying potential areas of application, and to provide an agenda for future research. Design/methodology/approach An explanation and analysis of blockchain technology is provided to identify implications for the field of OSCM. Findings The hype around the opportunities that digital ledger technologies offer is high. For OSCM, a myriad of ways in which blockchain could transform practice are identified, including enhancing product safety and security; improving quality management; reducing illegal counterfeiting; improving sustainable supply chain management; advancing inventory management and replenishment; reducing the need for intermediaries; impacting new product design and development; and reducing the cost of supply chain transactions. The immature state of practice and research surrounding blockchain means there is an opportunity for OSCM researchers to study the technology in its early stages and shape its adoption.
   Originality/value This is one of the first papers in a leading international OSCM journal to analyse blockchain technology, thereby complementing a recent article on digital supply chains that omitted blockchain.

AB We study which variables can explain and predict the return, volatility and trading volume of Bitcoin. The considered variables are return, volatility, trading volume, transaction volume, change in the number of unique Bitcoin addresses, the VIX index and Google searches for "Bitcoin". We use realized volatility calculated from high-frequency data and find that the heterogeneous autoregressive model is suitable for Bitcoin volatility. Trading volume further improves this volatility model. The trading volume of Bitcoin can be predicted from Google searches for "Bitcoin". However, none of the considered variables can predict Bitcoin returns.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB The price behavior of cryptocurrencies relative to conventional currencies remains relatively understudied, despite some attempts that consider the Bitcoin market. This study examines long-range cross-correlations and asymmetric multifractality between leading conventional currencies (Swiss Franc, Euro, British Pound, Yen, and Australian dollar) and main cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, and Dash) from June 2, 2014 to February 28, 2018. Empirical results show evidence of a significant asymmetric characteristic from the cross-correlation, that is found to be persistent and multifractal in most of the cases. Bitcoin and Litecoin are the cryptocurrencies that exhibit the most multifractal behavior, whereas Monero and Ripple generally exhibit lower multifractal behavior. All cryptocurrencies exhibit a slightly lower asymmetry for longer terms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI A Blockchain and AutoML Approach for Open and Automated Customer Service
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Customer service is transforming from traditional manual service toward automated service, which utilizes different computational informatics to achieve a higher efficient and quality services. Automated customer service requires big data and expertise in data analysis as prerequisites. However, many companies, especially small and medium enterprises, do not have sufficient data and experience due to their limited scale and resources. They need to rely on third parties, and this reliance results in the lack of development of core customer service competency. In order to overcome these challenges, an open and automated customer service platform based on Internet of things (IoT), blockchain, and automated machine learning (AutoML) is proposed. The data are gathered with the use of IoT devices during the customer service. An open but secured environment to achieve data trading is ensured by using blockchain. AutoML is adopted to automate the data analysis processes for reducing the reliance of costly experts. The proposed platform is analyzed through use case evaluation. A prototype system has also been developed and evaluated. The simulation results show that our platform is scalable and efficient.

TI Blockchain-Enabled Data Collection and Sharing for Industrial IoT With
   Deep Reinforcement Learning
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB With the rapid development of smart mobile terminals (MTs), various industrial Internet of things (IIoT) applications can fully leverage them to collect and share data for providing certain services. However, two key challenges still remain. One is how to achieve high-quality data collection with limited MT energy resource and sensing range. Another is how to ensure security when sharing and exchanging data among MTs, to prevent possible device failure, network communication failure, malicious users or attackers, etc. To this end, we propose a blockchain-enabled efficient data collection and secure sharing scheme combining Ethereum blockchain and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to create a reliable and safe environment. In this scheme, DRL is used to achieve the maximum amount of collected data, and the blockchain technology is used to ensure security and reliability of data sharing. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can provide higher security level and stronger resistance to attack than a traditional database based data sharing scheme for different levels/types of attacks.

TI Performance Optimization for Blockchain-Enabled Industrial Internet of

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Recent advances in the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide plenty of opportunities for various industries. To address the security and efficiency issues of the massive IIoT data, blockchain is widely considered as a promising solution to enable data storing/processing/sharing in a secure and efficient way. To meet the high throughput requirement, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IIoT systems, the goals of which are threefold: 1) providing a methodology for evaluating the system from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency, and security; 2) improving the scalability of the underlying blockchain without affecting the system's decentralization, latency, and security; and 3) designing a modulable blockchain for IIoT systems, where the block producers, consensus algorithm, block size, and block interval can be selected/adjusted using the DRL technique. Simulations results show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of blockchain-enabled IIoT systems and well adapt to the dynamics of the IIoT.

We identify dual long memory and structural changes on cryptocurrency markets using four different generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models (e.g., GARCH, FIGARCH, FIAPARCH, and HYGARCH). Furthermore, the persistence level of both returns and volatility decreases after accounting for long memory and switching states. Finally, the FIGARCH model with SB variables provides a comparatively superior forecasting accuracy performance. These findings have significant implications for both cryptocurrency allocations and portfolio management.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a smart factory has entered the booming period. However, as the number of nodes and network size become larger, the traditional IIoT architecture can no longer provide effective support for such enormous system. Therefore, we introduce the Blockchain architecture, which is an emerging scheme for constructing the distributed networks, to reshape the traditional IIoT architecture. First, the major problems of the traditional IIoT architecture are analyzed, and the existing improvements are summarized. Second, we introduce a security and privacy model to help design the Blockchain-based architecture. On this basis, we decompose and reorganize the original IIoT architecture to form a new multicenter partially decentralized architecture. Then, we introduce some relative security technologies to improve and optimize the new architecture. After that we design the data interaction process and the algorithms of the architecture. Finally, we use an automatic production platform to discuss the specific implementation. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture provides better security and privacy protection than the traditional architecture. Thus, the proposed architecture represents a significant improvement of the original architecture, which provides a new direction for the IIoT development.

TI BSIS: Blockchain-Based Secure Incentive Scheme for Energy Delivery in
   Vehicular Energy Network
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Vehicular energy network (VEN), as an important part of the Internet of Things for the smart city, can facilitate the renewable energy (RE) transportation over a large geographical area by means of electric vehicles (EVs) through wireless power transfer technology. However, due to the potential security vulnerability in VEN, EV users can be attacked by external or internal adversaries. In addition, owing to the selfishness of EVs, it is a great challenge to optimally schedule the charging/discharging behaviors of EVs to realize regional energy balance in VEN. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based secure incentive scheme for energy delivery in VEN. First, a novel permissioned energy blockchain system is introduced in VEN to implement secure energy delivery services for EVs and energy nodes through the use of distributed ledgers and cryptocurrency. Second, a proof of reputation consensus protocol is proposed to efficiently reach consensus in energy blockchain, where the reputation derivation is constructed based on the local trust computing and credibility computing. Third, motivated by the pricing mechanism, an incentive model is developed to stimulate EVs to cooperatively deliver RE to various areas with different electricity loads while maximizing EVs' utilities. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided, which demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme through the comparison with conventional schemes.

TI A Blockchain-Enabled Trustless Crowd-Intelligence Ecosystem on Mobile
   Edge Computing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS
AB Crowd intelligence tries to gather, process, infer, and ascertain massive useful information by utilizing the intelligence of crowds or distributed computers, which has great potential in Industrial Internet of Things. A crowd-intelligence ecosystem involves three stakeholders, namely the platform, workers (e.g., individuals, sensors, or processors), and task publisher. The stakeholders have no mutual trust but interest conflict, which means bad cooperation of them. Due to lack of trust, transferring raw data (e.g., pictures or video clips) between publisher and workers requires the remote platform center to serve as a relay node, which implies network congestion. First, we use a reward-penalty model to align the incentives of stakeholders. Then the predefined rules are implemented using blockchain smart contract on many edge servers (ES) of the mobile edge computing network, which together function as a trustless hybrid human-machine crowd-intelligence platform. As ES are near to workers and publisher, network congestion can be effectively improved. Further, we proved the existence of the only one strong Nash equilibrium, which can maximize the interests of involved ES and make the ecosystem bigger. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the proposed method, respectively.

TI Equilibrium analysis of bitcoin block withholding attack: A generalized
   model
SO RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY
AB Block withholding attack is an action where a miner who has found a legal block chooses not to submit it but rather directly abandons it. This attack makes the mining pool lose all bitcoin rewards contained within the block. In this paper, we construct a generalized model where two participants can choose to either cooperate with each other or employ a block withholding attack in the mining pool. To make the model more realistic, we consider both the cost of partial proof of work and the cost of cooperation. We also calculate the reward-per-time instead of profit-per-time to better measure the payoffs of each party. Further, we discuss the case where the payoff function and cost function are directly related to the computational power. The pure strategy and mixed strategy are analyzed respectively and the segmentations of the equilibrium are shown. We demonstrate that increasing the information asymmetry by utilizing information conceal mechanisms could lower the occurrence of the BWH attack.

   recommendations and future directions
SO COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES
AB As the first and last line of defence in many cases, authentication is a crucial part of a system. With authentication, any unauthorised access to the system can be prevented. This work maps the research landscape through two means. The first is a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain technology in authentication over networking. The second is identification of different types of authentication systems under various platforms that use blockchain technology. This work also provides useful and classified information which can enhance the understanding of how various authentication systems can be combined with blockchain technology. In addition, problems associated with this blockchain technology and proposed solutions are surveyed to fulfil the requirements of the network applications. Moreover, this work highlights the importance, capabilities, motivations and challenges of blockchain technology with distinct applications in various fields. Finally, recommendations and future research directions are discussed.

TI A blockchain-based location privacy-preserving crowdsensing system
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB With the support of portable electronic devices and crowdsensing, a new class of mobile applications based on the Internet of Things (IoT) application is emerging. Crowdsensing enables workers with mobile devices to travel to specified locations and collect data, then send it back to the requester for rewards. However, the majority of the existing crowdsensing systems are based on centralized servers, which are prone to a high chance of attack, intrusion, and manipulation. Further, during the process of transmitting information to and from the service server, the worker's location is usually exposed. This raises the potential risk of a privacy infringement. In this paper, we first identify three ways locations can be disclosed in traditional crowdsensing systems. Then, we propose a novel solution, dubbed a blockchain privacy-preservation crowdsensing system, to address these privacy problems. The proposed system not only protects the privacy of worker locations but also increases the success rate of completing the assigned task. Specifically, the system entails a rewards-based task assignment process that, essentially, markets the given assignment and uses the anonymized characteristics of blockchain technology to hide the identity information of users. To prevent attacks through re-identification, we have introduced a private blockchain to distribute the worker's transaction records. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Transformations, transitions, or tall tales? A global review of the
   uptake and impact of NoSQL, blockchain, and big data analytics on the
   land administration sector
SO LAND USE POLICY
AB Unstructured data, non-relational databases, distributed databases, and big data analytics potentially change the landscape for digital land data creation, use, management, and dissemination. The way land data is governed and the resultant impact on land tenure security delivery is open to substantial re-thinking. Drawing from international cases, this paper provides a state-of-the-art examination of prototypes and demonstrators from the global land sector. The aim is to deliver an insight into the opportunities, challenges, impacts, and future scenarios regarding the application of the emerging technologies. The paper finds that whilst uptake of non-relational and distributed databases is occurring, it remains largely at the level of proof-of-concept, demonstrator or pilot. Scaled uptake is occurring slower than anticipated, and to a lesser degree than in other sectors. However, the broader and longer-term impacts on the land sector remain difficult to judge. Meanwhile, emerging distributed analytical databases appear to be under-exploited or at least underexplored within the land sector. Overall, the examined technologies are seen to enable new operational approaches for conventional land sector transactions, and also entirely new land related services, digital products, and actors: the ways and means of holding, transferring, and securing land may become more nuanced, fractionalized, and/or automated. Whether these observed embryonic developments lead to sector transformation or orderly transition, is seen to be heavily reliant on the prevailing political, socio-cultural and institutional settings within a jurisdiction.

TI Security in networks of unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance with
   an agent-based approach inspired by the principles of blockchain
SO AD HOC NETWORKS
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can support surveillance even in areas without network infrastructure. However, UAV networks raise security challenges because of its dynamic topology. This paper proposes a technique for maintaining security in UAV networks in the context of surveillance, by corroborating information about events from different sources. In this way, UAV networks can conform peer-to-peer information inspired by the principles of blockchain, and detect compromised UAVs based on trust policies. The proposed technique uses a secure asymmetric encryption with a pre-shared list of official UAVs. Using this technique, the wrong information can be detected when an official UAV is physically hijacked. The novel agent based simulator ABS-SecurityUAV is used to validate the proposed approach. In our experiments, around 90% of UAVs were able to corroborate information about a person walking in a controlled area, while none of the UAVs corroborated fake information coming from a hijacked UAV.

TI Assessing information diffusion models for influence maximization in
   signed social networks
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB Influence maximization is an important issue in social network analysis domain which concerns finding the most influential nodes. Determining the influential nodes is made with respect to information diffusion models. Most of the existing models only contain trust relationships while distrust exist in social networks as well. There exist some drawbacks in limited studies where distrust relationship is involved. The most outstanding drawback is the lack of assessment on the validity of the schemes presented on how influence propagates through distrust relationships in comparison with real word propagation in social networks. In this paper, two schemes are proposed, where based on each, some new models are proposed in two classes: cascade-based and threshold-based. All models of concern here are evaluated in comparison with the benchmark models through two real data sets, the Epinions and Bitcoin OTC. Results obtained indicate the superiority of one of the proposed schemes: when a distrusted user performs an action or adopts an opinion, the target users may tend not to do it.

TI Proof-of-Familiarity: A Privacy-Preserved Blockchain Scheme for
   Collaborative Medical Decision-Making
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application
   The work facilitates a collaborative medical decision-making scheme among patients, doctors and insurance companies through a blockchain-based architecture.
   Abstract The current healthcare sector is facing difficulty in satisfying the growing issues, expenses, and heavy regulation of quality treatment. Surely, electronic medical records (EMRs) and protected health information (PHI) are highly sensitive, personally identifiable information (PII). However, the sharing of EMRs, enhances overall treatment quality. A distributed ledger (blockchain) technology, embedded with privacy and security by architecture, provides a transparent application developing platform. Privacy, security, and lack of confidence among stakeholders are the main downsides of extensive medical collaboration. This study, therefore, utilizes the transparency, security, and efficiency of blockchain technology to establish a collaborative medical decision-making scheme. This study considers the experience, skill, and collaborative success rate of four key stakeholders (patient, cured patient, doctor, and insurance company) in the healthcare domain to propose a local reference-based consortium blockchain scheme, and an associated consensus gathering algorithm, proof-of-familiarity (PoF). Stakeholders create a transparent and tenable medical decision to increase the interoperability among collaborators through PoF. A prototype of PoF is tested with multichain 2.0, a blockchain implementing framework. Moreover, the privacy of identities, EMRs, and decisions are preserved by two-layer storage, encryption, and a timestamp storing mechanism. Finally, superiority over existing schemes is identified to improve personal data (PII) privacy and patient-centric outcomes research (PCOR).

TI BLA: Blockchain-Assisted Lightweight Anonymous Authentication for
   Distributed Vehicular Fog Services
SO IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
AB As modern vehicles and distributed fog services advance apace, vehicular fog services (VFSs) are being expected to span across multiple geo-distributed datacenters, which inevitably leads to cross-datacenter authentication. Traditional cross-datacenter authentication models are not suitable for the scenario of high-speed moving vehicles accessing VFS, because these models either ignored user privacy or ignored the delay requirement of driving vehicles. This paper proposes a blockchain-assisted lightweight anonymous authentication (BLA) mechanism for distributed VFS, which is provisioned to driving vehicles. BLA can achieve the following advantages: 1) realizing a flexible cross-datacenter authentication, in which a vehicle can decide whether to be reauthenticated or not when it enters a new vehicular fog datacenter; 2) achieving anonymity, and granting vehicle users the responsibility of preserving their privacy; 3) it is lightweight by achieving noninteractivity between vehicles and service managers (SMs), and eliminating the communication between SMs in the authentication process, which significantly reduces the communication delay; and 4) resisting the attack that the database governed by one center is tampered with. BLA achieves these advantages by effectively combining modern cryptographical technology and blockchain technology. These security features are demonstrated by carrying out security analysis. Meanwhile, extensive simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency and practicality of BLA.

TI MedChain: Efficient Healthcare Data Sharing via Blockchain
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Healthcare information exchange is an important research topic, which can benefit both healthcare providers and patients. In healthcare data sharing, many cloud-based solutions have been proposed, but the trustworthiness of a third-party cloud service is questionable. Recently, blockchain has been introduced in healthcare record sharing, which does not rely on trusting a third party. However, existing approaches only focus on the records collected from medical examination. They are not efficient in sharing data streams continuously generated from sensors and other monitoring devices. Today, IoT devices have been widely deployed and sensors and mobile applications can monitor patients' body conditions. The collected data are shared to laboratories and institutions for diagnosis and further study. Moreover, existing approaches are too rigid to efficiently support metadata change. In this paper, an efficient data-sharing scheme is proposed, called MedChain, which combines blockchain, digest chain, and structured P2P network techniques to overcome the above efficiency issues in the existing approaches for sharing both types of healthcare data. Based on MedChain, a session-based healthcare data-sharing scheme is devised, which brings flexibility in data sharing. The evaluation results show that MedChain can achieve higher efficiency and satisfy the security requirements in data sharing.

TI Do bitcoins follow a random walk model?
SO RESEARCH IN ECONOMICS
AB Bitcoins have become a fad among investors despite of the ambiguity surrounding on its nature and characteristics. This study aims to contribute to the existing literature of examining bitcoin returns under a financial asset purview. Through multiple robust tests, the market efficiency of daily bitcoin returns is analyzed for the time frame of July 2010 till March 2018. Strong evidence of market inefficiency characterized by absence of random walk model is found. The market inefficiency was found attributable to the presence of asymmetric volatility clustering. More studies are needed to examine the temporal dynamics of bitcoin returns. (C) 2019 University of Venice. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Blockchain Network Based Topic Mining Process for Cognitive
   Manufacturing
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB Cognitive manufacturing has brought about an innovative change to the 4th industrial revolution based technology in combination with blockchain distributed ledger, which guarantees reliability, safety, and security, and mining-based intelligence information technology. In addition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning technologies are combined in processes for logistics, equipment, distribution, manufacturing, and quality management, so that an optimized intelligent manufacturing system is developed. This study proposes a topic mining process in blockchain-network-based cognitive manufacturing. The proposed method exploits the highly universal Fourier transform algorithm in order to analyze the context information of equipment and human body motion based on a variety of sensor input information in the cognitive manufacturing process. An accelerometer is used to analyze the movement of a worker in the manufacturing process and to measure the state energy of work, movement, rest, and others. Time is split in a certain unit and then a frequency domain is analyzed in real time. For the vulnerable security of smart devices, a side-chain-based distributed consensus blockchain network is utilized. If an event occurs, it is processed according to rules and the blocking of a transaction is saved in a distributed database. In the blockchain network, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) based topic encapsulation is used for the mining process. The improved blockchain distributed ledger is applied to the manufacturing process to distribute the ledger of information in a peer-to-peer blockchain network in order to jointly record and manage the information. Further, topic encapsulation, a formatted statistical inference method to analyze a semantic environment, is designed. Through data mining, the time-series-based sequential pattern continuously appearing in the manufacturing process and the correlations between items in the process are found. In the cognitive manufacturing, an equalization-based LDA method is used for associate-clustering the items with high frequency. In the blockchain network, a meaningful item in the manufacturing step is extracted as a representative topic. In a cognitive manufacturing process, through data mining, potential information is extracted and hidden rules are found. Accordingly, in the cognitive manufacturing process, the mining process makes decision-making possible, especially advanced decision-making, such as potential risk, quality prediction, trend prediction, production monitoring, fault diagnosis, and data distortion.

TI Affordances, experimentation and actualization of FinTech: A blockchain
   implementation study
SO JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Blockchain, the technology underlying bitcoin, is an emerging financial technology (FinTech) that is poised to have strategic impacts on organizations. Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS). Our study can also help IT practitioners to implement blockchain effectively and extract value from their investment.

TI Toward Secure Blockchain-Enabled Internet of Vehicles: Optimizing
   Consensus Management Using Reputation and Contract Theory
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
AB In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), data sharing among vehicles is critical for improving driving safety and enhancing vehicular services. To ensure security and traceability of data sharing, existing studies utilize efficient delegated proof-of-stake consensus scheme as hard security solutions to establish blockchain-enabled IoV (BIoV). However, as the miners are selected from miner candidates by stake-based voting, defending against voting collusion between the candidates and compromised high-stake vehicles becomes challenging. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose a two-stage soft security enhancement solution: 1) miner selection and 2) block verification. In the first stage, we design a reputation-based voting scheme to ensure secure miner selection. This scheme evaluates candidates' reputation using both past interactions and recommended opinions from other vehicles. The candidates with high reputation are selected to be active miners and standby miners. In the second stage, to prevent internal collusion among active miners, a newly generated block is further verified and audited by standby miners. To incentivize the participation of the standby miners in block verification, we adopt the contract theory to model the interactions between active miners and standby miners, where block verification security and delay are taken into consideration. Numerical results based on a real-world dataset confirm the security and efficiency of our schemes for data sharing in BIoV.

TI Are Distributed Ledger Technologies the panacea for food traceability?
SO GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY-AGRICULTURE POLICY ECONOMICS AND ENVIRONMENT
AB Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), such as blockchain, has the potential to transform supply chains. It can provide a cryptographically secure and immutable record of transactions and associated metadata (origin, contracts, process steps, environmental variations, microbial records, etc.) linked across whole supply chains. The ability to trace food items within and along a supply chain is legally required by all actors within the chain. It is critical to food safety, underpins trust and global food trade. However, current food traceability systems are not linked between all actors within the supply chain. Key metadata on the age and process history of a food is rarely transferred when a product is bought and sold through multiple steps within the chain. Herein, we examine the potential of massively scalable DLT to securely link the entire food supply chain, from producer to end user. Under such a paradigm, should a food safety or quality issue ever arise, authorized end users could instantly and accurately trace the origin and history of any particular food item. This novel and unparalleled technology could help underpin trust for the safety of all food, a critical component of global food security. In this paper, we investigate the (i) data requirements to develop DLT technology across whole supply chains, (ii) key challenges and barriers to optimizing the complete system, and (iii) potential impacts on production efficiency, legal compliance, access to global food markets and the safety of food. Our conclusion is that while DLT has the potential to transform food systems, this can only be fully realized through the global development and agreement on suitable data standards and governance. In addition, key technical issues need to be resolved including challenges with DLT scalability, privacy and data architectures.

TI Randomness invalidates criminal smart contracts
SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB A smart contract enforces specific performance on anonymous users without centralization. It facilitates payment equity in commerce by providing irreversible transactions. Smart contracts are also used for illegal activities such as money laundering and ransomware. Such contracts include criminal smart contracts (CSCs), proposed in CCS'16, that can be efficiently implemented in existing scripting languages. This aggravates concerns about the dangers of CSCs. However, PublicLeaks, a CSC for leaking private data, is conditionally implemented as it is influenced by various factors. For example, PublicLeaks does not necessarily reach a desirable terminal state for a criminal leaking private information, and other possible terminal states may invalidate the CSC. In this study, we propose a CSC based on PublicLeaks by formulating random factors such as the donation ratio. Our contract forks into five terminal states, including a unique one in PublicLeaks due to randomness. We simulated the maximal probabilities of these terminal states and found that the desirable terminal state in PublicLeaks is reachable with low probabilities (lower than 25%). The terminal state where the criminal fails to leak private information is attained with relatively high probabilities (over 65%). Therefore, our simulations show that CSCs are not always as powerful as expected, and the risk posed by them can be mitigated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Prototype of running clinical trials in an untrustworthy environment
   using blockchain
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
AB Monitoring and ensuring the integrity of data within the clinical trial process is currently not always feasible with the current research system. We propose a blockchain-based system to make data collected in the clinical trial process immutable, traceable, and potentially more trustworthy. We use raw data from a real completed clinical trial, simulate the trial onto a proof of concept web portal service, and test its resilience to data tampering. We also assess its prospects to provide a traceable and useful audit trail of trial data for regulators, and a flexible service for all members within the clinical trials network. We also improve the way adverse events are currently reported. In conclusion, we advocate that this service could offer an improvement in clinical trial data management, and could bolster trust in the clinical research process and the ease at which regulators can oversee trials.

TI Implementing Blockchains for Efficient Health Care: Systematic Review
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB Background: The decentralized nature of sensitive health information can bring about situations where timely information is unavailable, worsening health outcomes. Furthermore, as patient involvement in health care increases, there is a growing need for patients to access and control their data. Blockchain is a secure, decentralized online ledger that could be used to manage electronic health records (EHRs) efficiently, therefore with the potential to improve health outcomes by creating a conduit for interoperability.
   Objective: This study aimed to perform a systematic review to assess the feasibility of blockchain as a method of managing health care records efficiently.
   Methods: Reviewers identified studies via systematic searches of databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Cochrane Library. Suitability for inclusion of each was assessed independently.
   Results: Of the 71 included studies, the majority discuss potential benefits and limitations without evaluation of their effectiveness, although some systems were tested on live data.
   Conclusions: Blockchain could create a mechanism to manage access to EHRs stored on the cloud. Using a blockchain can increase interoperability while maintaining privacy and security of data. It contains inherent integrity and conforms to strict legal regulations. Increased interoperability would be beneficial for health outcomes. Although this technology is currently unfamiliar to most, investments into creating a sufficiently user-friendly interface and educating users on how best to take advantage of it would lead to improved health outcomes.

TI Blockchain Implementation in Health Care: Protocol for a Systematic
   Review
SO JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB Background: A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, distributed public ledger that acts as a shared and synchronized database that records cryptocurrency transactions. Despite the shift toward digital platforms enabled by electronic medical records, demonstrating a will to reform the health care sector, health systems face issues including security, interoperability, data fragmentation, timely access to patient data, and silos. The application of health care blockchains could enable data interoperability, enhancement of precision medicine, and reduction in prescription frauds through implementing novel methods in access and patient consent.
   Objective: To summarize the evidence on the strategies and frameworks utilized to implement blockchains for patient data in health care to ensure privacy and improve interoperability and scalability. It is anticipated this review will assist in the development of recommendations that will assist key stakeholders in health care blockchain implementation, and we predict that the evidence generated will challenge the health care status quo, moving away from more traditional approaches and facilitating decision making of patients, health care providers, and researchers.
   Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest Technology Collection and Engineering Index will be conducted. Two experienced independent reviewers will conduct titles and abstract screening followed by full-text reading to determine study eligibility. Data will then be extracted onto data extraction forms before using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool to appraise the quality of included randomized studies and the Risk of Bias in nonrandomized studies of Interventions to assess the quality of nonrandomized studies. Data will then be analyzed and synthesized.
   Results: Database searches will be initiated in September 2018. We expect to complete the review in January 2019.
   Conclusions: This review will summarize the strategies and frameworks used to implement blockchains in health care to increase data privacy, interoperability, and scalability. This review will also help clarify if the strategies and frameworks required for the operationalization of blockchains in health care ensure the privacy of patient data while enabling efficiency, interoperability, and scalability.

TI Blockchain-Based Token Sales, Initial Coin Offerings, and the
   Democratization of Public Capital Markets
SO HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
AB Best known for their role in the creation of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, blockchains are revolutionizing the way technology entrepreneurs finance their business enterprises. In 2017 alone, tech entrepreneurs raised over $6 billion through the sale of blockchain-based digital tokens, with some sales lasting mere seconds before selling out. In a token sale, also referred to as an "initial coin offering" or "ICO," organizers of a project sell digital tokens to members of the public to finance the development of new technological platforms and services. After the initial sale, cryptocurrency exchanges scattered across the globe list tokens for trading and facilitate an active secondary market in which wild price fluctuations are common.
   The recent explosion of token sales could mark the beginning of a broader shift in public capital markets. Blockchains drastically reduce the cost of exchanging value and enable anyone to transmit digitized assets around the globe in a highly trusted manner, stoking dreams of truly global capital markets that leverage the power of a blockchain and the Internet to facilitate capital formation. Lacking homogeneity, the status of tokens under U.S. securities laws is unclear. Although the SEC recently issued a Report of Investigation and has initiated several enforcement actions in which it has found that tokens are securities, confusion still surrounds the boundaries between the types of tokens that will be treated as securities and those that will not.
   In this Article, we argue that the SEC and Congress should provide token sellers and the exchanges that facilitate token sales with additional regulatory certainty and a sensible path to compliance. Specifically, we outline extrinsic and intrinsic factors that courts and regulators should consider when applying the Howey test to digital tokens, adoption of which would help resolve the uncertainty surrounding tokens that mix aspects of consumption and use with the potential for profit. We further propose that lawmakers adopt both a compliance-driven safe harbor for online exchanges that list tokens with a reasonable belief that the public sale of such tokens is not a violation of section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 as well as an exemption to the section 5 registration requirement that has been tailored to digital tokens.

TI Medical Data Management on Blockchain with Privacy
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB Medical data are important in diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and medical accident investigation. The integrity and availability of medical data are the basic guarantee for the smooth operation of these activities. The privacy of medical data is a natural demand from the sensitivity of medical data. At present, there are mainly two ways to protect the privacy of medical data. One way is to store medical data in a local database and set up an access control strategy of the database. The other way is to encrypt medical data with the patient's key and to share the key when needed. The problem with the first method is that the data in the local database may be modified or deleted. The problem with the second method is that the key cannot be shared when the patient dies during the diagnosis and treatment. These two problems will damage the availability of data. This paper proposes to establish a shared key that could be reconstructed by the legitimate parties before the process of diagnosis and treatment begins. The data in the diagnosis and treatment process is encrypted and stored in a blockchain using the shared key. The proposal meets the integrity, availability and privacy requirements of medical data. It uses the sibling intractable function families (SIFF) to establish a shared key, and uses the Hyperledger Fabric to store encrypted data. The simulation shows that the system has good efficiency. Additionally, it is the first time to introduce SIFF to a blockchain application.

TI Cracking Bitcoin wallets: I want what you have in the wallets
SO FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE
AB Bitcoin is increasingly popular, which is partly evidenced by the significant increase in its value in recent years. This increase in popularity and value has led to malicious actors stealing, or attempting to steal, Bitcoin wallet private keys in order to gain ownership of the digital currency held in these wallets. To demonstrate this security threat, two Bitcoin wallet software are studied, namely: Multibit HD and Electrum. Each wallet is subject to a combination of a password exploits and a restore wallet exploit. Findings suggest that it is possible to gain access to Multibit HD and Electrum wallets through offline brute force password attempts. Once a password is found, it is possible to restore a wallet with all Bitcoins contained within. This restoration is possible even if access to the Bitcoin wallet has never occurred. These findings highlight the need for more research into Bitcoin wallet security and forensics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Cryptographic primitives in blockchains
SO JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AB Blockchain, as one of the crypto-intensive creatures, has become a very hot topic recently. Although many surveys have recently been dedicated to the security and privacy issues of blockchains, there still lacks a systematic examination on the cryptographic primitives in blockchains. To this end, we in this paper conduct a systematic study on the cryptographic primitives in blockchains by comprehensive analysis on top-30 mainstream cryptocurrencies, in terms of the usages, functionalities, and evolutions of these primitives. We hope that it would be helpful for cryptographers who are going to devote themselves to the blockchain research, and the financial engineers/managers who want to evaluate cryptographic solutions for blockchain-based projects.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB Using the high-frequency data of Bitcoin, this paper investigates the long memory characteristics of the unconditional and conditional volatilities of Bitcoin at different time scales using the local Whittle (LW) estimator, the exact local Whittle (ELW) estimator and the ARMA-FIAPARCH model. The results show that the long memory parameter is significant and quite stable for both unconditional and conditional volatility measures across different time scales. This paper also examines the long memory characteristics of the unconditional and conditional "realized" volatilities of Bitcoin at different time scales using the local Whittle (LW) estimator, exact local Whittle (ELW) estimator and the ARFIMA model. Long memory is found to be significant and stable also in case of unconditional and conditional "realized" volatilities. The study also undertakes quarterly non-overlapping rolling window analysis to develop deeper insights into the evolution of long memory parameter, d, over the period. The results indicate high persistence in the Bitcoin market. This study has useful implications for different investors and market participants having varying exposures in the Bitcoin market depending on their trading horizons. The findings can help them in forecasting the expected volatility in the Bitcoin market and thereby in developing and implementing trading strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Wavelet time-scale persistence analysis of cryptocurrency market returns
   and volatility
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB This paper explores persistence of eight largest cryptocurrency markets using daily data from 25/08/2015-13/03/2018, across time and trading scale. Employing ARFIMAFIGARCH class of models under two different distributions and a modified log-periodogram method, we generally uncovered informational (in)efficiency and volatility persistence to be highly sensitive to time-scale, the measure of returns and volatilities, and regime shift. In particular, evidence of persistence was found to be concealed in full -sample conditional returns and a break regime, where three crypto markets showed characteristics contrary to the Efficient Market Hypothesis. These results suggest that empirical examination of persistence in markets should be mindful of volatility measures, trading horizons, and switching regimes. More so, scale -conscious traders or investors could rely on our findings and the implications thereof in making investment decisions in the market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We employed a rich set of established empirical approaches, including a VAR framework, a copulas approach, and non-parametric drawings, to capture a dependence structure. Using a weekly dataset from 2013 to 2017, our key results suggest that the frequency of Google searches leads to positive returns and a surge in Bitcoin trading volume. Shocks to search values have a positive effect, which persisted for at least a week. Our findings contribute to the debate on cryptocurrencies/Bitcoins and have profound implications in terms of understanding their dynamics, which are of special interest to investors and economic policymakers.

TI A Hybrid Process to Address Uncertainty and Changing Climate Risk in
   Coastal Areas Using Dynamic Adaptive Pathways Planning, Multi-Criteria
   Decision Analysis & Real Options Analysis: A New Zealand Application
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Decision makers face challenges in coastal areas about how to address the effects of ongoing and uncertain sea-level rise. Dynamic adaptive pathways planning (DAPP) and Real Options Analysis (ROA) can support decision makers to address irreducible uncertainties in coastal areas. This paper sets out what we learned by complementing multi-criteria decision analysis with DAPP and ROA when developing a 100-year coastal adaptation strategy in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand. Lessons include the value of collaborative community and decision maker processes for increasing understanding about the changing risk over time, and the need to take early actions that enable a shift in pathway before those actions become ineffective. Modifications to the methods highlighted the importance of using several plausible scenarios for stress-testing options; considering costs and consent-ability early, to avoid the perception that hard protection will last; which criteria are appropriate for communities to assess; and making many pathways visible for future decision makers. We learned about the difficulties shifting thinking from short-term protection actions to longer-term anticipatory strategies. We found that a pathways system will require ongoing political leadership and governance with monitoring systems that can manage the adaptive process over long timeframes, by governments and their constituent communities.

AB New technologies and the knowledge economy are destabilising graduate professions, with artificial intelligence and the analysis of 'big data' making significant impacts on formerly secure jobs. Blockchain technology, offering automated secure credentialling of undergraduate students' activities and achievements, may significantly erode existing systems of assessment. The challenge for universities will be not only to maintain the relevance of their curricula but also to manage erosion of their current near-monopoly in awarding degrees. This paper envisions a landscape in which universities must outsource parts of their course delivery and assessment in order to remain competitive. It examines a potentially sustainable mission strategy: to move away from narrow academic disciplines towards an authentic learning curriculum focusing on the development of students as whole persons with rounded educations. This paper examines implications for the academy of the convergence of artificial intelligence, data analytics and blockchain technology.

Our analysis emphasizes that crypto-currencies systems have a social and economic impact much smaller than that of the traditional financial systems. We present an analysis of the several stages needed to produce an ounce of gold and an artificial agent-based market model simulating the Bitcoin mining process and allowing the quantification of Bitcoin mining costs. In this market model, miners validate the Bitcoin transactions using the proof of work as the consensus mechanism, get a reward in Bitcoins, sell a fraction of them to cover their expenses, and stay competitive in the market by buying and divesting hardware units and adjusting their expenses by turning off/on their machines according to the signals provided by a technical analysis indicator, the so-called relative strength index.

TI Does global economic uncertainty matter for the volatility and hedging
   effectiveness of Bitcoin?
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
AB We assess whether the long-run volatilities of Bitcoin, global equities, commodities, and bonds are affected by global economic policy uncertainty. Empirical results provide evidence supporting this hypothesis, except in the case of bonds. For Bitcoin investors, the results imply the ability to use information about the state of global economic uncertainty to enhance the predictions of Bitcoin volatility. We further examine whether the correlation between Bitcoin and global equities, commodities, and bonds are affected by global economic policy uncertainty. Empirical results reveal that global economic policy uncertainty has a negative significant impact on the Bitcoin-bonds correlation and a positive impact on both Bitcoin-equities and Bitcoin-commodities correlations, suggesting the possibility of Bitcoin acting as a hedge under specific economic uncertainty conditions. Interestingly, the hedging effectiveness of Bitcoin for both global equities and global bonds enhances slightly after considering the level of global economic policy uncertainty. Such a weak effect of the state of global economic uncertainty on the hedging ability of Bitcoin implies that investors cannot substantially enhance the hedging performance of Bitcoin under different economic uncertainty conditions.

TI Food Safety Traceability System Based on Blockchain and EPCIS
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In recent years, food safety issues have drawn growing concerns from society. In order to efficiently detect and prevent food safety problems and trace the accountability, building a reliable traceability system is indispensable. It is especially essential to accurately record, share, and trace the specific data within the whole food supply chain, including the process of production, processing, warehousing, transportation, and retail. The traditional traceability systems have issues, such as data invisibility, tampering, and sensitive information disclosure. The blockchain is a promising technology for the food safety traceability system because of the characteristics, such as the irreversible time vector, smart contract, and consensus algorithm. This paper proposes a food safety traceability system based on the blockchain and the EPC Information Services and develops a prototype system. The management architecture of on-chain & off-chain data is proposed as well, through which the traceability system can alleviate the data explosion issue of the blockchain for the Internet of Things. Furthermore, the enterprise-level smart contract is designed to prevent data tampering and sensitive information disclosure during information interaction among participants. The prototype system was implemented based on the Ethereum. According to the test results, the average time of information query response is around 2 ms, while the amount of on-chain data and query counts are 1 GB and 1000 times/s, respectively.

TI Scalable Byzantine Consensus via Hardware-Assisted Secret Sharing
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS
AB The surging interest in blockchain technology has revitalized the search for effective Byzantine consensus schemes. In particular, the blockchain community has been looking for ways to effectively integrate traditional Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols into a blockchain consensus layer allowing various financial institutions to securely agree on the order of transactions. However, existing BFT protocols can only scale to tens of nodes due to their O(n(2)) message complexity. In this paper, we propose FastBFT, a fast and scalable BFT protocol. At the heart of FastBFT is a novel message aggregation technique that combines hardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs) with lightweight secret sharing. Combining this technique with several other optimizations (i.e., optimistic execution, tree topology and failure detection), FastBFT achieves low latency and high throughput even for large scale networks. Via systematic analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that FastBFT has better scalability and performance than previous BFT protocols.

TI The day-of-the-week pattern of price clustering in Bitcoin
SO APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS
AB Following Urquhart (2017) who finds evidence of price clustering in Bitcoin, we answer the question of whether the documented price clustering in Bitcoin is driven by any given day-of-the-week. We find evidence that Bitcoin prices cluster around whole numbers more on Fridays and least on Mondays. We also show that Bitcoin price clustering around the top three most frequent two-digit decimals is primarily a Friday phenomenon.

TI Blockchain technology for enhancing Check for updates supply chain
   resilience
SO BUSINESS HORIZONS
AB With the soaring value of bitcoin and frenzy over cryptocurrency, the blockchain technology that sparked the bitcoin revolution has received heightened attention from both practitioners and academics. Blockchain technology often causes controversies surrounding its application potential and business ramifications. The blockchain is a peer-to-peer network of information technology that keeps records of digital asset transactions using distributed ledgers that are free from control by intermediaries such as banks and governments. Thus, it can mitigate risks associated with intermediaries' interventions, including hacking, compromised privacy, vulnerability to political turmoil, costly compliance with government rules and regulation, instability of financial institutions, and contractual disputes. This article unlocks the mystique of blockchain technology and discusses ways to leverage blockchain technology to enhance supply chain resilience in times of increased risks and uncertainty.

TI Leveraging the Capabilities of Industry 4.0 for Improving Energy
   Efficiency in Smart Factories
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Factories use many manufacturing processes that consume a lot of energy and highly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. The introduction of the concept of Industrial Internet in USA and Industry 4.0 in Europe offers many opportunities to reduce energy consumption in these factories. Introducing and utilizing smart techniques for the applications pertinent to manufacturing processes within the Industry 4.0 domain can offer many benefits for reducing energy consumption in smart factories. This paper investigates and discusses these opportunities and benefits. This paper also discusses the roles of Industry 4.0 technologies in enabling these opportunities. Consequently, introducing these capabilities will help significantly reduce both production costs and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper then provides a benefit analysis that shows the advantages of such leverage. In addition, this paper offers an enabling architecture and its components that include a cyber-physical system manufacturing services' layer, a fog manufacturing services' layer, a cloud manufacturing services' layer, and a blockchain-based service-oriented middleware to support such opportunities.

TI Blockchain and IoT-Based Cognitive Edge Framework for Sharing Economy
   Services in a Smart City
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based infrastructure to support security- and privacy-oriented spatio-temporal smart contract services for the sustainable Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled sharing economy in mega smart cities. The infrastructure leverages cognitive fog nodes at the edge to host and process offloaded geo-tagged multimedia payload and transactions from a mobile edge and IoT nodes, uses AI for processing and extracting significant event information, produces semantic digital analytics, and saves results in Blockchain and decentralized cloud repositories to facilitate sharing economy services. The framework offers a sustainable incentive mechanism, which can potentially support secure smart city services, such as sharing economy, smart contracts, and cyber-physical interaction with Blockchain and IoT. Our unique contribution is justified by detailed system design and implementation of the framework.

TI Blockchain-Based Soybean Traceability in Agricultural Supply Chain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The globalized production and the distribution of agriculture production bring a renewed focus on the safety, quality, and the validation of several important criteria in agriculture and food supply chains. The growing number of issues related to food safety and contamination risks has established an immense need for effective traceability solution that acts as an essential quality management tool ensuring adequate safety of products in the agricultural supply chain. Blockchain is a disruptive technology that can provide an innovative solution for product traceability in agriculture and food supply chains. Today's agricultural supply chains are complex ecosystem involving several stakeholders making it cumbersome to validate several important criteria such as country of origin, stages in crop development, conformance to quality standards, and monitor yields. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts efficiently perform business transactions for soybean tracking and traceability across the agricultural supply chain. Our proposed solution eliminates the need for a trusted centralized authority, intermediaries and provides transactions records, enhancing efficiency and safety with high integrity, reliability, and security. The proposed solution focuses on the utilization of smart contracts to govern and control all interactions and transactions among all the participants involved within the supply chain ecosystem. All transactions are recorded and stored in the blockchain's immutable ledger with links to a decentralized file system (IPFS) and thus providing to all a high level of transparency and traceability into the supply chain ecosystem in a secure, trusted, reliable, and efficient manner.

TI Trustworthy Electronic Voting Using Adjusted Blockchain Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The electronic voting has emerged over time as a replacement to the paper-based voting to reduce the redundancies and inconsistencies. The historical perspective presented in the last two decades suggests that it has not been so successful due to the security and privacy flaws observed over time. This paper suggests a framework by using effective hashing techniques to ensure the security of the data. The concept of block creation and block sealing is introduced in this paper. The introduction of a block sealing concept helps in making the blockchain adjustable to meet the need of the polling process. The use of consortium blockchain is suggested, which ensures that the blockchain is owned by a governing body (e.g., election commission), and no unauthorized access can be made from outside. The framework proposed in this paper discusses the effectiveness of the polling process, hashing algorithms' utility, block creation and sealing, data accumulation, and result declaration by using the adjustable blockchain method. This paper claims to apprehend the security and data management challenges in blockchain and provides an improved manifestation of the electronic voting process.

TI Blockchain-Powered Value Creation in the 5G and Smart Grid Use Cases
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Before the implementation of a solution, it is cost-efficient and practical to be able to evaluate and analyze the expected value of use cases. Especially, this is emphasized in blockchain (BC) use cases, which typically have a wide business ecosystem and possibly disruptive business models. This paper presents two BC use case value evaluations and results. The IoT use cases were selected from two different industry segments: telecommunications-oriented 5G network slice brokering and the energy industry-related internal electricity allocation in a housing society. The use case value was assessed by applying a resource configuration framework and 4C - commerce, context, content, and connection - business model typology against BC and smart contracts characteristics and capabilities. The results derived from the data collected from the expert workshops proved the expected value of the use cases, and in general, the feasibility of BC technology for facilitating various value-creating resource configuration processes was shown. Furthermore, the resource configuration framework proved to be a valuable theoretical approach for analyzing and developing also the BC-enabled novel use cases and business models. According to the findings, further development of the framework is proposed with an introduced novel decentralized resource configuration prototype that can replace predominant platform-based business models.

TI An Improved Authentication Scheme for Internet of Vehicles Based on
   Blockchain Technology
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Thanks to the rapid development in mobile vehicles and wireless technologies, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has become an attractive application that can provide a large number of mobile services for drivers. Vehicles can be informed of the mobile position, direction, speed, and other real-time information of nearby vehicles to avoid traffic jams and accidents. However, the environments of IoV could be dangerous in the absence of security protections. Due to the openness and self-organization of IoV, there are enormous malicious attackers. To guarantee the safety of mobile services, we propose an effective decentralized authentication mechanism for IoV on the basis of the consensus algorithm of blockchain technology. The simulation under the veins framework is carried out to verify the feasibility of the scheme in reducing the selfish behavior and malicious attacks in IoV.

TI Crypto-Securities Regulation: ICOs, Token Sales and Cryptocurrencies
   under EU Financial Law
SO EUROPEAN COMPANY AND FINANCIAL LAW REVIEW
AB Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, have not only risen to public attention as novel means of payments, but also as facilitators of initial coin offerings (ICOs, also called token sales). In these entirely online-mediated offerings, entrepreneurs sell tokens registered on a blockchain in exchange for cryptocoins. Buyers receive tokens that can be understood as cryptographically-secured coupons which embody a bundle of rights and obligations. In July 2017, the SEC released an investigative report that highlighted that such tokens can be subject to the full scope of US securities regulation. It is unclear, however, to what extent EU securities regulation is applicable to ICOs and, particularly, whether issuers have to publish and register a prospectus in order to avoid criminal and civil prospectus liability in the E U. In conceptual terms, this depends on whether tokens are considered "securities" under the EU prospectus regulation regime. Against this background, this paper develops a nuanced approach that distinguishes between three archetypes of tokens: currency, investment, and utility tokens. It analyzes the differential implications of each of these types, and their hybrid forms, for EU securities regulation, and develops policy proposals for their regulation.

TI Initial Coin Offerings and Agile Practices
SO FUTURE INTERNET
AB An ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is an innovative way to fund projects based on blockchain. The funding is based on the selling of tokens by means of decentralized applications called smart contracts written in Solidity, a programming language specific for Ethereum blockchain. The ICOs work in a volatile context and it is crucial that the team is capable of handling constant changes. The Agile methods, proven practices enabling to develop software in presence of changing requirements, could be a means for managing uncertainty. The main goals of this work are to understand software engineering activities related to ICOs, recognize the ICOs developed using Agile methods, and make a comparison between ICOs and Agile ICOs. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis of Agile ICOs concerning project planning, software development, and code features. Our work shows that the roles of the people involved in an ICO can be compared to the typical roles of the SCRUM methodology. The majority of Agile ICOs use tool of testing before storing smart contract on blockchain. Finally, the application of volumetric and complexity software metrics shows that the files of Agile ICOs is on average shorter and less complex than in other smart contracts.

AB The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly part of daily life. However, the development of IoT applications still faces many problems, such as heterogeneity, complex management, and other difficulties. In this paper, first, the open source technologies of IoT are surveyed. We compare these technologies from the point of view of different levels of technical requirements, such as device management, data management, communication, intelligent data processing, security and privacy protection; we also look at requirements of application development and deployment. Second, an IoT integrated development platform architecture for IoT applications based on open source ecosystem is proposed and evaluated in an industrial setting. We applied P2P technology to distributed resource management and blockchain-based smart contract mechanics for resource billing management. The results show that the IoT gateway based on an open source ecosystem had a stable and reliable system performance with a certain data size and concurrency scale. These conditions satisfy the application requirements of the IoT in most sensing environments.

AB Cryptocurrencies represent a novel method of exchange without physical form, created by the internet to facilitate in making online payments which potentially bring revolution in the social structure of the future economic system. The core objective of this empirical inquiry is to look into the adoption of cryptocurrencies particularly Bitcoin, among the people of mainland China. To carry out the goals, this study was conducted to collect the essential information by applying a structured questionnaire from the people of mainland China via the online data collection system. The sample size is (n = 376) therefore, descriptive statistics, and structural equation modeling (SEM) has been applied to explore the causal relationship between explanatory factors and citizens intention to use. This study proposes that awareness and perceived trustworthiness are comparatively significant factors to determine the intention to use Bitcoin, while perceived usefulness partially mediates the relationship between perceived ease of use and intention to use. This study explores the factors influencing Bitcoin adoption in China demonstrating similarities and differences in terms of global adoption. The outcomes contribute to existing theories of Bitcoin adoption, providing policymakers with insight into how adoption is unfolding in this context.

TI Removal of Anions from Aqueous Media by Means of a Thermoresponsive
   Calix[4]pyrrole Amphiphilic Polymer
SO CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL
AB To address the challenge of removing unwanted anions from aqueous media under extraction-free conditions we have prepared a thermoresponsive amphiphilic polymer with pendent calix[4]pyrrole (C4P) receptors. Because of its amphipathicity, this polymer self-assembles into micelles in water. These micelles contain the C4P receptors buried in a hydrophobic core. This allows uptake of various cesium anions into the micelles. Due to the thermal responsiveness of the hydrophilic block chain, the anion-bearing micelles precipitate in water upon heating. Simple filtration allows their removal from the aqueous environment, thus allowing for effective water purification. Treating the anion-trapped micelles with acidic aqueous solution leads to the competition-induced release of the bound anion and thus recycling the polymeric material.

TI Developing signals to trigger adaptation to sea-level rise
SO ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
AB Dynamic adaptive policy pathways (DAPP) is emerging as a 'fit-for-purpose' method for climate-change adaptation planning to address widening future uncertainty and long planning timeframes. A key component of DAPP is to monitor indicators of change such as flooding and storm events, which can trigger timely adaptive actions (change pathway/behavior) ahead of thresholds. Signals and triggers are needed to support DAPP-the signal provides early warning of the emergence of the trigger (decision-point), and the trigger initiates the process to change pathway before a harmful adaptation-threshold is reached. We demonstrate a new approach to designing signals and triggers using the case of increased flooding as sea level continues to rise. The flooding frequency is framed in terms of probable timing of several events reaching a specific height threshold within a set monitoring period. This framing is well suited to adaptive planning for different hazards, because it allows the period over which threshold exceedances are monitored to be specified, and thus allows action before adaptation-thresholds are reached, while accounting for the potential range of timing and providing a probability of premature warning, or of triggering adaptation too late. For our New Zealand sea level case study, we expect early signals to be observed in 10 year monitoring periods beginning 2021. Some urgency is therefore required to begin the assessment, planning and community engagement required to develop adaptive plans and associated signals and triggers for monitoring. Worldwide, greater urgency is required at tide-dominated sites than those adapted to large storm-surges. Triggers can be designed with confidence that a change in behavior pathway (e.g. relocating communities) will be triggered before an adaptation-threshold occurs. However, it is difficult to avoid the potential for premature adaptation. Therefore, political, social, economic, or cultural signals are also needed to complement the signals and triggers based on coastal-hazard considerations alone.

TI BitCoin exclusively informational money: a valuable review from 2010 to
   2017
SO QUALITY & QUANTITY
AB In this paper, we provide a state of-the-art survey over Bitcoin related technologies and sum up various challenges. Bitcoin is the first and most prevalent decentralized crypto-currency to date. It is decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency in which coins are produced by an appropriated set of excavators and exchange are communicated by means of a peer-to-peer organize. While Bitcoin gives some level of secrecy by urging clients to have any number of irregular looking Bitcoin addresses, late research demonstrates that this level of obscurity is fairly low. This urges clients to associate with the Bitcoin arrange through anonymizers like Tor and propels advancement of default Tor usefulness for prevalent versatile customers. A low-asset aggressor can increase full control of data streams between all clients who utilized Bitcoin over Tor. Specifically, the aggressor can connect together client's exchanges paying little respect to pen names, control which Bitcoin squares and exchanges are handed-off to the client and can defer or dispose of client's exchanges and pieces. Bitcoins have risen as a conceivable competitor to regular monetary forms, yet other crypto-monetary forms have similarly showed up as competitors to the Bitcoin currency. The extending business sector of crypto-monetary forms now includes capital comparable to 1010 US Dollars, furnishing the scholarly community with a bizarre chance to examine the development of significant worth. Bitcoin is an absolutely online virtual currency, unbaked by either physical wares or sovereign commitment; rather, it depends on a mix of cryptographic security and a peer-to-peer protocol for seeing settlements. Understanding Bitcoin related technologies and challenges would help maximize its usage in community.

TI Going Local on a Global Platform: A Critical Analysis of the
   Transformative Potential of Cryptomarkets for Organized Illicit Drug
   Crime
SO INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REVIEW
AB Objective: There is broad agreement in the literature on the transformative potential of drug cryptomarkets that allow sourcing on a global market and consequently the circumvention of existing supply chains between producer and end user. We examine whether the transformative potential of drug cryptomarkets has been realized in two ways: Are cryptomarket drug sellers found in production and transit countries? and Do we see the increased use of shipping across international borders over time? Method: Using data collected by the DATACRYPTO software tool between 2013 and 2016, we characterize cryptomarket buyer behavior through the product reviews (i.e., sales transactions) posted on 15 cryptomarkets. Findings: Cryptomarket drug sellers are predominantly based in countries of Europe, North America, and Oceania. For both cannabis resin and cocaine sold on cryptomarkets, we find that known production and transit countries are not the primary sources of supplied drugs but rather key countries of consumption. In the case of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, we observe that the Netherlands, a known production country, is the largest supplier. We further observe tendencies over time toward increased localization of cryptomarkets with regard to product destinations.

We explain our results with reference to buyers' preferences regarding safety, risk, and convenience, alongside structural limitations for cryptomarket use such as bitcoin availability.

TI Blockchain: A Tale of Two Applications
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Bitcoin continues to get more and more attention from the media, mainly because of the volatility of its value and insignificantly associated with the technological innovation. This cryptocurrency is supported by an immutable database and is distributed throughout a network of thousands of nodes, known as Blockchain. One way to ensure that all the concepts behind the Blockchain technology and infrastructure are seized is to conduct the development of one of the most popular context applications for it: a wallet for well-known cryptocurrencies. Yet Another Bitcoin Wallet (YABW) is a hybrid application available for both Android and iOS, which was developed with the Ionic and Angular frameworks. This application communicates with Bitcoin Blockchain to send, receive and store bitcoins; provides a set of features focused on security and user experience, and is available on the Play Store and Apple Store. A rather relevant issue that is becoming a major subject of current research is the application of the Blockchain infrastructure to other contexts that are neither directly connected to cryptocurrencies, nor are finance related. The implementation of a proof-of-concept application proposes the use of a blockchain for a specific case study: the exchange of meal vouchers of an institution amongst students. This is achieved using the decentralized platform Ethereum, which allows us to create a Smart Contract using the Solidity programming language to create a token that follows the Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC), the ERC-20 standard and represents the meal vouchers. This second application uses the architecture defined for YABW, reusing major components and custom developing specific modules to enhance the required features. There is still a lot of research to be done on the non-financial applicability of the Blockchain infrastructure and technology, but for the moment, we have left further evidence that it is possible and is a relative straight-forward process to accomplish from the technological perspective.

TI Cyber-secure decentralized energy management for IoT-enabled active
   distribution networks
SO JOURNAL OF MODERN POWER SYSTEMS AND CLEAN ENERGY
AB This paper provides a strategic solution for enhancing the cybersecurity of power distribution system operations when information and operation technologies converge in active distribution network (ADN). The paper first investigates the significance of Internet of Things (IoT) in enabling fine-grained observability and controllability of ADN in networked microgrids. Given severe cybersecurity vulnerabilities embedded in conventionally centralized energy management schemes, the paper then proposes a cyber-secure decentralized energy management framework that applies a distributed decision-making intelligence to networked microgrids while securing their individual mandates for optimal operation. In particular, the proposed framework takes advantage of software-defined networking technologies that can secure communications among IoT devices in individual microgrids, and exploits potentials for introducing blockchain technologies that can preserve the integrity of communications among networked microgrids in ADN. Furthermore, the paper presents the details of application scenarios where the proposed framework is employed to secure peer-to-peer transactive energy management based on a set of interoperable blockchains. It is finally concluded that the proposed framework can play a significant role in enhancing the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and sustainability of electricity services in ADN.

TI Classification of cryptocurrency coins and tokens by the dynamics of
   their market capitalizations
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB We empirically verify that the market capitalizations of coins and tokens in the cryptocurrency universe follow power-law distributions with significantly different values for the tail exponent falling between 0.5 and 0.7 for coins, and between 1.0 and 1.3 for tokens. We provide a rationale for this, based on a simple proportional growth with birth and death model previously employed to describe the size distribution of firms, cities, webpages, etc. We empirically validate the model and its main predictions, in terms of proportional growth (Gibrat's Law) of the coins and tokens. Estimating the main parameters of the model, the theoretical predictions for the power-law exponents of coin and token distributions are in remarkable agreement with the empirical estimations, given the simplicity of the model. Our results clearly characterize coins as being 'entrenched incumbents' and tokens as an 'explosive immature ecosystem', largely due to massive and exuberant Initial Coin Offering activity in the token space. The theory predicts that the exponent for tokens should converge to 1 in the future, reflecting a more reasonable rate of new entrants associated with genuine technological innovations.

TI Integrated Energy Transaction Mechanisms Based on Blockchain Technology
SO ENERGIES
AB With the rapid development of distributed renewable energy (DRE), demand response (DR) programs, and the proposal of the energy internet, the current centralized trading of the electricity market model is unable to meet the trading needs of distributed energy. As a decentralized and distributed accounting mode, blockchain technology fits the requirements of distributed energy to participate in the energy market. Corresponding to the transaction principle, a blockchain-based integrated energy transaction mechanism is proposed, which divides the trading process into two stages: the call auction stage and the continues auction stage. The transactions among the electricity and heat market participants were used as examples to explain the details of the trading process. Finally, the smart contracts of the transactions were designed and deployed on the Ethereum private blockchain site to demonstrate the validity of the proposed transaction scheme.

TI OPRCP: approximate nearest neighbor binary search algorithm for hybrid
   data over WMSN blockchain
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
AB In order to prevent sensitive data tampering in the application of security monitoring, intelligent traffic, and other sensitive Internet of Things, the research on WMSN (wireless multimedia sensor networks) application system based on blockchain and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is of great significance. However, WMSN data are characterized by high dimensionality, large scale, and multiple types, so it is challenging to search WMSN data efficiently over blockchain system. This paper proposed a novel One Permutation with Rotation and cross-polytope locality-sensitive hashing (OPRCP) method of approximate nearest neighbor binary query for querying binary hybrid data in the form of WMSN multimedia data (containing two hybrid types of data, such as image-text and image-audio). Firstly, a binary hybrid data index was built with the method of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to retain content similarity among original data objects for performing accurate queries. Secondly, the approximate nearest neighbor search strategy was used in place of the nearest neighbor strategy, to reduce querying time. Finally, a binary hybrid data model was employed to cope with multiple types of data in WMSN and carry out collaborative search of binary hybrid data. The experimental results show that compared with other mainstream methods, the proposed OPRCP method is widely adaptive to massive high-dimensional data in multiple types and can improve the accuracy of query results. The OPRCP method exhibits good performance, effectively saves resources, and reduces query time for a variety of datasets. It is an effective solution to the binary hybrid search of approximate neighbors, and it is applicable to the WMSN data search based on smart contracts in WMSN blockchain systems.

TI A Solution towards Eliminating Transaction Malleability in Bitcoin
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS
AB Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto-currency, which is based on the peer-to-peer network, and was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Bitcoin transactions are written by using a scripting language. The hash value of a transaction's script is used to identify the transaction over the network. In February 2014, a Bitcoin exchange company, Mt. Gox, claimed that they had lost hundreds of millions US dollars worth of Bitcoins in an attack known as transaction malleability. Although known about since 2011, this was the first known attack that resulted in a company loosing multi-millions of US dollars in Bitcoins. Our reason for writing this paper is to understand Bitcoin transaction malleability and to propose an efficient solution. Our solution is a softfork (i.e., it can be gradually implemented). Towards the end of the paper we present a detailed analysis of our scheme with respect to various transaction malleability-based attack scenarios to show that our simple solution can prevent future incidents involving transaction malleability from occurring. We compare our scheme with existing approaches and present an analysis regarding the computational cost and storage requirements of our proposed solution, which shows the feasibility of our proposed scheme.

TI Some risks of tokenization and blockchainizaition of private law
SO COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB The paper focuses on the analysis of the problems that may be driven by mass tokenization of the objects of civil law, i.e. the creation of a digital representation of such objects in the form of a record in blockchain. This occurs where the value of such objects is transferred subsequently by means of disposal of such tokens, which is a subject of separate rights to it. The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations. Provisions of the Belarus Decree "On the development of digital economy" of 21 December 2017 and drafts of the laws on blockchain and ICO, discussed in Russian Parliament and Government are taken to illustrate these problems.

TI Implementation of ICO European best practices by SMEs
SO ECONOMIC ANNALS-XXI
AB The article deals with a new financial tool of attracting capital, known as Initial Coin Offering (ICO). In conditions of reduced banking lending and difficult access to finance for SMEs, ICO is viewed to be one of the possible ways to access capital. It considers the main advantages and disadvantages of ICO performance, including its typical features, challenges and regulatory approaches to tax regulation, cybersecurity. The authors of the article determine stages of the ICO mechanism, identifying potential risks and ways to mitigate them, focusing primarily on the need to control and regulate ICO projects. The authors identify the main types of ICO funding, including hybrid and pure funding. The research contains an analysis of ICO trends and their duration for the period of 2013-2017. The capital raised through ICO performance over the period of 2013-2017 is analysed, and determination of the exponential trend line showing the level of its approximation is determined. The study covers the territorial distribution of ICO, in which the top positions regarding the amount of capital raised by ICO are attributed to the USA and EU member states. The existence of ICO regulation in European countries, such as Switzerland and UK, was defined positive in terms of further development of the relevant regulation in the financial market. The article considers the best ICO practices in EU member states. To mitigate risks relating to ICO performance and to increase the level of investment, it would be reasonable to create regulatory rules in every country where cases of ICO performance are reported, based on the practice of the mentioned European countries. The authors give recommendations regarding ICO regulation in Ukraine, taking into consideration the relevant European experience.

TI Open Information Enterprise Transactions: Business Intelligence and Wash
   and Spoof Transactions in Blockchain and Social Commerce
SO INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS IN ACCOUNTING FINANCE & MANAGEMENT
AB This paper investigates what are referred to as open information transactions'. Such transactions are in contrast to traditional transactions, where typically two parties to a transaction are the only ones with information about the transaction. For example, in a sale, the seller and the purchaser typically are the only ones with information about the transaction. However, some emerging technologies, such as blockchain accounting, supply chain social media, and hashtag commerce are making information about the transactions potentially openly available to others. This paper investigates some of the implications and strategies that include the use of that open information. For example, open information in accounting and supply chain transactions provides the potential for both business intelligence analysis of the information and possibly misleading and illusory transactions, analogous to those that have garnered the recent attention of the Justice Department in cryptocurrencies. Finally, this paper suggests that blockchain transaction processing will provide reliable information in those settings where there is a single truth feed of information flow for the phenomena of interest, no ability to do off-blockchain transactions (or a large penalty cost) and limitation to a single identity for each enterprise on the blockchain.

TI Privacy-Preserving Public Auditing for Non-manager Group Shared Data
SO WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
AB By the widespread use of cloud storage service, users get a lot of conveniences such as low-price file remote storage and flexible file sharing. The research points in cloud computing include the verification of data integrity, the protection of data privacy and flexible data access. The integrity of data is ensured by a challenge-and-response protocol based on the signatures generated by group users. Many existing schemes use group signatures to make sure that the data stored in cloud is intact for the purpose of privacy and anonymity. However, group signatures do not consider user equality and the problem of frameability caused by group managers. Therefore, we propose a data sharing scheme PSFS to support user equality and traceability meanwhile based on our previous work HA-DGSP. PSFS has some secure properties such as correctness, traceability, homomorphic authentication and practical data sharing. The practical data sharing ensures that the data owner won't loss the control of the file data during the sharing and the data owner will get effective incentive of data sharing. The effective incentive is realized by the technology of blockchain. The experimental results show that the communication overhead and computational overhead of PSFS is acceptable.

SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB Quantum computers are expected to have a dramatic impact on numerous fields due to their anticipated ability to solve classes of mathematical problems much more efficiently than their classical counterparts. This particularly applies to domains involving integer factorization and discrete logarithms, such as public key cryptography. In this paper, we consider the threats a quantum-capable adversary could impose on Bitcoin, which currently uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to sign transactions. We then propose a simple but slow commit-delav-reveal protocol, which allows users to securely move their funds from old (non-quantum-resistant) outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme. The transition protocol functions even if ECDSA has already been compromised. While our scheme requires modifications to the Bitcoin protocol, these can be implemented as a soft fork.

We prove a novel theorem improving the FWT algorithm and implement a new prediction method suitable to the multiresolution analysis of streaming univariate datasets using compactly supported Daubechies Wavelets. An effective real value forecast is obtained synthesizing the one step ahead crystal and performing its inverse DWT, using an integrated group of estimating machines. We call Wa.R.P. (Wavelet transform Reduced Predictor) the new prediction method. A case study, testing a cryptocurrency exchange price series, shows that the proposed system can outperform the benchmark methods in terms of forecasting accuracy achieved. This result is confirmed by further tests performed on other time series. Developed in C++, Standard 2014 conformant, the code implementing the FWT and the novel Shift Variance Theorem is available to research purposes and to build efficient industrial applications.

TI ForkBase: An Efficient Storage Engine for Blockchain and Forkable
   Applications
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE VLDB ENDOWMENT
AB Existing data storage systems offer a wide range of functionalities to accommodate an equally diverse range of applications. However, new classes of applications have emerged, e.g., blockchain and collaborative analytics, featuring data versioning, fork semantics, tamper-evidence or any combination thereof. They present new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently support such applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage.
   In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine designed for blockchain and forkable applications. By integrating core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only delivers high performance but also reduces development effort. The storage manages multiversion data and supports two variants of fork semantics which enable different fork worklflows. ForkBase is fast and space efficient, due to a novel index class that supports efficient queries as well as effective detection of duplicate content across data objects, branches and versions. We demonstrate ForkBase's performance using three applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and a collaborative analytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation against respective state-of-the-art solutions. The results show that ForkBase achieves superior performance while significantly lowering the development effort.

Meanwhile, the development and use of environmentally friendly renewables gradually become the basic requirements for the sustainable development in the future society. The integration of blockchain technology with distributed photovoltaic (PV) energy may break the existing pattern where the production, transportation, distribution, and sales of energy are centralized. This paper first reviews the current overall situation of China's distributed PV and further analyzes the policy environment with respect to the development of distributed PV. On the basis of the analysis of the status quo, the paper then discusses the internalities (strengths and weaknesses) and the externalities (opportunities and threats) that have driven the development of China's distributed PV by illustrating the SWOT analysis. The data structure and characteristics of blockchain are analyzed to identify the application mode of blockchain technology in the distributed PV industry for the first time. Through our research, some conclusions and policy proposals are finally put forward to provide support to the formulation of related policy in the Chinese Government and industry association.

TI Fingernail analysis management system using microscopy sensor and
   blockchain technology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
AB In traditional Chinese medicine, the growth situation of the surface of nails reflects the physiological condition of the human body. Diagnosis by nail can effectively predict and prevent disease. Human nails have a high degree of uniqueness, and it can be used for biometric recognition. In this work, microscope sensor was used to capture the clear image and segment the lunula and nail plate effectively through image preprocessing. Fingernails' image is managed as the identity authentication. Histogram of oriented gradients and local binary patterns are used to capture the characteristic value. It uses support vector machine and random forest tree for classification. The performance of each feature extraction algorithm was analyzed for the two classifiers and the deep neural network algorithm was used comparatively. Furthermore, the security and privacy of the Internet of Things is still a challenge. This work uses the highly anonymous blockchain technology to effectively protect data privacy and manage each user's data through the blockchain, in which any change or manipulation can be recorded and tracked, and the data security is improved. Therefore, this article presents a nail analysis management system with the use of microscopy sensor and blockchain.

   Sector and Other Industries
SO MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB The aim of the paper is to conduct a research on an impact of blockchain technology platform on the financial sector through cryptocurrency, and an impact on other industries.. The subject of research is not only this technology but also its commercial exploitation. In order to understand the platform, the starting point of this research is an analysis of how the technology functions, after that the advantages for business and economic transaction are identified, and finally the paper deals with an impact of new technology on business, above all on financial operations. The basic hypothesis is that blockchain has achieved a great impact on financial sector, also it has the potential to radically change only the financial sector but also the way we buy and sell, our interaction with the authorities as a way of verifying the ownership from the authorship and the organic food production. Using the available data and synthesis of knowledge from the fields of technology, economics, finance, and politics, 4 scenarios were set up for the future of underlying technology. The scenario approach combined with trend analysis in order to prove the starting hypothesis with high reliability. The research results show that the technology being investigated already has a profound impact on the financial sector, that it is in the initial phase of changing many industries, with the likelihood that they will change them significantly in the next five to ten years. Businesses increasingly discover the power of this technology to exploit the benefits of the Fourth Technological Revolution.

AB High molecular weight poly(L-lactic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA-PEG-PLLA; PLGL) triblock copolymers with various lengths of the PLLA blocks were synthesized by ringopening polymerization of L-lactide. The amorphous and crystalline PLLA and PLGL films were prepared by hot pressing with different temperature treatments. PLLA and PEG blocks exhibited good miscibility in the amorphous PLGL samples, while phase separation occurred in the crystalline ones. The flexible PEG blocks not only accelerated the crystallization rate of PLLA but also greatly improve its flexibility. The crystallization time of PLGL copolymers shorten to less than 5 min and copolymers showed much better flexibility than neat PLLA, the maximum fracture strain reached about 600% for amorphous sample. The processing time of PLLA was greatly shortened and the brittleness of material was improved.

However, block - chain technology has attracted much attention because of the problems such as single - point error and management overhead of the trust server. Among them, Keyless Signature Infrastructure(KSI) provides integrity by configuring user authentication and global timestamp of distributed server into block chain by using hash-based one-time key. In this paper, we provide confidentiality by applying group key and key management based on multi - solution chain. In addition, we propose a smart home environment that can reduce the storage space by using Extended Merkle Tree and secure and efficient KSI-based authentication and communication with enhanced security strength.

AB Audit logs serve as a critical component in the enterprise business systems that are used for auditing, storing, and tracking changes made to the data. However, audit logs are vulnerable to a series of attacks, which enable adversaries to tamper data and corresponding audit logs. In this paper, we present BlockAudit: a scalable and tamper-proof system that leverages the design properties of audit logs and security guarantees of blockchains to enable secure and trustworthy audit logs. Towards that, we construct the design schema of BlockAudit, and outline its operational procedures. We implement our design on Hyperledger and evaluate its performance in terms of latency, network size, and payload size. Our results show that conventional audit logs can seamlessly transition into Block-Audit to achieve higher security, integrity, and fault tolerance.

In this work, we design a blockchain-based data storage and access framework for PingER (worldwide end-to-end Internet performance measurement project) to remove its total dependence on a centralized repository. We use the permissioned blockchain and Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) for this purpose. In the proposed framework, metadata of the files are stored on the blockchain whereas the actual files are stored off-chain through DHT at multiple locations using a peer-to-peer network of PingER Monitoring Agents. This will provide decentralized storage, distributed processing, and efficient lookup capabilities to the PingER framework.

We define a symbolic and a computational model for reasoning about BitML security. In the symbolic model, participants act according to the semantics of BitML, while in the computational model they exchange bitstrings, and read/append transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. A compiler is provided to translate contracts into standard Bitcoin transactions. Participants can execute a contract by appending these transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, according to their strategies. We prove the correctness of our compiler, showing that computational attacks on compiled contracts are also observable in the symbolic model.

AB Secure and reliable management of identities has become one of the greatest challenges facing cloud computing today, mainly due to the huge number of new cloud-based applications generated by this model, which means more user accounts, passwords, and personal information to provision, monitor, and secure. Currently, identity federation is the most useful solution to overcome the aforementioned issues and simplify the user experience by allowing efficient authentication mechanisms and use of identity information from data distributed across multiple domains. However, this approach creates considerable complexity in managing trust relationships for both the cloud service providers and their clients. Poor management of trust in federated identity management systems brings with it many security, privacy and interoperability issues, which contributes to the reluctance of organizations to move their critical identity data to the cloud. In this paper, we aim to address these issues by introducing a novel trust and identity management model based on the Blockchain for cloud identity management with security and privacy improvements

TI Understanding Internet DDoS Mitigation from Academic and Industrial
   Perspectives
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Defending against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet is a fundamental problem. One practical approach to addressing DDoS attacks is to redirect all destination (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party, DDoS protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., Cloudflare and Akamai), which is well provisioned and equipped with proprietary filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before passing the remaining traffic to the destination. Although such an approach is appealing, as it requires no modification to the existing Internet infrastructure and can scale to handle very large attacks, recent industrial interviews with more than 100 interviewees from over 10 industry segments reveal that this approach alone is not sufficient, especially for large organizations (e.g., Web hosting companies and government) that cannot afford to allow third-parity security-service providers to terminate their network connections. Instead, these organizations have to rely on their ISPs to filter attack traffic. In this paper, we discuss the challenges faced by the ISPs in order to disrupt the Internet security-service market and sketch our solutions, powered by smart contracts.

AB Background: The application of the blockchain technology has shown promises in various areas, such as smart-contracts, Internet of Things, land registry management, identity management, etc. Although Github currently hosts more than three thousand active blockchain software (BCS) projects, a few software engineering research has been conducted on their software engineering practices. Aims: To bridge this gap, we aim to carry out the first formal survey to explore the software engineering practices including requirement analysis, task assignment, testing, and verification of blockchain software projects. Method: We sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified via mining the Github repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. Results: We found that code review and unit testing are the two most effective software development practices among BCS developers. The results suggest that the requirements of BCS projects are mostly identified and selected by community discussion and project owners which is different from requirement collection of general OSS projects. The results also reveal that the development tasks in BCS projects are primarily assigned on voluntary basis, which is the usual task assignment practice for OSS projects. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that standard software engineering methods including testing and security best practices need to be adapted with more seriousness to address unique characteristics of blockchain and mitigate potential threats.

AB Being a new kind of software leveraging blockchain to execute real contracts, smart contracts are in great demand due to many advantages. Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform that supports smart contracts by running them in its virtual machine. To ensure that a smart contract will terminate eventually and prevent abuse of resources, Ethereum charges the developers for deploying smart contracts and the users for executing smart contracts. Although our previous work shows that under-optimized smart contracts may cost more money than necessary, it just lists 7 anti-patterns and the detection method for 3 of them. In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth investigation on such under-optimized smart contracts. We first identify 24 anti-patterns from the execution traces of real smart contracts. Then, we design and develop GasReducer, the first tool to automatically detect all these anti-patterns from the bytecode of smart contracts and replace them with efficient code through bytecode-to-bytecode optimization. Using GasReducer to analyze all smart contracts and their execution traces, we detect 9,490,768 and 557,565,754 anti-pattern instances in deploying and invoking smart contracts, respectively.

TI A Security Authentication Scheme of 5G Ultra-Dense Network Based on
   Block Chain
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The ultra-dense network (UDN) is one of the most promising technologies in the fifth generation (5G) to address the network system capacity issue. However, it is a new challenge that the user equipment (UE) secure access UDN composed of the access points (APs) which characterized with autonomy, temporary, and dynamic. In 5G UDN, the APs are independent and equal. The UDN can be regarded as a decentralized access network. Compared with the traditional base station, the AP has a smaller coverage. There has an issue that the interaction between the UE and APs will be more frequent when UE moves. However, the existing 4G authentication and key agreement algorithm cannot adapt to this fast and frequent authentication requirement. If the UE moves smoothly in a trusted APs group (APG) without frequent authentication, this problem will be solved very well. In order to achieve this goal, we propose a security authentication scheme of 5G UDN based on the block chaining technologies. In this paper, an APG-PBFT algorithm based on the block chaining technology with Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT) consensus algorithm is proposed. In the algorithm, the consensus mechanism will be optimized and a new reverse screening method will be embedded. In our solution, a trusted chain APG can be generated with APs by APG-PBFT algorithm, and the authentication results can be shared in the APG using the blockchain message propagation mechanism. The principle of fast authentication with APG-PBFT algorithm is present in this paper. The scheme can reduce the authentication frequency when UE moves among the APs and improve the access efficiency. Finally, we analyze the performance of APG-PBFT algorithm and compare it with the traditional PBFT algorithm. The simulation results show that the APG-PBFT algorithm can improve the APG generation efficiency and reduce the authentication frequency of UE, which will be valuably applied to the UDN environment.

TI Healthcare services across China - on implementing an extensible

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
AB A basic requirement to provide patient-centric care is to have identifiers serve to link all patient data across multiple systems together to provide a coherent service. In most hospitals today, the lack of a unique patient identifier that works across multiple hospital information systems such as HIS, LIS, PACS, and others means that healthcare providers typically rely on a patient's name, date of birth, and other personal information to identify their medical records in the electronic health record systems. However, this information is not guaranteed to be unique to an individual. It also takes considerable amount of time to check on this or more information and requires much human intervention. As a result, providers often have a difficult time properly identifying patients, thus increase the risk of associating medical information with a wrong patient.

TI ASIC-Resistance of Multi-Hash Proof-of-Work Mechanisms for Blockchain
   Consensus Protocols
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Blockchain technology rapidly gained popularity based on its open and decentralized operation. Consensus protocol is the core mechanism of a blockchain network that securely maintains the distributed ledger from possible attacks from adversaries. Proof-of-work (PoW) is a commonly used consensus protocol that requires a significant amount of computation to find a new valid block. As the application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are specially designed for PoW computation begin to dominate blockchain consensus operation, the decentralized nature of blockchain networks is being threatened. Many PoW mechanisms are being proposed to disincentivize the use of ASICs in the consensus operation. Employing multiple hash functions in the PoW computation (i.e., multi-hash PoW) is one of the commonly adopted approaches to achieve such ASIC-resistance. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate the level of ASIC-resistance of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms. We assess the level of ASIC-resistance based on the performance gap between ASICs and general-purpose computing platforms. Contrary to the expectation of the multi-hash PoW mechanisms, our results reveal that ASIC-resistance of these PoW mechanisms is not strong enough to prevent ASIC-based mining. Most of them show similar levels of ASIC-resistance as those of PoW mechanisms that are already defeated by ASIC-based systems.

Cryptocurrency or virtual currency is a cryptographically protected, decentralized digital currency used as a means of exchange. Due to the development of new technologies and innovations, the rate of use of virtual currency is rapidly increasing throughout the globe, replacing not only cash payments and payments by bank transfer, but also electronic cash payments. Among the best-known representatives of cryptocurrencies are Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. Legal scholars have not yet reached a consensus regarding the nature and legal status of virtual currency. Virtual currency possesses the nature of obligations rights as well as property rights, since it may be both a means of payment and a commodity. Depending on the country, the approach to cryptocurrencies may be different. Today there is already an international cryptocurrency community that does not have a single coordinating center. Only progressive jurisdiction and state regulation of cryptocurrency activity will allow the creation of the conditions that will ensure the implementation of legitimate and safe cryptocurrency relations.

TI SBLWT: A Secure Blockchain Lightweight Wallet Based on Trustzone
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB Due to the increasing total value of the digital currency, the security of encryption wallet is becoming more and more important. The hardware-based wallet is safe, but it is inconvenient because users need to carry an additional physical device, the software-based wallet is convenient, but the safety cannot be guaranteed. All these wallets need to synchronize the blockchain, while most current mobile devices do not have the capability to store all blocks. To solve these problems, mobile devices can use simplified payment verification (SPV). Nevertheless, in existing methods, there is no good way to protect the verification process of the transaction. In this paper, we design a secure blockchain lightweight wallet based on Trustzone to protect SPV. It is more portable compared with the hardware wallet, and safer than the software wallet. Through the isolation, it can also protect the private key and the wallet's address from being stolen by the attackers no matter whether the Rich OS is malicious or not. Meanwhile, it can protect the verification process by verifying transactions in the secure execution environment (SEE), and keep the local block headers unreadable directly from the Rich OS through encryption. We deploy it on the RASPBERRY PI 3 MODEL B development board. The result of the experiment shows that it has little impact on the system.

AB While blockchain services hold great promise to improve many different industries, there are significant cybersecurity concerns which must be addressed. In this paper, we present experimental test bed results for a novel method of user identity management for cloud-based blockchain applications. Using a BlackRidge Technology endpoint on a Windows host, we insert cryptographic identity tokens on the first packet to request a new session. A corresponding gateway appliance in the cloud enforces security policy, blocking unauthorized access at or below the transport layer. Results of penetration testing a sample Hyperledger 1.0 application are discussed. We also demonstrate network segmentation and traffic separation, which allows multiple organizations to share blockchain infrastructure and facilitates compliance auditing.

AB Blockchain technology opens up new opportunities for Business Process Management. This is mainly due to its unprecedented capability to let transactions be automatically executed and recorded by Smart Contracts in multi-peer environments, in a decentralised fashion and without central authoritative players to govern the workflow. In this way, blockchains also provide traceability. Traceability of information plays a pivotal role particularly in those supply chains where multiple parties are involved and rigorous criteria must be fulfilled to lead to a successful outcome. In this paper, we investigate how to run a business process in the context of a supply chain on a blockchain infrastructure so as to provide full traceability of its run-time enactment. Our approach retrieves information to trace process instances execution solely from the transactions written on-chain. To do so, hash-codes are reverse-engineered based on the Solidity Smart Contract encoding of the generating process. We show the results of our investigation by means of an implemented software prototype, with a case study on the reportedly challenging context of the pharmaceutical supply chain.

AB We design and implement TwinsCoin, the first cryptocurrency based on a provably secure and scalable public blockchain design using both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake mechanisms. Different from the proof-of-work based Bitcoin, our construction uses two types of resources, computing power and coins (i.e., stake). The blockchain in our system is more robust than that in a pure proof-of-work based system; even if the adversary controls the majority of mining power, we can still have the chance to secure the system by relying on honest stake. In contrast, Bitcoin blockchain will be insecure if the adversary controls more than 50% of mining power.
   Our design follows a recent provably secure proof-of-work/proof-of-stake hybrid blockchain [11]. In order to make our construction practical, we considerably enhance its design. In particular, we introduce a new strategy for difficulty adjustment in the hybrid blockchain and provide a theoretical analysis of it. We also show how to construct a light client for proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies and evaluate the proposal practically.
   We implement our newdesign. Our implementation uses a recent modular development framework for blockchains, called Scorex. It allows us to change only certain parts of an application leaving other codebase intact. In addition to the blockchain implementation, a testnet is deployed. Source code is publicly available.

TI Banking with blockchain-ed big data
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT ANALYTICS
AB Blockchain is disrupting the banking industry and contributing to the increased big data in banking. However, there exists a gap in research and development into blockchain-ed big data in banking from an academic perspective, and this gap is expected to have a significant negative impact on the adoption and development of blockchain technology for banking. In hope of motivating more active engagement by academics, researchers and bankers alike, we present the most comprehensive review of the impact of blockchain in banking to date by summarizing the opportunities and challenges from a bankers perspective. In addition, we also discuss the impact that big data from blockchain will have on banking data analytics in future and show the increasing importance of filtering and signal extraction for the banking industry. Whilst there is evidence of selected banks adopting blockchain technology in isolation or small groups, we find the need for extensive research and development into several aspects of banking with blockchain to overcome the challenges which are currently hindering its adoption in banking across the globe.

AB Within "Industrie 4.0" approach 3D printing technology is characterized as one of the disruptive innovations. Conventional supply chains are replaced by value-added networks. The spatially distributed development of printed components, e.g. for the rapid delivery of spare parts, creates a new challenge when differentiating between "original part", "copy" or "counterfeit" becomes necessary. This is especially true for safety-critical products. Based on these changes classic branded products adopt the characteristics of licensing models as we know them in the areas of software and digital media. This paper describes the use of digital rights management as a key technology for the successful transition to Additive Manufacturing methods and a key for its commercial implementation and the prevention of intellectual property theft. Risks will be identified along the process chain and solution concepts are presented. These are currently being developed by an 8-partner project named SAMPL (Secure Additive Manufacturing Platform).

AB As a new mechanism to monetize web content, cryptocurrency mining is becoming increasingly popular. The idea is simple: a webpage delivers extra workload (JavaScript) that consumes computational resources on the client machine to solve cryptographic puzzles, typically without notifying users or having explicit user consent. This new mechanism, often heavily abused and thus considered a threat termed "cryptojacking", is estimated to affect over 10 million web users every month; however, only a few anecdotal reports exist so far and little is known about its severeness, infrastructure, and technical characteristics behind the scene. This is likely due to the lack of effective approaches to detect cryptojacking at a large-scale (e.g., VirusTotal).
   In this paper, we take a first step towards an in-depth study over cryptojacking. By leveraging a set of inherent characteristics of cryptojacking scripts, we build CMTracker, a behavior-based detector with two runtime profilers for automatically tracking Cryptocurrency Mining scripts and their related domains. Surprisingly, our approach successfully discovered 2,770 unique cryptojacking samples from 853,936 popular web pages, including 868 among top 100K in Alexa list. Leveraging these samples, we gain a more comprehensive picture of the cryptojacking attacks, including their impact, distribution mechanisms, obfuscation, and attempts to evade detection. For instance, a diverse set of organizations benefit from cryptojacking based on the unique wallet ids. In addition, to stay under the radar, they frequently update their attack domains (fastflux) on the order of days. Many attackers also apply evasion techniques, including limiting the CPU usage, obfuscating the code, etc.

AB Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts the files of infected hosts and demands payment, often in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin. In this paper, we create a measurement framework that we use to perform a large-scale, two-year, end-to-end measurement of ransomware payments, victims, and operators. By combining an array of data sources, including ransomware binaries, seed ransom payments, victim telemetry from infections, and a large database of Bitcoin addresses annotated with their owners, we sketch the outlines of this burgeoning ecosystem and associated third-party infrastructure. In particular, we trace the financial transactions, from the moment victims acquire bitcoins, to when ransomware operators cash them out. We find that many ransomware operators cashed out using BTC-e, a now-defunct Bitcoin exchange. In total we are able to track over $16 million in likely ransom payments made by 19,750 potential victims during a two-year period. While our study focuses on ransomware, our methods are potentially applicable to other cybercriminal operations that have similarly adopted Bitcoin as their payment channel.

AB The blockchain is decentralized network system that verifies the validity of the transaction through the consensus of the verifiers without trusted third parties. This mechanism ensures transaction integrity disclosing transaction information transparently. Therefore, it is emerging as the core technology of the 4th industrial revolution by improving reliability and efficiency with features of decentralization, ensuring the integrity, and economic cost reduction. However, there are some problems with the growth of the blockchain. The popularly used PoW (Proof of Work) consensus algorithm applied to the public blockchain requires the price to be compensated in order to agree on the validity of the transaction. This has the disadvantage that the system doesn't operate without compensation. Also, the BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) Algorithm using private blockchain has a limited number of acceptable malicious users. In this case, if the users collude with malicious and exceed the limited number, the transaction is rejected. In this paper, we propose a Smart Manager System and RMBC-DBFT (Randomized Mesh Blockchain Diversity of opinion BFT) enables the safe transaction to the problems above.

AB Voice over Long Term Evolution (VoLTE) technology defines standards to deliver real-time services such as voice and video over LTE based on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) networks. The security implementation in VoLTE is End-to-Access (e2a), which means that the sessions are only encrypted between the mobile terminals and the IMS network. In this paper we propose a new approach for securing End-to-End (e2e) VoLTE media based the Ethereum Blockchain. The solution consists of creating public and private keypairs for VoLTE user equipments (UEs) and storing the public keys in the Ethereum Blockchain. The media is encrypted e2e using the Secure Real Time Protocol (SRTP) protocol with a variety of session key distribution mechanisms. Results showed that the solution implementation has minimal impact on the existing IMS network, and the secure call setup time between two terminals is negligible compared to the original VoLTE setup time.

Our analysis demonstrates contradictions between these schemes - so clearly they cannot all be right - and also highlights what we feel is a more structural flaw of most of them, namely that they ignore alternatives to blockchain-based solutions. To remedy this, we propose an improved scheme that does take alternatives into account, which we argue is more useful in practice to decide an optimal solution for a particular use case.

AB A wave of alternative coins that can be effectively mined without specialized hardware, and a surge in cryptocurrencies' market value has led to the development of cryptocurrency mining (cryptomining) services, such as Coinhive, which can be easily integrated into websites to monetize the computational power of their visitors. While legitimate website operators are exploring these services as an alternative to advertisements, they have also drawn the attention of cybercriminals: drive-by mining (also known as cryptojacking) is a new web-based attack, in which an infected website secretly executes JavaScript code and/or a WebAssembly module in the user's browser to mine cryptocurrencies without her consent.
   In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on Alexa's Top 1 Million websites to shed light on the prevalence and profitability of this attack. We study the websites affected by drive-by mining to understand the techniques being used to evade detection, and the latest web technologies being exploited to efficiently mine cryptocurrency. As a result of our study, which covers 28 Coinhive-like services that are widely being used by drive-by mining websites, we identified 20 active cryptomining campaigns.
   Motivated by our findings, we investigate possible countermeasures against this type of attack. We discuss how current blacklisting approaches and heuristics based on CPU usage are insufficient, and present MineSweeper, a novel detection technique that is based on the intrinsic characteristics of cryptomining code, and, thus, is resilient to obfuscation. Our approach could be integrated into browsers to warn users about silent cryptomining when visiting websites that do not ask for their consent.

AB Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that became popular as the foundational block of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Over the past few years it has seen a rapid growth, both in terms of research and commercial usage. Due to its decentralized nature and its inherent use of cryptography, Blockchain provides an elegant solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem and is thus a good candidate for use in areas that require a decentralized consensus among untrusted peers, eliminating the need for a central authority. Internet of Things is a technology paradigm where a multitude of small devices, including sensors, actuators and RFID tags, are interconnected via a common communications medium to enable a whole new range of tasks and applications. However, existing IoT installations are often vulnerable and prone to security and privacy concerns. This paper studies the use of Blockchain to strengthen the security of IoT networks through a resilient, decentralized mechanism for the connected home that enhances the network self-defense by safeguarding critical security-related data. This mechanism is developed as part of the Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) project.

AB The Plug-and-Produce concept requires that after connecting a new module to a system, the exchange of the configuration data takes place. As further operation of the system depends on this initialization procedure, it is necessary to ensure that the data presented by the system and the newly attached component is authentic. Therefore, we propose a new concept for secure Plug-and-Produce functionality, which exploits the combination of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) and Blockchain technology. On the one hand, the AAS shall be responsible for presenting uniform and standardized configuration data as well as for storing and managing Blockchain. On the other, Blockchain shall ensure authenticity and integrity of the configuration data.

AB Blockchain (BC), the technology behind the Bitcoin crypto-currency system - is starting to be adopted for ensuring enhanced security and privacy in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Fervent research is currently being focused in both academia and industry in this domain. Proof-of-Work (PoW), a cryptographic puzzle, plays a vital role in ensuring BC security by maintaining a digital ledger of transactions, which are considered to be incorruptible. Furthermore, BC uses a changeable Public Key (PK) to record the identity of users - thus providing an extra layer of privacy. Not only in crypto-currency has the successful adoption of the BC been implemented, but also in multifaceted nonmonetary systems, such as in: distributed storage systems, proof-of-location and healthcare. Recent research articles and projects/applications were surveyed to assess the implementation of the BC for IoT Security and identify associated challenges and propose solutions for BC enabled enhanced security for the IoT ecosystem.

TI Performance Analysis of Hyperledger Fabric Platforms
SO SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS
AB Blockchain is a key technology that has the potential to decentralize the way we store, share, and manage information and data. One of the more recent blockchain platforms that has emerged is Hyperledger Fabric, an open source, permissioned blockchain that was introduced by IBM, first as Hyperledger Fabric v0.6, and then more recently, in 2017, IBM released Hyperledger Fabric v1.0. Although there are many blockchain platforms, there is no clear methodology for evaluating and assessing the different blockchain platforms in terms of their various aspects, such as performance, security, and scalability. In addition, the new version of Hyperledger Fabric was never evaluated against any other blockchain platform. In this paper, we will first conduct a performance analysis of the two versions of Hyperledger Fabric, v0.6 and v1.0. 'I he performance evaluation of the two platforms will be assessed in terms of execution time, latency, and throughput, by varying the workload in each platform up to 10,000 transactions. Second, we will analyze the scalability of the two platforms by varying the number of nodes up to 20 nodes in each platform. Overall, the performance analysis results across all evaluation metrics, scalability, throughput, execution time, and latency, demonstrate that Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 consistently outperforms Hyperledger Fabric v0.6. However, Hyperledger Fabric v1.0 platform performance did not reach the performance level in current traditional database systems under high workload scenarios.

TI Is Blockchain Ready to Revolutionize Online Advertising?
SO IEEE ACCESS
AB The 200-billion-dollar per annum online advertising ecosystem has become infested with thousands of intermediaries exploiting user data and advertising budgets. All key stakeholders in the value-chain are infected: advertisers with fraud, publishers with their diminishing share of advertising budgets, and users with their right to privacy. Blockchain presents a possible solution to addressing the critical issues in the online advertising supply chain. The question remains whether blockchain scalability, energy-efficiency, and token volatility issues can be solved in the coming years to the extent that online advertising could widely leverage trustlessness and the benefits gained from blockchain technology. This paper aims to review the current progress and to open a discussion to address the issues. We present new requirements for blockchain-based online advertising solutions. We have also analyzed the available solutions against the requirements and recommend directions for future research and solution development. Evidence from our research points out that blockchain is not yet ready to be widely implemented in online advertising. More research is needed, and new proof-of-concepts need to be developed before blockchain technology can be considered a trusted alternative for the current online advertising marketplace based on open real-time bidding.

AB The emerging greenhouse technology in agriculture based on Internet of Things (IoT) used for remote monitoring and automation has been rapidly developed. But it still has major concern about security and privacy, due to the large scale of disseminating nature of its network. To overcome these security challenges, we use blockchain which allows the creation of a distributed digital ledger of transactions that is shared among the nodes on IoT network. The main aim of this paper is to provide lightweight blockchain based architecture for smart greenhouse farms to provide security and privacy. Here, IoT devices in greenhouses which act as a blockchain managed centrally to optimize energy consumption have the benefit of private immutable ledgers. In addition, we present a security framework that blends the blockchain technology with IoT devices to provide a secure communication platform in Smart Greenhouse farming.

It was suggested to use the inherent unpredictability of blockchains as a source of public randomness. Entropy from the Bitcoin blockchain in particular has been used in lotteries and has been suggested for a number of other applications ranging from smart contracts to election auditing. In this Arcticle, we analyse this idea and show how an adversary could manipulate these random numbers, even with limited computational power and financial budget.

AB Blockchain technology becomes the key solution to provide trust and security without any need for a central supervisory authority to validate the transactions. By now, it plays a key role in the digital transformation of several processes and industries with varying application use cases. To promote the wide adoption of blockchain technology we need mechanisms to identify the digitizabiity level of the given regulations to smart contracts and mechanisms to specify which blockchain technology is best suitable for the given regulations. In this work, we propose a modeling approach that supports the automated analysis of human-readable regulation representations by suggesting how much percentage of regulation is digitizable and the suitable blockchain environment to design the application. We identify smart contract components that correspond to real-world entities and its pertaining clauses and its digitizabiity property. With selected examples, we explore this capability and discuss our future research directions on smart contract generation according to the recommended environment.

AB In this paper, we present a novel method, process, and system for calculating dyslexic symptoms, generating metric data for an individual user, community, or group in general. We present a mobile multimedia Internet of Things (IoT)-based environment that can capture multimodal smartphone or tab-based user interaction data during dyslexia testing and share it via a mobile edge network, which employs auto-grading algorithms to find dyslexia symptoms. In addition to algorithm-based auto-grading, the captured mobile multimedia payload is stored in a decentralized repository that can be shared with a medical practitioner for replay and further manual analysis purposes. Since the framework is language-independent and based on Blockchain and a decentralized big data repository, dyslexic patterns and a massive amount of captured multimedia IoT test data can be shared for further clinical research, statistical analysis, and quality assurance. Notwithstanding, our proposed Blockchain and off-chain-based decentralized and secure dyslexia data storage, management, and sharing framework will allow security, anonymity, and multimodal visualization of the captured test data for mobile users. This paper presents the detailed design, implementation, and test results, which demonstrate the strong potential for wider adoption of the dyslexia mobile health management globally.

AB Blockchain uses the idea of storing transaction data in the form of a distributed ledger wherein each node in the network stores a current copy of the sequence of transactions (ledger) in the form of a hash chain. Storing the entire ledger incurs a high storage cost that grows undesirably large for high transaction rates and large networks. In this work we use secret key sharing, private key encryption, and distributed storage to design a coding scheme such that each node stores only a part of each transaction thereby reducing storage cost to a fraction of the original. When further using dynamic zone allocation, we show the coding scheme can also improve the data integrity.
